",1/17/2019,"A third-year MBBS student was found shot dead in his hostel room at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) in Sindh's Jamshoro district, officials said on Thursday.

The body of the 20-year-old student was found with a gunshot wound on his temple and a pistol in his right hand; it was subsequently shifted to Liaquat University Hospital's city branch for a post-mortem examination.

LUMHS Vice-Chancellor Dr Bikha Ram said the deceased student was alone in his room in the Ibn-e-Sina hostel. When his roommate â who had gone out to attend some programme â returned to the dorm, he found the room's door locked. He broke it open to find his roommate's body lying on the bed, the VC added.

Police reached the site of the incident and seized the weapon found at the scene.

Dr Ram said he has formed an inquiry committee comprising the hostel provost, director of student affairs, warden and the campus director to determine the circumstances that led to the student's death.

He said the incident was an ""apparent suicide"", but the cause of the death was yet to be determined.

According to the VC, the committee will also investigate how the deceased student had apparently managed to bring the gun to the hostel room. The incident has highlighted the need for some preventative measures to be taken by the hostel administration, Dr Ram said.

Jamshoro Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Tauqir Naeem said the death appeared to be a suicide ""on the face of it"", but added that the incident would be probed.

He said they had learnt that a brother of the deceased was battling cancer while another brother had previously died of the same disease.

Dr Ram also quoted the student's friends as saying that he (the deceased) remained depressed allegedly due to his brother's illness.

According to the VC, the young man had reportedly sent a text message to his roommate saying ""Aaj ki raat bari yadgar hogi (Tonight will be very memorable)"", but the roommate had not understood the meaning of the message at the time.",Mohammad Hussain Khan,Dawn,Mental health,"Jamshoro, youth, suicide, mental health",1,"['thirdyear', 'mbbs', 'student', 'found', 'shot', 'dead', 'hostel', 'room', 'liaquat', 'university', 'medical', 'health', 'sciences', 'lumhs', 'sindh', 'jamshoro', 'district', 'officials', 'said', 'thursday', 'body', '20yearold', 'student', 'found', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'temple', 'pistol', 'right', 'hand', 'subsequently', 'shifted', 'liaquat', 'university', 'hospital', 'city', 'branch', 'postmortem', 'examination', 'lumhs', 'vicechancellor', 'dr', 'bikha', 'ram', 'said', 'deceased', 'student', 'alone', 'room', 'ibnesina', 'hostel', 'roommate', 'gone', 'attend', 'programme', 'returned', 'dorm', 'found', 'room', 'door', 'locked', 'broke', 'open', 'find', 'roommate', 'body', 'lying', 'bed', 'vc', 'added', 'police', 'reached', 'site', 'incident', 'seized', 'weapon', 'found', 'scene', 'dr', 'ram', 'said', 'formed', 'inquiry', 'committee', 'comprising', 'hostel', 'provost', 'director', 'student', 'affairs', 'warden', 'campus', 'director', 'determine', 'circumstances', 'led', 'student', 'death', 'said', 'incident', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'cause', 'death', 'yet', 'determined', 'according', 'vc', 'committee', 'also', 'investigate', 'deceased', 'student', 'apparently', 'managed', 'bring', 'gun', 'hostel', 'room', 'incident', 'highlighted', 'need', 'preventative', 'measures', 'taken', 'hostel', 'administration', 'dr', 'ram', 'said', 'jamshoro', 'senior', 'superintendent', 'police', 'ssp', 'tauqir', 'naeem', 'said', 'death', 'appeared', 'suicide', 'face', 'added', 'incident', 'would', 'probed', 'said', 'learnt', 'brother', 'deceased', 'battling', 'cancer', 'another', 'brother', 'previously', 'died', 'disease', 'dr', 'ram', 'also', 'quoted', 'student', 'friends', 'saying', 'deceased', 'remained', 'depressed', 'allegedly', 'due', 'brother', 'illness', 'according', 'vc', 'young', 'man', 'reportedly', 'sent', 'text', 'message', 'roommate', 'saying', 'aaj', 'ki', 'raat', 'bari', 'yadgar', 'hogi', 'tonight', 'memorable', 'roommate', 'understood', 'meaning', 'message', 'time']"

",1/17/2019,"The federal cabinet has decided to remove the names of PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah from the Exit Control List (ECL), but refuses to excise them from a joint investigation team's (JIT) report on the fake accounts case, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Accountability Mirza Shahzad Akbar stated at an evening press conference on Thursday.

The decision was made in line with a Supreme Court order to the government to remove the two's names from the ECL and review the cabinet decision to place the names of more than 170 accused in the fake bank accounts case on its travel restrictions list.

The orders came in relation to a suo motu case concerning the delays surrounding a 2015 FIA probe into the laundering of billions of rupees via fake bank accounts.

The JIT investigating the case, formed by the apex court itself, had earlier recommended the placement of a total 172 people on the no-fly-list.

Several bigwigs, including former president Asif Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur, former president of Summit Bank Hussain Lawai and Omni Group's Anwar Majeed, have all been nominated in the case. Property tycoon Malik Riaz, his son-in-law Zain have also been included in the probe.

In its detailed verdict after reviewing reports, the court had ordered that the names of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Shah be removed from both the exit control list and the JIT's report.

The court had further ordered that the case be forwarded to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), and directed the anti-corruption watchdog to wrap up its investigation within two months.

Prime Minister Imran Khan, who chaired the cabinet meeting on Thursday, directed the interior ministry to remove Bilawal and Shah's names from the ECL with immediate effect.

Citing some confusions about the apex court's detailed verdict, Akbar told reporters on Thursday that as per the court's orders, the accountability watchdog can still recommend the placement of the names of the Sindh chief minister and the PPP head again on the ECL if it deems it warranted.

Akbar further noted that the Supreme Court's order had directed that the JIT continue to support NAB, and that the watchdog will file a reference without waiting for the apex court's orders [in case it finds sufficient legal grounds to do so]. He also added that the references will be filed in the accountability courts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

The new chief justice will appoint a monitoring judge to the case, he added.

Other developments

Iftikhar Durrani, special assistant to the prime minister on media, also addressed the presser. He said that the cabinet had also approved the placement of the development and non-development budget of the Capital Administration and Development Division under the interior ministry.

The cabinet further approved the auction of 20 ships of the Ministry for National Food Security. The cabinet also approved the appointment of retired Maj Gen Amir Azeem as chairman Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and the appointment of Ali Raza Bhatta, a Grade 21 officer, as secretary of the Benazir Bhutto Income Support Programme.

The cabinet also approved a supplementary grant of Rs750 million for the National Accountability Bureau.

At the onset of the meeting, the prime minister asked two cabinet members, Ali Zaidi and Fawad Chaudhry, to leave the meeting as the Election Commission of Pakistan has suspended their membership of the National Assembly after they, along with 70 other MNAs, failed to submit details of their assets to the commission in time.

'No mini budget but economic reforms package'

Later, while talking to media, Durrani rejected the impression that the government was going to launch a mini budget on Jan 23, 2019. He also categorically denied reports that the government may increase the ratio of sales tax on Jan 23.

""No new tax is going to be introduced,"" he said, adding that the economic reforms package is aimed at enhancing ease of doing business and to provide some incentives to the business community.",Sanaullah Khan | Javed Hussain,Dawn,Politics,"Islamabad, Sindh, PPP, ECL",1,"['federal', 'cabinet', 'decided', 'remove', 'names', 'ppp', 'chairperson', 'bilawal', 'bhuttozardari', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'murad', 'ali', 'shah', 'exit', 'control', 'list', 'ecl', 'refuses', 'excise', 'joint', 'investigation', 'team', 'jit', 'report', 'fake', 'accounts', 'case', 'special', 'assistant', 'prime', 'minister', 'accountability', 'mirza', 'shahzad', 'akbar', 'stated', 'evening', 'press', 'conference', 'thursday', 'decision', 'made', 'line', 'supreme', 'court', 'order', 'government', 'remove', 'two', 'names', 'ecl', 'review', 'cabinet', 'decision', 'place', 'names', '170', 'accused', 'fake', 'bank', 'accounts', 'case', 'travel', 'restrictions', 'list', 'orders', 'came', 'relation', 'suo', 'motu', 'case', 'concerning', 'delays', 'surrounding', '2015', 'fia', 'probe', 'laundering', 'billions', 'rupees', 'via', 'fake', 'bank', 'accounts', 'jit', 'investigating', 'case', 'formed', 'apex', 'court', 'earlier', 'recommended', 'placement', 'total', '172', 'people', 'noflylist', 'several', 'bigwigs', 'including', 'former', 'president', 'asif', 'zardari', 'sister', 'faryal', 'talpur', 'former', 'president', 'summit', 'bank', 'hussain', 'lawai', 'omni', 'group', 'anwar', 'majeed', 'nominated', 'case', 'property', 'tycoon', 'malik', 'riaz', 'soninlaw', 'zain', 'also', 'included', 'probe', 'detailed', 'verdict', 'reviewing', 'reports', 'court', 'ordered', 'names', 'bilawal', 'bhutto', 'zardari', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'murad', 'shah', 'removed', 'exit', 'control', 'list', 'jit', 'report', 'court', 'ordered', 'case', 'forwarded', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'nab', 'directed', 'anticorruption', 'watchdog', 'wrap', 'investigation', 'within', 'two', 'months', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'chaired', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'thursday', 'directed', 'interior', 'ministry', 'remove', 'bilawal', 'shah', 'names', 'ecl', 'immediate', 'effect', 'citing', 'confusions', 'apex', 'court', 'detailed', 'verdict', 'akbar', 'told', 'reporters', 'thursday', 'per', 'court', 'orders', 'accountability', 'watchdog', 'still', 'recommend', 'placement', 'names', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'ppp', 'head', 'ecl', 'deems', 'warranted', 'akbar', 'noted', 'supreme', 'court', 'order', 'directed', 'jit', 'continue', 'support', 'nab', 'watchdog', 'file', 'reference', 'without', 'waiting', 'apex', 'court', 'orders', 'case', 'finds', 'sufficient', 'legal', 'grounds', 'also', 'added', 'references', 'filed', 'accountability', 'courts', 'islamabad', 'rawalpindi', 'new', 'chief', 'justice', 'appoint', 'monitoring', 'judge', 'case', 'added', 'developments', 'iftikhar', 'durrani', 'special', 'assistant', 'prime', 'minister', 'media', 'also', 'addressed', 'presser', 'said', 'cabinet', 'also', 'approved', 'placement', 'development', 'nondevelopment', 'budget', 'capital', 'administration', 'development', 'division', 'interior', 'ministry', 'cabinet', 'approved', 'auction', '20', 'ships', 'ministry', 'national', 'food', 'security', 'cabinet', 'also', 'approved', 'appointment', 'retired', 'maj', 'gen', 'amir', 'azeem', 'chairman', 'pakistan', 'telecommunication', 'authority', 'appointment', 'ali', 'raza', 'bhatta', 'grade', '21', 'officer', 'secretary', 'benazir', 'bhutto', 'income', 'support', 'programme', 'cabinet', 'also', 'approved', 'supplementary', 'grant', 'rs750', 'million', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'onset', 'meeting', 'prime', 'minister', 'asked', 'two', 'cabinet', 'members', 'ali', 'zaidi', 'fawad', 'chaudhry', 'leave', 'meeting', 'election', 'commission', 'pakistan', 'suspended', 'membership', 'national', 'assembly', 'along', '70', 'mnas', 'failed', 'submit', 'details', 'assets', 'commission', 'time', 'mini', 'budget', 'economic', 'reforms', 'package', 'later', 'talking', 'media', 'durrani', 'rejected', 'impression', 'government', 'going', 'launch', 'mini', 'budget', 'jan', '23', '2019', 'also', 'categorically', 'denied', 'reports', 'government', 'may', 'increase', 'ratio', 'sales', 'tax', 'jan', '23', 'new', 'tax', 'going', 'introduced', 'said', 'adding', 'economic', 'reforms', 'package', 'aimed', 'enhancing', 'ease', 'business', 'provide', 'incentives', 'business', 'community']"

",1/17/2019,"Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday telephoned Prime Minister Imran Khan to discuss the ongoing international efforts for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.

During the call, Ghani ""expressed his gratitude for Pakistanâs sincere facilitation of these efforts"" that were initiated by US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office said.

Khan assured the Afghan president that Pakistan was making ""sincere efforts for a negotiated settlement"" of the Afghan conflict through an inclusive peace process, ""as part of shared responsibility"".

Ghani invited the premier to visit Afghanistan at his earliest convenience and Khan reciprocated by inviting the Afghan president to visit Pakistan.

""Both leaders also agreed to remain engaged and create an environment for resolving all outstanding issues,"" the press release said.

The conversation between the two leaders comes as Khalilzad earlier today arrived in Pakistan as part of a regional tour to four countries for talks on the Afghan peace process.

According to the Foreign Office, the US special envoy is expected to meet Pakistan's civilian and military leaders during his stay and he will ask Pakistan to help convince the Afghan Taliban to come to the negotiating table. ""Pakistan has also maintained [that] we want an Afghan-led Afghan-owned solution to [the] imbroglio,"" the FO spokesperson said in a statement.

Pakistan is believed to be making serious efforts to arrange a meeting between Khalilzad and Afghan Taliban leaders in Islamabad to help break the deadlock and speed up the Afghan peace process, Dawn reported.

The US envoy is actively trying to broker a political solution to the Afghan conflict and has held multiple meetings with the leadership of Afghanistan as well as that of other countries in the region, including Pakistan.

",1/17/2019,"Complete address by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa on January 17, 2019 at the full court reference for Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar shared by the Supreme Court of Pakistan

Honourable Chief Justice and my brother Judges, Attorney-General for Pakistan, Vice-Chairman, Pakistan Bar Council, President, Supreme Court Bar Association, Members of the Bar, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen.

The Honourable Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar and I have been conjoined judicial twins for the last about twenty years and eight months.

In the medical jargon conjoined twins are twins whose bodies are connected to each other and it is through a very complicated surgical intervention that such twins may be separated. Mian Sahib and I were elevated to the Bench of the Lahore High Court together on May 21, 1998, we were deposed together on November 03, 2007, we were restored together on August 30, 2008 and we were elevated to the Bench of this Court together on February 18, 2010. In the High Court as well as in this Court our seniority has been next to each otherâs and throughout this period of more than two decades we have sat on seats in the tea rooms of the Courts placed next to each other.

During all this while we have been physically together and I may, therefore, not be wrong in saying that we have been conjoined judicial twins.

Alas, by the stroke of midnight tonight these twins shall stand separated physically not through any surgical intervention but through a constitutional intervention and I must hasten to add that the loss through such separation shall be entirely mine. A sincere friend, a trusted confidant, a wise counsel and an accomplished and erudite Judge like Mian Sahib shall no longer be available on the Bench to help, advise and guide me.

The speakers before me have already spoken about how good a Judge Mian Sahib has been.

I can vouch for that and may add that I have served with more than a hundred Judges of the Lahore High Court and of this Court so far and I have found Mian Sahibâs mastery over civil, tax, revenue, service and constitutional law enviable and difficult to match. I have also served with a number of Chief Justices of the Lahore High Court and of this Court and I have no hesitation in acknowledging that Mian Sahib will go down in history as one of those Chief Justices who steered the Court quite ably in testing times.

The tenure of Mian Sahib as the Chief Justice of Pakistan fell in times which were turbulent, to say the least. The saga of the Panama Papers, the issues of constitutional disqualification of political leaders, the events leading to holding of the general elections in the country and the issues arising out of the national effort against terrorism, extremism, corruption and poor governance posed huge challenges but Mian Sahib was able to wade through all those troubled waters and to steer the ship of this Court to safe and still waters.

Despite his preoccupation with such larger national issues he also devoted his attention to many issues of public importance regarding the citizensâ fundamental rights. His keen interest in provision of clean drinking water in cities, removal of encroachments upon the State land, adequate medical facilities in hospitals, proper management of medical and legal education, supply of pure milk, recovery of written-off bank loans, proper investigation of mega corruption scams, population welfare, building of dams and water reservoirs, retirement of national debt and in some other areas of public importance has sensitised the governments and the populace at large on such vital issues. His efforts made towards police reforms are also likely to lead to an upturn in administration of justice.

Mian Sahib, your contributions in all these areas have left a mark and we shall always remember you with admiration and reverence.

Ladies and gentlemen,

As is customary, let us now have a peep into the near future.

With an experience of over two decades as a Judge and with the support of my colleagues also having vast experience I would, if Almighty Allah so wills, like to avail every moment of my remaining time on the Bench to attend to the causes that contribute towards delay in disposition of cases at all levels of the judicial hierarchy.

With an untiring effort of my colleagues having expertise on the criminal side we have already succeeded in deciding thousands of criminal cases and in wiping out the backlog of such cases in this Court and we are now left with only a few hundred pending criminal cases which can be termed as current cases. Such a target and success have seldom been achieved in any Court before and this has been possible in this Court only because the cause-list of the day was kept in control and there was a uniform policy of not entertaining or discouraging applications for adjournment. We understand that for a legal practitioner there cannot be an obligation or engagement more pressing or urgent than to appear before the Court when his or her case is fixed before the Court for hearing. We on the Bench greatly appreciate the cooperation extended to us by the learned counsel in this respect. An effort shall be made to extend and follow the same policy in all other categories of cases as well and we expect the learned counsel to extend similar cooperation to us even in those cases.

For facilitation of the learned counsel and in order to minimise the chances of adjournments modern technology shall be utilized and a possibility shall be explored regarding establishing video links between the Branch Registries of this Court and the Principal Seat through which the learned counsel may address arguments in the courtrooms of the Branch Registries and appropriate Benches of this Court may hear those arguments at the Principal Seat in real time and decide cases. Such innovation may reduce inconvenience and huge expense on the part of all concerned besides diminishing delays caused by non-availability of Benches at the Branch Registries of the Court.

The model courts set up in some of the Districts of the Punjab upon my initiative and under the patronage of Mian Sahib and supervision of Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah when his lordship was the Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court conducted and concluded trials of criminal as well as civil cases in three to four days rather than three to four years as was the case in the yesteryears.

With the approval and cooperation of the High Courts an all-out effort shall be made to expand the said project to the entire country. Even the steps taken towards judicially conducted arbitral interventions during criminal, civil and family litigation have yielded very positive results in the said Province and expansion of the said project shall also be explored seriously.

Mian Sahib had once observed publically that he is left with only two ambitions in life, i.e. to build dams and to retire the national debt. I would also like to build some dams, a dam against undue and unnecessary delays in judicial determination of cases, a dam against frivolous litigation and a dam against fake witnesses and false testimonies and would also try to retire a debt, the debt of pending cases which must be decided at the earliest possible.

I can anticipate that some of the steps to be taken in these areas may face some resistance or reluctance from those who are used to the old ways but I am sure that the results to be achieved will convince all concerned of utility and usefulness of such steps. I would like to assure you that all such steps will be taken in the best interests of the institution of judiciary and that in all manner of circumstances we shall like and prefer to be correct rather than erratic and proper rather than popular.

There are about 1.9 million cases pending in the country before all the courts put together and to handle such a huge number of cases there are only about 3000 Judges and Magistrates available from top to bottom.

Successive governments have failed to suitably increase the number of Judges and Magistrates on account of financial constraints.

3000 Judges and Magistrates cannot handle 1.9 million cases even if they work for 36 hours a day.

It is, therefore, time to take some big and hard decisions. It is also time to introduce some structural and systemic changes so as to minimize litigation, eliminate unnecessary delays and rationalize the workload. Time has also come when the judicial system as a whole needs to be redesigned or restructured and made simple and effective.

The four-tier judicial hierarchy in the country ought to be replaced with a three-tier system wherein there should be the District Judiciary as the trial court for all civil and criminal cases, the Provincial High Courts as the courts of appeal in all cases and the Supreme Court as the last resort.

All questions of fact must attain finality at the level of the High Court and the Supreme Court ought to attend only to interpretation of the Constitution and laws.

All the Special Courts ought to be abolished and there ought to be one hierarchy of courts with specified judges of the District Judiciary attending to cases under the special laws like drugs, banking, narcotics, corruption, terrorism, labour, intellectual property and consumer protection, etc. with appeals in such cases going to the High Courts. The special courts created under a Federal statute may be financed and administered by the Federal Government but they may fit into the same hierarchy. Having only one judicial hierarchy may eliminate jurisdictional disputes as well as the delay caused in resolving such disputes.

Military Courts trying civilians in criminal cases are universally perceived as an aberration propelled by necessity and expediency. If the legislature, in its own wisdom, decides to continue with such courts for the time being then it may consider providing for appeals from their decisions to lie before a High Court so as to adjust such courts in the normal judicial hierarchy and to ensure that expediency does not trump justice.

The already blurred distinction between Regular First Appeal, Regular Second Appeal, Revision petition and First Appeal against Order, etc. before the High Court ought to be done away with and in a three-tier judicial hierarchy a right of appeal may be provided against all orders or judgments of the trial court with a clear provision requiring the appeals against interim orders of the trial courts to be filed with an advance notice to the opposite party and such appeals may be finally decided within a few days.

Shorter formats of judgments and orders ought to be introduced so that time of the courts is not wasted in writing unnecessary details and, as far as possible, law clerks, research assistants and judgment writers may be provided to the judges at all levels so that their time may be saved in matters of research and drafting.

The constitutional jurisdiction of a High Court must be exercised within its prescribed limits and resort to it as a matter of course as the next available remedy has to be stopped or discouraged. For constitutional cases of national importance a Constitution Bench may be administratively carved out in this Court from within the strength of the Court keeping in view the seniority of the relevant Judges and reflecting the Federal character as far as practicable.

My colleagues and I would also want this Court to attend to many laws which are either unnecessary or their wrongful utilization is clogging the courts. It shall be suggested to the legislature that such unnecessary or problematic laws ought to be repealed or suitably amended and in case of failure of the legislature to attend to the said issue such laws may be judicially scrutinized. There are also some issues of public importance with reference to enforcement of fundamental rights of the citizens which have hitherto remained unattended and an effort shall be made to attend to those issues in all earnestness within the shortest possible time.

Suo motu exercise of this Courtâs jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution shall be exercised very sparingly and only in respect of larger issues of national importance where either there is no other adequate or efficacious remedy available or the available constitutional or legal remedies are ineffective or are rendered incapacitated.

Either through a Full Court meeting or through a judicial exercise an effort shall be made to determine and lay down the scope and parameters of exercise of the original jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution and, if deemed appropriate, to carve out the scope of an Intra-Court Appeal in such matters through an appropriate amendment of the Supreme Court Rules or to suitably amend the provisions relating to review jurisdiction so as to enlarge its scope in such cases.

I am conscious that the issues being faced by the justice sector are gigantic but I may assure you that no stone shall be left unturned in attending to such issues and in trying to improve the situation. With Baloch blood running in my veins I shall fight till the end and I am confident that with the support and cooperation of my colleagues and the Bar the struggle shall bear fruit.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let us admit that in the recent past there has been a trust deficit between different organs of the State and every organ has reasons for sticking to its declared position. There is no gainsaying that all the three organs of the State, i.e. the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive are always to strive hard for exercising their powers and performing their functions to the best of their abilities while maintaining their independence and operational autonomy but at the same time when it comes to steering the ship of the State and handling the larger national issues all such organs are to work in tandem in finding solutions which advance the spirit and purposes of the Constitution. The constitutional doctrine of separation of powers is sound and valid so far as the institutional and operational independence of every organ of the State is concerned but nothing in the said doctrine demands institutional isolation or forbids collective efforts to achieve common good. In my humble estimation time has come when we should put our heads together and in the spirit of truth and reconciliation discuss the larger issues jeopardizing good governance.

Let us discuss with open minds where the judiciary, the executive and the legislature have gone wrong in the past. Let us discuss where each otherâs domain has been encroached upon in the past and try to resolve such issues through a mutually agreed course of action. Let us discuss the alleged encroachment of the executive domain by the judiciary through interference in matters of policy, the alleged excessive use of its constitutional jurisdiction in matters which are administrative in nature and how best the judiciary can return to its normal but effective adjudicatory role. Let us also discuss why the judiciary is struggling hard while trying to handle huge influx of cases and where the other organs of the State have so far failed to provide it the requisite support. Let us also discuss how the legislature can be restricted to its legislative domain and how the legislators can be held back to their legislative role rather than encroaching upon the executive domain through development funds and through interference in appointment, posting, transfer or promotion of public servants which is the main breeding ground for misuse of authority, corruption, lack of merit, inefficiency and the resultant bad governance. Let us discuss how the executive authorities and departments are to be kept operationally autonomous in administrative matters while implementing the policies of the political executive so as to ensure good governance. Let us also discuss, without mincing words or feeling shy, the role of the armed forces and the intelligence agencies in the governance paradigm. Civilian supremacy as well as civilian accountability are sine qua non for democratic sustainability. Let us deliberate how civilian supremacy can be ensured alongside civilian accountability without the process of accountability destabilizing democracy. And, let us not forget or fail to discuss the issue of missing persons and of enforced disappearances and their adverse impact upon the constitutional scheme of things as well as national cohesion. It needs to be realized and appreciated by all the stakeholders that statecraft is too serious a business to be reduced to a game of hide and seek and that in a constitutional democracy national security cannot be pursued by employing methods which are offensive to the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights to life and liberty. Instead of adopting a trigger-happy approach or a devil may care attitude on these delicate and sensitive issues we need to find solutions from within the Constitution and the law. Let us, therefore, sit together and discuss. Let us not keep drifting or floating aimlessly. Time has come to reflect upon the past, learn from the mistakes and to define the future course of action with clarity lest the rudderless ship may be swept away by the storm of unbridled emotions and selfish short-sightedness. Let us not shy away from all such critical issues or look the other way in careless abandon and let us catch the bull by its horns if we want to make any progress as a forward looking and democratic nation governed by a Constitution. Let us call a spade a spade, rise to the occasion and try to emulate our founding fathers in an effort to rebuild our nation on the foundations of freedom envisioned by our revered elders.

I would, therefore, with the approval and support of my colleagues, propose holding of an inter-institutional dialogue at the summit level and would request the worthy President of Pakistan to convene a meeting and to chair the deliberations. I am of the opinion that we have reached a stage in our national life where we must take stock of the mistakes committed in the past and to come up with a Charter of Governance so as to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in future. I would propose that such a summit may be attended by the top parliamentary leadership, the top judicial leadership and the top executive leadership including the military and the intelligence agencies. After bringing all such major stakeholders in the national governance on one table under the patronage of the President of Pakistan an effort should be made through such proposed exercise to heal the wounds of the past, attend to the sore points and work out a practicable policy framework whereunder every organ and institution of the State exercises its powers and performs its functions within its constitutionally defined limits. The sole purpose of the proposed exercise should be to bolster constitutionalism and rule of law, strengthen democracy and create an environment wherein the State and all its organs and institutions may be able to devote their wholehearted attention to the real issues of the citizens of this great country and, as envisaged in the Preamble to our Constitution, âSo that the people of Pakistan may prosper and attain their rightful and honoured place amongst the nations of the World and make their full contribution towards international peace and progress and happiness of humanityâ.

In the end, with fondest of memories and with every good wish I on my own behalf and also on behalf of all my colleagues bid farewell to our very dear friend, our illustrious colleague and our distinguished Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar. Sir, we shall all miss you on the Bench but at the same time all of us pray for your good health, long life and further fruitful contributions in diverse walks of life in the days to come.

",1/17/2019,"Over a period of more than 19 years, the judge has decided about 55,000 cases, including several high-profile ones.

Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, who will be sworn in as the 26th chief justice of Pakistan on Friday (January 18), was born on December 21, 1954 in Dera Ghazi Khan. He is married with two daughters and four grandchildren.

Justice Khosa's brothers are former bureaucrat Nasir Mahmood Khosa and former inspector general of police (IGP) of Balochistan Tariq Masood Khosa.

The judge, who is now 64 years old, received his undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Punjab and his LLM degree from Queens College at Cambridge in 1978.

Read: 'Suo motu notices to be taken sparingly,' says Justice Khosa

He enrolled as an advocate at the Lahore High Court in 1979, and then at the Supreme Court in 1985. As an advocate, he conducted over 600 cases. On February 18, 2010, Justice Khosa was elevated to the position of a Supreme Court judge.

Justice Khosa, over a period of more than 19-and-a-half years, has decided about 55,000 cases.

A special bench headed by Justice Khosa has decided over 10,000 cases of a criminal nature since 2014, according to an article published by The Express Tribune last year. âThe total number of pending cases in the top court has reached near 40,000 and a few hundreds of criminal cases are left, which is being considered as a landmark achievement of the apex court,â the article read.

'Poetic justice'

Justice Khosa is known for adding lyrical flair in his observations and judgments â most recently in the landmark Panama papers verdict that de-seated Nawaz Sharif as the prime minister in 2017.

His dissenting note in the split 2:3 verdict â Khosa was among the two who held Nawaz should be disqualified â on April 20, 2017 began with a reference to the popular 1969 novel âThe Godfatherâ by Mario Puzo in which he pointed out an epigraph by Honore de Balzac selected by the author: ""Behind every great fortune there is a crime"", saying that ""It is ironical and a sheer coincidence that the present case revolves around that very sentence attributed to Balzac.""

The literary reference became a major talking point as opposition parties, in particular the PTI, latched onto it to drive home the allegations of corruption while PML-N spoke out against the choice of analogy.

Nawaz was subsequently disqualified under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution in July the same year.

Read Khosa's article, written when he was a barrister, critical of the ambiguity inherent in Articles 62 and 63 here.

In 2012, when a SC bench â headed by headed by Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk â slapped former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani with a contempt charge, Justice Khosa authored an additional note along with the detailed judgement which included an original rendition of Khalil Gibranâs poem 'Pity the nation'.

Justice Khosa was also part of two high-profile blasphemy-related cases; he headed the bench which upheld the conviction of Mumtaz Qadri in 2015 for the murder of former Punjab governor Salman Taseer and last year in October, he was part of the bench that acquitted Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy charges.

Justice Khosaâs razor-sharp critique of the prosecution case is combined with remarkable judicial prose â lawyer Faisal Siddiqi

A column written by lawyer Faisal Siddiqi published in Dawn on the verdict in the Aasia Bibi case noted:

""Justice Khosaâs razor-sharp critique of the prosecution case is combined with remarkable judicial prose, when he appears to regret the imprisonment of Aasia Bibi by holding that 'Blasphemy is a serious offence but the insult of the appellantâs [Aasia Bibiâs] religion and religious sensibilities by the complainant party and then mixing truth with falsehood â¦ was also not short of being blasphemous â¦ in the circumstances of the present case she appears to be a person, in the words of Shakespeareâs King Lear, âmore sinned against than sinningâ.""

Next in line

Justice Khosa has authored multiple books during his career, including 'Heeding the Constitution', 'Constitutional Apologues', and 'Judging with Passion and Breaking New Ground'.

He also edited and compiled âThe Constitution of Pakistan, 1973â with all amendments up to date.

The next in line to take reins of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Justice Khosa has previously served as the acting chief justice from June 5-11 in 2017, June 29 to July 5 in 2017, May 14-30 in 2018, and Dec 17-23 in 2018.

",1/17/2019,"Prime Minister Imran Khan in a tweet on Thursday asked why lawmakers were ""so scared"" of the Exit Control List (ECL) and why they were so keen to go abroad.

The tweet comes ahead of a federal cabinet meeting today, in which the removal of the name of PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari â among others â from the ECL is expected to be discussed, DawnNewsTV reported. According to Radio Pakistan, the cabinet meeting will also discuss the overall political and economic situation of the country.

""There is so much work to be done by politicians in and for Pakistan â the land they claim to love but some cannot wait to take frequent trips abroad and lawmakers have iqamas or residences abroad,"" Prime Minister Khan added in his tweet.

""Can anyone explain this strange phenomenon to those of us who would be quite happy to remain in and work for Pakistan because we actually love Pakistan,"" the premier asked in another tweet.

Shortly after, Bilawal replied to the premier on Twitter, saying: ""Obviously selected PM doesn't understand the concept of human rights or freedom of movement.""

""Funny itâs only the opposition members on ECL, government members are busy travelling. Including PM who despite promising not to travel for first six months has made more than seven trips so far!,"" the PPP chairman added.

On the recommendations of the joint investigation team (JIT) tasked with probing the fake accounts case, the federal cabinet had in its meeting on December 27, 2018 decided to place the names of 172 individuals â who were named in the investigation report â on the ECL, including Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Faryal Talpur, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Farooq H Naek and several other leaders and provincial ministers belonging to the PPP.

Last week, Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar had grilled the state prosecutor over why the government had decided to place names of Bilawal and the Sindh chief minister on the no-fly list based on JIT's recommendation, ordering the federal cabinet to reconsider its ""hasty decision"".

The government, however, had said it would wait for the court's written judgement.

During a National Assembly session on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi regretted that the government had shown haste in placing the names of 172 people on the ECL.

Attempting to placate the PPP, Qureshi said that the matter was discussed in a federal cabinet meeting and the government had decided to wait until the detailed verdict is released.

According to Qureshi, the top court had ordered the government to consider the removal of the travel ban, not to take the names off the list immediately.

Later in the day on Wednesday, the Supreme Court finally released its order pertaining to the removal of the names of Bilawal as well as Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah from ECL, noting: ""Removing of the names will not prevent NAB [National Accountability Bureau] to probe and in case sufficient material is found connecting these individuals with cognisable offences, it will not be precluded from making an appropriate request to the federal government to place their names on [the] ECL again or take any appropriate action provided by law.""",Dawn.com,Dawn,Politics,"ECL, Bilawal Bhutto, Supreme Court, Imran Khan",1,"['prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'tweet', 'thursday', 'asked', 'lawmakers', 'scared', 'exit', 'control', 'list', 'ecl', 'keen', 'go', 'abroad', 'tweet', 'comes', 'ahead', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'today', 'removal', 'name', 'ppp', 'chairperson', 'bilawal', 'bhutto', 'zardari', 'among', 'others', 'ecl', 'expected', 'discussed', 'dawnnewstv', 'reported', 'according', 'radio', 'pakistan', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'also', 'discuss', 'overall', 'political', 'economic', 'situation', 'country', 'much', 'work', 'done', 'politicians', 'pakistan', 'land', 'claim', 'love', 'wait', 'take', 'frequent', 'trips', 'abroad', 'lawmakers', 'iqamas', 'residences', 'abroad', 'prime', 'minister', 'khan', 'added', 'tweet', 'anyone', 'explain', 'strange', 'phenomenon', 'us', 'would', 'quite', 'happy', 'remain', 'work', 'pakistan', 'actually', 'love', 'pakistan', 'premier', 'asked', 'another', 'tweet', 'shortly', 'bilawal', 'replied', 'premier', 'twitter', 'saying', 'obviously', 'selected', 'pm', 'nt', 'understand', 'concept', 'human', 'rights', 'freedom', 'movement', 'funny', 'itas', 'opposition', 'members', 'ecl', 'government', 'members', 'busy', 'travelling', 'including', 'pm', 'despite', 'promising', 'travel', 'first', 'six', 'months', 'made', 'seven', 'trips', 'far', 'ppp', 'chairman', 'added', 'recommendations', 'joint', 'investigation', 'team', 'jit', 'tasked', 'probing', 'fake', 'accounts', 'case', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'december', '27', '2018', 'decided', 'place', 'names', '172', 'individuals', 'named', 'investigation', 'report', 'ecl', 'including', 'asif', 'ali', 'zardari', 'bilawal', 'bhuttozardari', 'faryal', 'talpur', 'chief', 'minister', 'murad', 'ali', 'shah', 'farooq', 'h', 'naek', 'several', 'leaders', 'provincial', 'ministers', 'belonging', 'ppp', 'last', 'week', 'chief', 'justice', 'pakistan', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'grilled', 'state', 'prosecutor', 'government', 'decided', 'place', 'names', 'bilawal', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'nofly', 'list', 'based', 'jit', 'recommendation', 'ordering', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'reconsider', 'hasty', 'decision', 'government', 'however', 'said', 'would', 'wait', 'court', 'written', 'judgement', 'national', 'assembly', 'session', 'wednesday', 'foreign', 'minister', 'shah', 'mahmood', 'qureshi', 'regretted', 'government', 'shown', 'haste', 'placing', 'names', '172', 'people', 'ecl', 'attempting', 'placate', 'ppp', 'qureshi', 'said', 'matter', 'discussed', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'government', 'decided', 'wait', 'detailed', 'verdict', 'released', 'according', 'qureshi', 'top', 'court', 'ordered', 'government', 'consider', 'removal', 'travel', 'ban', 'take', 'names', 'list', 'immediately', 'later', 'day', 'wednesday', 'supreme', 'court', 'finally', 'released', 'order', 'pertaining', 'removal', 'names', 'bilawal', 'well', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'murad', 'ali', 'shah', 'ecl', 'noting', 'removing', 'names', 'prevent', 'nab', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'probe', 'case', 'sufficient', 'material', 'found', 'connecting', 'individuals', 'cognisable', 'offences', 'precluded', 'making', 'appropriate', 'request', 'federal', 'government', 'place', 'names', 'ecl', 'take', 'appropriate', 'action', 'provided', 'law']"

",1/17/2019,"A full court reference in honour of the retiring Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mian Saqib Nisar, was held in Court No. 1 of the Supreme Court on Thursday.

The ceremony in Islamabad was attended by all Supreme Court judges â with the exception of Justice Mansoor Ali Shah â as well as Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Anwar Mansoor, Vice Chairman of Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) Kamran Murtaza, retired senior judges as well as senior journalists, among others. Justice Nisar's family was also in attendance.

While addressing the gathering, Justice Nisar said the top court has passed many landmark verdicts. ""First is the Gilgit-Baltistan's verdict.""

""Supreme Court took notice of the scarcity of water in the country. The entire nation gave donations to solve the crisis. Second issue the court picked up was that of population growth,"" he said.

""[Judiciary] worked for the rights of the downtrodden, granted overseas Pakistanis the right to vote and gave every person the right to live with dignity. Court also took notice of private hospital charges, issuance of national identity cards by National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to transgenders.

""The court also took notice of Tayyaba torture case as well as the issue of children working as domestic servants.

""[I] tried to return the respect given by the people and tried to solve the issues plaguing sectors of health and education, both of which are rights granted to citizens by the Constitution.

""The role of a judge is never easy, I am aware that the decisions we make shape not just the day to day lives of individuals, but have the potential to mould the lives of generations to come.

""Fear has no place in a judgeâs life, nor does the fear of opposition bring so much as a wrinkle on his forehead, for his only duty is to the Constitution and the people for whom he stands as a beacon of justice

""I worked within the code of conduct for judges and it has been my honour to have served the nation.""

The CJP thanked his fellow judges; ""those who have laid down their robes and those who grace the bench with me today, for always extending their unqualified support to me in all my efforts in dispensing justice and for working tirelessly round the clock"".

""I am also grateful to the employees of the Supreme Court and particularly each and every member of my staff, all of whom have invested long hours with me.

""I am highly indebted to my beautiful family [...] I would not be here today if it were not for you all.""

'Suo motu notices to be taken sparingly'

Addressing the full court reference, chief justice-designate Justice Asif Saeed Khosa said that he had been working alongside Justice Nisar for 20 years but will now have to part ways as per the law.

He said that the outgoing chief justice had faced many constitutional, societal and political challenges during his tenure and headed the judiciary in ""very difficult circumstances"".

Justice Nisar's services for humanitarian causes will be remembered, he added.

Read the full text of Justice Khosa's address here.

Outlining his plan for his upcoming tenure as top judge, Justice Khosa said that he will ensure the quick dispensation of justice.

Referring to Justice Nisar's efforts to raise donations to build the Diamer-Bhasha dams, Justice Khosa said that he too he wanted to build a dam.

""Mian Sahib had once observed publically that he is left with only two ambitions in life, i.e. to build dams and to retire the national debt.

""I would also like to build some dams, a dam against undue and unnecessary delays in judicial determination of cases, a dam against frivolous litigation and a dam against fake witnesses and false testimonies and would also try to retire a debt, the debt of pending cases which must be decided at the earliest possible.

""Currently there are 1.9 million cases pending in courts. Three thousand judges cannot dispense of so many cases,"" Justice Khosa noted.

""The power to take suo motu notices will be used sparingly,"" said the incoming CJP, ""and only in respect of larger issues of national importance where either there is no other adequate or efficacious remedy available or the available constitutional or legal remedies are ineffective or are rendered incapacitated"".

Speaking on the role of other courts, the SC judge said: ""The trial of a civilian in a military court is considered wrong across the world. It is said that military courts take less time to issue verdicts. Civilian courts should try to resolve cases in a short period of time. High courts should exercise powers within their jurisdiction.""

""When has the judiciary interfered in the matters of other institutions?"" Justice Khosa asked. ""Army and intelligence agencies should not interfere in civilian matters.""

""The job of the parliament is to legislate, not provide development funds. Transfers and postings are not among the parliament's duties either.""

PBC's Vice Chairman Murtaza, while speaking at the ceremony, said that Justice Nisar had availed the authority granted to judiciary under Article 184(3) (Original jurisdiction of Supreme Court). Murtaza said that while he was one of the opponents of Article 184(3), he had no doubts about the intentions of Justice Nisar. However, Murtaza said, the ""matter of Article 184(3)'s limitations must be resolved"".

Murtaza lauded Justice Nisar's ""extraordinary"" service as chief justice and wondered if the Supreme Court, as an institution, would be able to continue performing in a similar manner. He stressed the need for the introduction of institutional reforms.

""Chief Justice Saqib Nisar is a very capable person,"" Murtaza declared.

President of Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Amanullah Kanrani also addressed the ceremony and said that recently ""the judges' tone has become so harsh that it distracts the court and lawyers from their basic purpose"".

""Lawyers are not given a chance to present facts and arguments,"" he said. He further said that the ""huge amount of suo motu cases"" leads to a delay in the proceedings of other petitions. Kanrani also suggested that the appellants be allowed to appeal against the verdicts passed in suo motu cases.

The SCBA president also said that ""informal remarks"" passed by judges and lawyers during court proceedings affect the ""minds of petitioners"". Kanrani insisted that there was a need to hold judges accountable.

Justice Nisar's legacy

Justice Nisar was sworn in as the top judge on Dec 31, 2016. After he hangs up his robes today, Justice Khosa will take over the reins of the Supreme Court of Pakistan tomorrow when he will be administered the oath by President Arif Alvi.

Earlier in the day, after adjourning a hearing of his last case, Justice Nisar said he was ""thankful to everyone"".

""I spent more than 20 years in judiciary. I always tried to issue verdicts in accordance with the law and regulations,"" he said.

Among Justice Nisar's retirement plans are to open a ""free legal clinic"". ""I will offer free legal assistance to the oppressed, poor and helpless people at my free legal clinic,"" he had disclosed, stressing that the country belongs to the disadvantaged populace as much as it does to those from the more privileged sections of society.

Herald's 'Person of the Year 2018': Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, for judging too much

The outgoing chief justice passed several landmark judgements during his tenure as top judge â including the verdict in the Aasia Bibi case last year. He also headed the bench which decided that disqualification handed down under Article 62 (1)(f) of the Constitution would be for life.

The defining feature of his tenure, however, may be his judicial activism and frequent suo motu notices. Justice Nisar created headlines not just in the courtrooms, but by visits all over the country â to hospitals, filtration plants, lower court rooms and even prisons. Everywhere that the chief justice went, the cameras followed.

He also set up a fund for the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and initiated a campaign to raise awareness about population control.

At the full court reference that was held for his predecessor, former chief justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali, Justice Nisar in his address â which many believed was an insight into his plan of action as top judge â had declared that the judiciary will not tolerate corruption in any form.

Take a look: In search of a legacy

âThe act of corruption by state actors is a complete fraud on the exercise of their power may it be the executive or judicial limbs of the state,â Justice Nisar had observed and cautioned that it should be very clearly understood that besides cleaning ââour own house of corruption, the judiciary would play its role in the eradication of corruption from other limbs of the governmentââ.

Justice Nisar's judicial career

Justice Nisar has been a judge of the apex court since Feb 18, 2010. Before that he was a judge of the Lahore High Court (LHC).

Before being appointed as a judge, he was member of the Supreme Court Bar AssociaÂ­tion and Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA). He was elected as secretary general of the LHCBA in 1991.

He joined the legal profession as an advocate on May 2, 1980. He was enrolled as an advocate of the high court in 1982 and advocate of the Supreme Court in 1994.

He was elevated as the judge of the high court on May 22, 1998, and of the Supreme Court on Feb 18, 2010.

Justice Nisar specialised in civil, commercial, tax and constitutional laws and appeared in a large number of important constitutional cases both in the LHC and the Supreme Court.

He was appointed as the federal law secretary on March 29, 1997, when he became the first member of the bar to be appointed to the important position.

Justice Nisar represented Pakistan in an international conference held at the Wilton Park, United Kingdom, on the subject of âPakistan and India at Fiftyâ.

He led a Pakistani delegation to a conference in Manila on the subject of âAsia Region Transitional Crimesâ. He also attended conferences in Switzerland and Norway.

He had also been a part-time lecturer at the Punjab Law College and Pakistan College of Law, where he taught civil procedure code and the Constitution.",Dawn.com | Haseeb

",1/17/2019,"âI donât feel like Iâm in another country. Pakistanis have given me so much love. Iâm overwhelmed. I feel very lucky.â

This is how Indian actress Aditi Singh expressed herself at a press meet held at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday evening.

Ms Singh, who has worked in Pakistani film Wajood directed by Javed Sheikh, said she feels fortunate to have been asked to come to the press club. She was also happy that Pakistani actress Meera had accompanied her to the presser. Meera was the one who, when she first saw her in Wajood, had remarked that Javed Sheikh had cast a doll-like girl in his film.

Ms Singh said whatever she has achieved as an actress so far is because of the media and the way it has encouraged her presence in Pakistan. âArtists are nothing without the mediaâs support.â

Cast of Wajood.

Ms Singh told journalists that her maternal uncle, actor Aditya Pancholi, had told her that she would get a lot of love from Pakistan just as he did. Itâs true. She has not yet felt that sheâs not in her own house [country]. She is overwhelmed by the love that Pakistanis have given her. There are so many families here who have made her a member of their households.

Answering a question whether there are any technical differences between working in Indian and Pakistani films, she replied thereâs none. The Pakistani industry is growing a lot, though the pace is slow. Pakistani mediaâs future is bright. The content being used here is of high quality. Responding to a query, she said sheâd like to work with Pakistani artists Ali Zafar, Hamza Ali Abbasi and Meera.

Ms Singh began her film career with a Telugu film Guppedanth Prem and went on to do another Telugu movie Nenu Kidnap Iyanu before coming to Pakistan.

Prior to her address, Meera read out a speech (though earlier journalists were told that sheâs going to play a recorded message because she wasnât feeling well). She welcomed Ms Singh to the club and thanked the Pakistan Film TV Journalists Association for arranging the event.

Ms Meera said the club had gathered ambassadors of two countries under one roof. Though the countries had different borders, their people love each other. Borders could be far from each other but not the hearts of the people. There are a number of political and ideological differences between India and Pakistan, but when it comes to culture and the film industry, art is not confined to borders. Heads of state require formal invitations to visit one anotherâs countries, not the artist community. Artists cannot be stopped by foreign policy to cross into another country. The only thing that artists look for is love.

Ms Meera said she recently met Indian actor Sonu Sood in Dubai. He expressed his desire to come to Pakistan and wished that Meeraâs upcoming film Baji is released in India. She also met Poonam Dhillon, who too wants to visit Pakistan.

The office bearers (Imtiaz Faran, Arman Sabir, Raja Kamran) and some members of the governing body of the Karachi Press Club formally welcomed the two guests. Wasi Qureshi conducted the programme.

11,https://www.dawn.com/news/1458101/khizar-hayats-case-should-serve-as-an-opportunity-for-introspection-for-the-government,"Khizar Hayat's case should serve as an opportunity for introspection for the government
",1/17/2019,"KHIZAR Hayat did not know how close he came to death this past weekend. Itâs not as if nobody told him. He just cannot understand what an execution is.

In fact, even though he has been on death row since 2003, he does not know why he is in jail. The anti-psychotic medication he has been on has proven to be less and less effective with each passing year. Solitary confinement has only made his condition worse.

On Friday, Jan 11, the government of Pakistan issued Khizarâs execution warrant. He would be executed before sunrise on Jan 15. His mother, Iqbal Bano, was inconsolable. This is, unfortunately, not the first time Iqbal Bano has been dragged through this ordeal. Khizar was issued two execution warrants in 2015, one in 2017, and was about to earn the macabre status of being Pakistanâs first execution of 2019.

The Imdad Ali case: Why executing a mental patient is severely problematic

Every single one of those execution orders directly contravenes Pakistanâs international human rights obligations, domestic laws and expert medical opinion.

So why do they keep getting issued?

On death row since 2003, Khizar does not know why he is in jail.

In April 2016, before he was chief justice, Justice Saqib Nisar told a room full of psychiatrists that the laws must be tightened to protect the mentally ill.

But in the same year, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of Imdad Ali, another death-row prisoner with a severe mental disability on the premise that schizophrenia is ânot a mental illnessâ. Criticism stemming from the publicâs more straightforward conception of mental illness saved Imdadâs life at the eleventh hour.

In May 2017, Justice Umar Ata Bandial also stated at a conference that it would âbe unfair to punish the mentally illâ.

These were encouraging indicators that perhaps, finally, it was being recognised that mentally ill defendants lack the criminal intent to warrant the same punishment as the mentally able.

In April 2018, Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, while hearing the cases of Kanizan Bibi and Imdad Ali, made headlines across Pakistan by categorically ruling out execution for prisoners with mental disabilities. âBeyond sense or reason,â he rightly declared in open court, âthat we hang the mentally ill.â He immediately ordered that Kanizan be transferred to a secure mental health facility to get the treatment she needs. Fresh medical reviews have been ordered for both, and the case has been dubbed âprecedent-settingâ for the rights of the mentally disabled.

While these two cases remain pending before the Supreme Court, in December 2018, the Lahore High Court dismissed a petition seeking Khizarâs transfer to a mental health facility. It stated that âemotional disorders of like nature were not viewed as factors sufficient enough to impede executionâ. Not only did this clear the pathway to Khizarâs execution but also exposed demonstrably mentally ill prisoners like Kanizan, Imdad and Saleem to the same fate.

Luckily, the National Commission on Human Rights was quick to act. It issued an order restraining the relevant authorities from scheduling Khizarâs hanging until the matter is decided by the Supreme Court. Jail authorities were not only copied in the order that was issued, they were also present at the hearing. They were party to the statements. They cannot claim ignorance.

The government of Pakistan should use this case as an opportunity for introspection. When the jury was, quite literally, still out on the matter of mentally ill prisoners â how could the lower courts so openly disregard the Supreme Court? How were the orders of the Pakistani governmentâs foremost human rights body defied so blatantly by jail authorities?

This breakdown of communications can prove to be deadly. Had the campaign mobilised by Justice Project Pakistan not caught the attention of the chief justice, had voices of influence not been moved enough to amplify their platforms and privilege, had the deluge of appeals to the president to accept his appeal for clemency stemmed, Khizar would have been a dead man by now.

Every prisoner with a history of mental illness should have their sentences commuted without delay. This is the very least that Pakistanâs obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights demand.

President Arif Alvi has Khizarâs mercy petition before him. It contains details of his mental illness, the laws that confirm that his execution would be wrongful, as well as a reminder of Pakistanâs international commitments. It makes for a useful and life-saving document.

The right to seek pardon belongs to the people. It is not just a private act of grace but a meaningful safeguard against any mistakes that might have been made during sentencing. And in Khizarâs case, it is exactly what justice looks like.

",1/17/2019,"GILGIT: Senator Talha Mahmood claimed to set a record by hunting an ibex with 54 inches horns in Passu valley of Hunza district here on Tuesday.

The lawmaker, who was accompanied by a local guide in the expedition, told reporters that Gilgit-Baltistan had the largest wildlife habitat in Asia and therefore, it could attract foreigners in large numbers for lawful hunting.

The wildlife department officials said Senator Talha had obtained the trophy hunting licence by paying the permit fee to the GB government for hunting ibex.

They said the lawmaker had been hunting animals in GB for the five years.

GB conservator (wildlife and parks) Yaqoob Ali Khan said more than 40 wildlife species had so far been hunted in the region under the 2018-19 trophy hunting programme.

He said people from within the country and the US and Europe got hunting permits.

The official said the wildlife department had auctioned the hunting licence in Oct last year under the 2018-19 trophy hunting programme.

He said the wildlife department was doing its best to check illegal hunting across the region despite being short staffed.

Meanwhile, the police arrested a man for illegally hunting an ibex in Passu valley of Hunza.

",1/17/2019,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday decided to immediately recruit 15,000 employees, including 6,000 police constables and officers, in seven merged districts of the province previously known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

The decision was made during a high-level meeting held here with Governor Shah Farman in the chair.

Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, adviser to the prime minister on establishment Mohammad Shahzad Arbab, provincial ministers and senior officers also attended the meeting.

Minister says govt wants local body polls held in erstwhile Fata before PAâs

Information minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai later told reporters that around 30,000 posts of different departments and attached directorates had been lying vacant in seven merged districts.

He said it had been decided to fill 15,000 posts, including 6,000 for police personnel.

The minister said priority for those jobs would be given to local residents. He said officers of the police would also be deployed in seven merged districts to perform their duties along with Levies and Khasadar.

Mr Yousafzai said all relevant departments had been directed to expedite development activities in different sectors, while the timeline of three months had been set for the execution of all schemes to ensure early implementation of projects.

He said the departments and directorates would inform the relevant authorities about vacant posts so that they could be filled within the stipulated period.

The minister said process for holding local government elections in the region was also discussed.

He said the government wanted to hold the local body elections in seven tribal districts before elections for the KP Assembly there.

Mr Yousafzai said the delimitation process had been completed and that the government would ask the Election Commission of Pakistan to announce date for local government polls in the area.

He said the relevant department had been directed to install solar panels in 300 mosques of the region within three months.

The minister said 16 grid stations would be upgraded, while work on 10MW hydel power generation unit in Kurram district would begin very soon.

He said municipal services would be extended to 25 tehsils by March 31.

Mr Yousafzai said the government had accorded top priority to the development of education and health sectors with missing facilities being provided to educational institutions and health centres.

Advisor to the chief minister on education Ziaullah Bangash said budget for the education sector totaled Rs18 billion, including Rs4 billion for the development side.

He said the board of governors for the governorâs model schools would be changed with the immediate priority of the department being the resolution of the issue of attendance in schools.

Mr Bangash said the directorate of education for seven tribal districts had been merged with the province, while the independent monitoring units had begun working in the region to find out missing facilities in schools besides ensuring presence of teachers on duty.

The information minister said the facility of Sehat Insaf Card would be extended to all tribal districts with half of the million families getting cards.

He said the distribution of those cards would begin on Jan 31.

Mr Yousafzai said the hospital administrations had been directed to ensure the provision of emergency medicines in all tribal districts so that the people couldnât face any problem in getting treatment.

He said the Sports Gala would be organised in tribal districts in Feb, while cultural festivals would be held there in the same month.

",1/17/2019,"ISLAMABAD: After being censured by the Supreme Court (SC) the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has taken over possession of 237 kanals from locals of Chattha Bakhtawar for the construction of the King Hamad Nursing University.

CDA had acquired over 900 kanals in Chattha Bakhtawar in 1981 but there was a dispute between locals and the civic agency regarding the compensation amount.

Due to this dispute, the civic agency was unable to get possession of the land. But some years ago, when King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain had announced funding for a nursing university, the CDA had allotted 237 kanals to the health ministry for the construction of the varsity even though it did not have possession of the said land.

Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had in Jan 2017 laid the foundation stone of the university but construction work could not be started due to the compensation dispute.

SC had recently reprimanded CDA officers for the civic agencyâs failure in taking possession of the land and made directions that it should ensure possession.

The civic agency on Wednesday conducted an operation and handed over the land to the health ministry after getting possession. The health ministry will start construction work in collaboration with the government of Bahrain.

CDA spokesperson Syed Safdar Ali said that 15 built-up-properties (BUP) were demolished during the operation and that 17 families were given allotment letters for alternative plots in compensation for their demolished BUPs.

He said CDA had also made arrangements to pay compensation on the spot and that cheques were distributed among the people from whom the land was acquired.

âThe process was completed amicably and with no untoward incident,â he said, adding that after vacation, the land was handed over to the concerned department.

A camp office has been established at the site for the facilitation of locals whose land has been acquired.

Sources said that CDA had decided to give an 8pc increase in the rate of land per annum from the date of the award announced in 1981 to get possession of the over 900 kanals.

The sources also said that according to the CDA Ordinance of 1960, the civic agency could not give an 8pc increase as it did not get possession of the land.

Clause 32-A of the 1960 ordinance says, âPayment of additional compensation: When the amount of the compensation determined under section 29 and sub section (3) of section 30 is not paid or deposited with the deputy commissioner shall, in addition to such compensation, pay additional compensation computed at the rate of eight per centum per annum on such compensation from the time of so taking the possession until it has been so paid or depositedâ.

However, sources said the step was taken as it would have been unfair to compensate locals in 2019 at the rate in vogue in 1981.

CDA Deputy Commissioner Qazi Shoaib said cases related to the Chatta Bakhtawar award had been in litigation in various courts for years.

âSo we decided to amicably resolve it,â he said, and that an 8pc per annum amount is justified with the current market rate.

The land award was announced in 1981 but after 35 years, the CDA announced a controversial BUP award in 2016, saying that 782 people were eligible for an initial BUP award.

The National Accountability Bureau is currently conducting an investigation into bogus BUP awards.

",1/17/2019,"ISLAMABAD: With the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) saying it needs six months to determine the law under which to file a reference, a subcommittee of the Public Accounts Committee has decided in principle to carry out a forensic audit of the Islamabad International Airport.

The subcommittee, which is led by PTI MNA Syed Fakhar Imam, has also directed the auditor general to determine whether delays in the project were caused by the contractor or the government.

The audit department has said it is quite capable of carrying out the audit as it is already auditing a private firm on Supreme Court orders, but would officially consent after a week.

NAB tells subcommittee it needs six months to determine the law under which to file a reference

While discussing delays in the escalation in cost for the airport from Rs37 billion to Rs105bn, the subcommittee was informed that the PAC has already referred some audit objections to NAB. However, a NAB official said the bureau would need six months to determine under which law it should file its reference, for which it will also consult with law experts at universities.

PML-N MNA Rana Tanveer Hussain said the six month wait would be too long, adding: âWhen you want to file references or take action against politicians you donât even take a month to do it.â

Pakistan Engineering Council Chairman Jawed Salim Qureshi intervened in the discussion and said that in other countries, forensic audits are used to fix responsibility in such cases.

He added that here, government departments â try to accept responsibility to protect the contractor from finesâ.

Forensic audits investigate why a project was delayed and who was responsible, he said, adding: âIt is inquired from the government department if it asked the contractor why the project was delayed and what the contractorâs reply was.â

Mr Qureshi also alleged that the project cost was deliberately stated to be Rs37bn instead of Rs81bn so âsmall and incompetent companies would be able to win the contractâ.

Audit Works (Federal)Director General Mohammad Azhar told the subcommittee earlier that four inquiries have been conducted over delays in the completion of the airport.

âThe ground-breaking of the project was held on April 7, 2007, and the project had to be completed within 30 months. However, at the time of the ground-breaking ceremony, the design of the project was not ready and even the PC-I was not approved. Even after 18 months, work on the runway was done again as work done at the time of the ground-breaking was destroyed,â he said.

Mr Azhar said that while the initial cost of the project was Rs37bn, a Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) report had revealed that a number of components were not included in the project. The realistic cost of the project, he said, was Rs81bn.

âHowever even that price escalated and reached over Rs105bn. We have raised a number of objections and even the FIA report shows that our objections were correct,â he said.

An Aviation Division official attributed the increase in cost to the decision to upgrade technology, and the foreign exchange conversion rate.

The official said the SC took note of the issue in September 2013, after which retired Lt Gen Shahid Nawaz carried out an inquiry and a review committee, headed by Shamsul Mulk, also looked into the matter.

The IIA project was conceived of in 1984, and the procurement of land near Fateh Jang began the same year. Land was bought for Rs30,000 per kanal to Rs500,000 per kanal, averaging Rs70,000 per kanal.

A stone-laying ceremony was held in 2004, and construction began without the approval of any design. Construction projects were also awarded at the same time to 17 contractors.

The initial Rs37bn PC-I was approved in 2008, which did not include the fuel system, radar and radio control building, aprons for planes, sewerage treatment plant, electricity or the availability of water.

In order to resolve the issue of water availability, it was decided to build two dams â Ramma and Kassana â at a cost of approximately Rs1.7bn to provide 3.3 million gallons of water per day.

In a statement, the paramilitary force called them attempts to defame the Rangersâ personnel, propagating fake news of raiding Loharâs house and arresting her brother Singhar Lohar.

It was alleged that a Rangersâ team raided her house and took away her 17-year-old brother. Soon after the alleged raid, a number of civil society and nationalist activists held a protest demonstration at Shaheed Chowk in Khipro town of Sanghar district.

The statement, however, added that VMPS representatives uploaded a âfakeâ video of the alleged raid on social media platforms on Jan 12, while the news also appeared on Jan 15. The paramilitary force said that the Rangers did not carry out any raid on Loharâs residence nor did any personnel harass her family.

As for the video circulated on social media, the Rangers said the mobile van seen in the footage was dispatched to Shumail Complex, near Mausamiyat [Karachi], on Jan 12 to arrest a suspect named Khalid Zaman.

",1/17/2019,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has urged the Sindh police to keep strict vigilance on peddling of narcotics in educational institutions.

âThis is a serious matter and must be handled seriously,â he said and added that whenever he met parents they urged him to take strict action against peddling of narcotics in educational institutions.

âI am quite concerned about our children, who are the future of Pakistan and we have to bring them up in a safe, secure and healthy atmosphere,â he said.

He also directed the education secretary to develop coordination between private educational institution administrations and the police and also involve parents in the matter, if necessary, to develop a mechanism to stop narcotics peddling in educational institutions.

âMost private security guards are untrained, which is dangerousâ

The chief minister, presiding over a weekly meeting on law and order here at the CM House on Wednesday, also directed the home secretary to issue instructions to all security companies to get verification of their guards.

âI want security audit of all the guards employed by security agencies,â he said and added that apart from verification of their personnel, their weapons must be inspected.

âI have noticed that most of the private security guards are untrained which is dangerous,â he said and highlighted the need for making police training centres more professional for the training of new recruits and in-service training.

He also referred to two upcoming important events â PSL and multinational âNaval AMANâ exercise â where the police had to provide security, therefore necessary meetings with the quarters concerned must be organised.

Operation against drug mafia

Earlier, DIG South Sharjeel Kharal told the chief minister that he had arrested a key suspect involved in developing a group to smuggle narcotics into educational institutions. IGP Kaleem Imam said that on the instructions of the chief minister the police had already launched a targeted operation against the drug mafia and had busted different gangs.

Explaining progress on implementation of the decisions taken in last weekâs meeting on law and order, the DIG said he had held meetings with the DHA authorities for the installation of more CCTV cameras and fixing the faulty ones. Street lights in the DHA and Clifton areas were being improved and upgraded, he added.

The IGP told the chief minister that the culprits of the Chinese consulate attack had been arrested. Additional IG of the CTD Dr Waliullah Dal and CTD DIG Abdullah Shaikh briefed the chief minister on busting a gang involved in making fake arms licences even of banned bores.

IGP Imam said that on the lead given by the arrested suspects (involved in making fake licences) their facilitators in the police department and DC offices had also been taken into custody.

Steps to curb street crime

DIG East Amir Farooqui and DIG West Amin Yousafzai briefed the chief minister on the steps taken by them to curb street crime.

The IG police said that he had created a special force of 10 to 20 well-trained policemen being stationed at the SSP offices so that they could be called in case of any eventuality. The first batch of the force had been posted in the South zone in the first phase and in the second phase this deployment would be made in other zones. This initiative has been made after the attack on the Chinese consulate when police force was called from different police stations.

The IGP told the chief minister that he was preparing a mechanism to start police recruitment round the year as âover 10,000 policemen retire from service every year, therefore recruitment process as approved by the chief minister was being startedâ.

The meeting was attended by Adviser on Law Murtaza Wahab, IGP Kaleem Imam, home secretary Kazi Kabir, AIG CTD Dr Waliullah Dal and Commissioner of Karachi Iftikhar Shallwani.

Business portal

Four provincial government departments signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to launch Sindh Business Registration Portal to help entrepreneurs complete all their registration procedure online.

The MoU was signed between the investment department of government of Sindh and SECP, labour department, industries and commerce department and Sessi.

Speaking to reporters after visiting production unit of an automobile company at Port Qasim, the federal minister was confident about the change in Sindh and âbleakâ political future of the PPP in the province.

âThe future of PPP in Sindh is no different from Pakistan Muslim League-Nâs in Punjab,â he replied to a question.

âThe MQM is our key partner and for development of Karachi we both would devise a joint strategy.

",1/17/2019,"KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Wednesday spoke on the issues afflicting Sindh because of persistent water shortages as the provincial assembly passed a motion asking the Sindh government to approach the Centre for judicious water distribution among all federating units.

An extensive debate was held during the Sindh Assembly session, chaired by Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani, on an adjournment motion moved by Pakistan Peoples Partyâs Heer Soho to discuss the role of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) in distributing water among the provinces in the light of the 1991 Accord â an agreement signed by then chief minister Jam Sadiq Ali.

A number of members of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which rules Islamabad, were present in the house, but they opted not to participate in the debate.

Murad Ali Shah questions PTI lawmakersâ sincerity with Sindh

No participation from PTI in debate

Chief Minister Shah did not hide his anguish on the silence of the PTI members who sat idle while everyone else spoke and expressed their anger against Irsaâs attitude towards Sindh.

âNot a single member of a big political party took part in this debate, which reflects how sincere they are with Sindh,â said a displeased Shah. âThey should have spoken here; no matter against or for our stance. But, they vanished from the scene on such an important issue for Sindh.â

He also indicated the absence of the parliamentary party leader of the PTI who spoke extensively earlier during a calling-attention notice, but preferred not to be in the house today.

Mr Shah gave a detailed background about the water woes of Sindh, which, according to him originally begin in 1859. He said it was not just the Indus, but Sindh would get water from five other rivers as well.

He said the colonial rulers rejected the Greater Thal Canal scheme twice; yet, it was constructed during a dictatorâs regime.

Despite British rulersâ actions against Sindh, he added, they chalked out and enforced an agreement after the construction of the Sukkur Barrage in which Sindhâs share was 48.74 million acre feet, which was still greater than Punjabâs 48.33MAF share then.

He said everyone had technically approved that agreement. However, after Partition, India stopped water to the then western wing of Pakistan forcing the newly created state to get its water by payment to India.

He said no expert was taken from Sindh and all of them belonged to the neighbouring province when Pakistan signed the Indus Basin Water Treaty in September 1960 and âsoldâ three of its rivers to India.

Too little water released downstream Kotri

âSuch a treaty soon created problems; then, those at the helm decided why just Sindh take benefit from Indus and dams were constructed on the river. That was the time when problems for Sindh in getting its share of water got worse.â

He said instead of minimum 10MAF, just 2MAF water was allowed downstream Kotri this season. âDo you want to make the people of the lower riparian die of hunger and thirst?â

Mr Shah said even the 1991 Accord promised a separate share of water for Karachi, yet it was not being given.

He said Sindh was the province whose share was negligibly increased in contrast to Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan in the 1991 Accord. However, that share was never given to the province, he added.

He appreciated Balochistan for supporting Sindhâs case, saying he had contacted the chief ministers of Punjab and KP requesting them to help Sindh in getting justice.

Mr Shah said upon his efforts, the Council of Common Interests had formed a committee to resolve the water issue. The committee had met twice and its report was still awaited, he said.

He said Sindh was concentrating on the theme of conservation of water by lining the canals to make best use of the water available to the province.

Kalabagh dam termed a dead horse

He said there was a deficit of trust regarding the issue of the Kalabagh dam and appreciated an opposition member for highlighting conspiracies to give a new lease of life to the âdead horseâ as the project was generally termed.

Ms Soho said Sindh was enduring agonising water shortages for years while the federal government was not ready to discuss the issue with the provincial government.

She accused Irsa of not making judicious distribution of water and demanded that the existing Irsa committee be dissolved and the federal nominee on the authority be taken from Sindh for being lower riparian in the new set-up.

Grand Democratic Allianceâs Nand Kumar said instead of passing resolutions and motions the government should evolve a mechanism, which can ensure that the issue gets resolved.

He said he smelled a conspiracy behind creation of water problems with Sindh by which âthey try to revive the dead horse. But, I make it clear here that weâll not allow you to construct the Kalabagh damâ.

PPPâs Aziz Narejo said shortage of water was 50 per cent at Sindhâs barrages, which multiplied miserably as water flowed downstream.

GDAâs Nusrat Sehar Abbasi said Sindh had not presented its case effectively. She echoed her colleague that conspiracies were on to revive the Kalabagh dam.

Muttahida Majlis-i-Amalâs Abdul Rasheed said instead of resolving such important issues, federal ministers were visiting Sindh only for engineering the provincial governmentâs collapse.

Mohammad Qasim of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan said: âIt is not failure, but it is planned ignorance and hooliganism on the part of Irsa for not giving Sindhâs due share of waterâ.

Muttahida Qaumi Movementâs Jawed Hanif said Irsa distributed what it had in the system. He said it was time to stop wastage of water and make irrigation system efficient.

PPPâs Hina Dastagir said the federal government was taking measures to open gates for the Kalabagh dam. She said Punjab had never protested on the water issue because it had always benefited from the formula. She said Sindhâs deltaic region had been destroyed immensely.

Later, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Chawla tabled a motion in the house asking the provincial government to approach the Centre for getting Irsa to fairly regulate water distribution among the provinces.

",1/17/2019,"RAWALPINDI: ExpressÂ­ing concern over the presence of a large number of Afghans living in Pakistan, the government has directed the law enforcement agencies to ensure strict vigilance and security till the repatriation process is completed.

The issue of Afghans living in Pakistan and their repatriation was discussed at a meeting held in Islamabad recently. Senior officials of the federal government and intelligence agencies attended the meeting.

The meeting was informed that the presence of a large number of Afghans (registered and unregistered) in Pakistan was a point of concern for law enforcement agencies. The officials were of the view that although the number of unregistered refugees was collated by the police through FIRs registered, there was a need to chalk out a comprehensive strategy at the national level for their repatriation.

Officials say there are many unregistered Afghans who have obtained Pakistani identity documents using illegal means

It was also pointed out that majority of the Afghan settlers were not willing to return and so a clear-cut policy might be devised for their early repatriation. The law enforcement agencies officials said that there was an urgent need to develop a mechanism for re-verification of Afghan refugees through biometric systems as 32 per cent of them were living in camps but the remaining 68pc were living outside camps.

The intelligence officials said that there were many unregistered Afghans who had settled in Pakistan and obtained Pakistani identity documents using illegal means. They suggested that till completion of the repatriation, the security around the refugees must be ensured to avoid any untoward incident.

The meeting asked the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions to share data of the total number of Afghans living in Pakistan and directed law enforcement agencies to ensure strict vigilance and security till the completion of the process.

Meanwhile, the Punjab government recently chalked out standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the security of foreigners, especially Chinese.

It was observed by the law enforcement agencies that foreigners were visiting sensitive locations without acquiring no objection certificate (NOC) from intelligence agencies concerned and provincial and district governments.

The fresh guideline was given to all divisional police chiefs and commissioners and suggested that all foreigners shall report their depÂ­arture and arrival details.

In line with the fresh SOP, computerised database and biometric record of each foreigner living or working in the area of jurisdiction of police will be maintained and the record will be tallied with the Federal Investigation Agencyâs records.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had produced Mr Rafique before the court of Justice Muhammad Bashir, seeking transit remand for five days.

When asked for how many days the National Assembly session would last, the court was informed that the session might continue for over five days and so it was likely that the court would be requested to extend the transit remand further. The court approved the request.

It is worth mentioning that Mr Rafique â who is in NABâs custody in the Paragon Housing scam case â was shifted from Lahore to Islamabad last week as his production orders were issued by the National Assembly speaker.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Rafique said that whether under martial law or civil government, the term accountability was used but it was never genuinely implemented in the country. He suggested that the system of accountability should be revamped.

Replying to a question, he said that credit for the alliance of opposition parties went to Prime Minister Imran Khanâs âchildishâ approach.

âThe government is non-serious and it cannot run the country. The coalition of opposition parties is the need of the hour as a joint opposition would be able to give tough time and force the government to perform,â he said.

",1/17/2019,"ISLAMABAD: A special committee constituted by the Supreme Court in the case involving death of 10-year-old Amal Umer in Karachi has recommended that police personnel engaged in patrolling to control street crimes should not carry sub-machine guns (SMGs), rather pistols or handguns.

Read: How the system failed us

A three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had formed the committee under the chairmanship of a retired superior court judge, Justice Khilji Arif Hussain, and assigned it the task of identifying negligence on the part of police and private hospitals in dealing with emergency situations and suggest reforms after it had taken notice of the incident in which Amal died after being hit during an exchange of gunfire between police and robbers in Karachi.

Take a look: A crime unpunished

In its report submitted to the court on Wednesday, the committee pointed out that Karachi had in recent past gone through a law and order crisis, which had resulted in the killing of many innocent citizens and members of law enforcement agencies. Though the situation had now improved considerably on the sectarian and ethnic fronts, the challenge posed by street crimes had grown serious and was resulting in the loss of human lives and valuables almost on a daily basis.

Personnel should be trained to use appropriate force in tricky situations, says its report

It appeared that police had not prepared for the transitory phase and were still in the mode of fighting terrorism, said the report.

The committee recommended that SMGs should be authorised for use only in sensitive areas of Karachi, including some parts of South Zone (Lyari) and West Zone, in proportion to the threats posed.

The squads deputed to protect police officers, judges and ministers should carry only one SMG per vehicle and the remaining policemen should be armed with pistols, said the report. There is a specialised unit, namely the Rapid Response Force, which should be available and duty-bound for dealing with high-risk situations, which involve the use of heavy arms and ammunition.

The committee said that police personnel lacked training, adding that Karachi was highly urbanised and in the event of a police encounter a highly trained force was required. But it has been observed that police officers do not take refresher courses and/or conduct firing practice regularly.

As a result, they end up causing collateral damage, in the shape of loss of lives of innocent citizens. Therefore, there must be a mandatory requirement of refresher courses on a regular basis (at least after every six months). The committee pointed out that training with regard to urban policing was also required. The personnel should be able to assess the appropriate amount of force that should be used in a situation. The culture of carrying out encounters should be discouraged.

The personnel should also be trained to use measures other than using arms and ammunition wherever possible. Training to take calculated and proportionate decisions was pertinent, especially in urban policing, said the committeeâs report.

The committee noted that police stations were still maintaining a manual system for recording arms and ammunition, which could be manipulated in case of a serious incident. Therefore, the inventories of arms and ammunition at the headquarters and police stations should be computerised and biometric machines should be installed to make the officials accountable.

The IBS facility should be used to identify the weapons and ammunition that are given to the personnel. In this way the weapon that is issued could be easily traced whenever it is fired or goes missing.

Weapon recognition should be coordinated with the biometrics to keep a complete check on who the weapon was allotted to, how much ammunition was used, etc.

The committee also highlighted the poor management of the operational and investigation branches of police. The additional SHO concerned was involved in misappropriation of recovered amount from the culprits. The official who had prepared the recovery memo was guilty of corruption and should be awarded severe punishment, it said.

The investigation officers failed to arrest the co-accused for a very long time, even though he could have easily been traced out earlier. The investigation branch required refresher courses and better supervision of senior officers in such cases.

A comprehensive strategy was required to implement the Smart City Project in Karachi. Unfortunately for a city of 22 million people, only 2,300 cameras were operational in the city and police had to rely on private CCTV footages, said the committee. The cameras available often produced footage of poor quality.

It was high time the project was implemented in the light of existing Supreme Court orders, said the committee. âIt is recommended that the legislature enact (if need be) and/or the Sindh government enforces a mandatory requirement wherein all commercial entities have to install cameras on all outside corners of their shops, establishment, building, etc, at their cost of installation, running and maintenance,â read its report.

Cameras in residential areas should be the responsibility of the Sindh government and lack of this facility should attract penal provisions such as a fine on the owner/owners, the committee added.

",1/17/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua has said that the scope of activities for international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) has been defined in accordance with the nationâs requirements.

Speaking to foreign envoys on the issue of INGOs registration, she said âactivities that are responsive to Pakistanâs national development prioritiesâ had been identified.

The sectors in which INGOs are being encouraged to work are poverty alleviation, health, vocational education and training, science and technology, environmental protection, disaster management, sports and culture.

The government had started fresh registration of INGOs in 2015 after announcement of the registration policy. A total of 141 INGOs had applied for registration under the new policy, out of which applications of 74 were approved, while those of 41 were rejected.

Since the scope of activities was also restricted, some of the organizations, particularly those working on issues like democracy, governance, rule of law and security opted to close down.

The policy was criticised by donor countries as restrictive and non-transparent.

Defending the policy, Ms Janjua said the decisions on cancellation of registration and closure were in full accord with the standards of due process and that the right of appeal and opportunities to discuss mutual concerns were provided to the INGOs.

She recalled that 74 INGOs were still operational in the country.

The foreign secretary, however, reaffirmed the governmentâs commitment to a âmutually beneficial framework on INGOs, underpinned by rule of law, transparency and responsive to nationally determined development prioritiesâ.

She further noted that the policy framework was âguided by Pakistanâs national context, circumstances, needs and prioritiesâ.

It was agreed that the envoys of donor countries would remain engaged with the government for exploring options for addressing concerns of the INGO sector.

Donor countries have insisted that the new policy would affect Pakistanâs image as âa partner on human developmentâ. They have, therefore, been demanding a âmore cooperative and nuanced arrangement on INGOsâ.

",1/17/2019,"KARACHI: In less than six months of its existence, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government seems to be moving towards being mired in numbers game as one of its key supporters in the parliament, the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), has hinted at parting ways with the ruling party while complaining of its ânon-seriousnessâ over the points both sides agreed when their partnership began.

Though BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal assured that no anti-government move would come from his party, he sounded impressed with the fresh political development in the country when the opposition parties agreed on formation of a committee to finalise a joint strategy to give tough time to the government, saying such moves âalways bring political stability in Pakistan.â

âLet me make it very clear that we are not part of the government,â he said while responding to questions by reporters outside his DHA residence before a meeting of his partyâs central executive committee. âWe have provided them support while sitting on independent benches. We support their every positive move and oppose negative ones. But the fact is that we have not witnessed seriousness at the governmentâs end over our agreed points, which convinces us to review our strategy.â

PTI is non-serious over mutually agreed agenda, says Mengal

Sharing his experiences with the PTI government and Prime Minister Imran Khan, Mr Mengal said that after every meeting between the two sides, a committee was formed âfor nothing,â which only suggested another meeting leaving the real issues stagnant at the same level where they were some six months ago.

âWe agreed on the six-point agenda at the time of the presidential elections and earlier after the general elections we developed consensus on nine points. But unfortunately, not one of these points has been taken up. I think there is sheer lack of seriousness [on part of the PTI] and unfortunately thereâs no change in its attitude despite several reminders,â the BNP-M leader said.

Days after the PTI secured majority in the July 25 elections, it reached an agreement with the BNP-M and the two parties signed a six-point memorandum of understanding (MoU) after a marathon session between Mr Mengal and Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Under the MoU signed by Mr Mengal and Mr Qureshi, the BNP-M â having four seats in the National Assembly â had supported the PTI candidates for the office of prime minister and speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly.

However, cracks started emerging in the parliamentary partnership within a couple of months and Mr Mengal on record warned the PTI leadership that his party could withdraw its support for the federal government if the ruling party continued ignoring it while taking decisions about Balochistan. The warning, it appears, has now turned into action from Mr Mengal who is mulling it over before making a key decision about his partyâs future strategy in the parliament while acknowledging the alliance of the opposition parties.

âWe are not going to make any move against the government and if they review their strategy we would continue to support it,â he replied to a question about possible role of his party, after withdrawing support for the government, in the opposition alliance that had emerged recently. âThe meeting of [Pakistan Peoplesâ Party leader] Asif Zardari and [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz chief] Shahbaz Sharif is a good omen. The political forces always move together for strong democracy despite differences. I think it would bring political stability in the country.â

The PPP and the PML-N were reportedly forming an alliance in order to give 'tough time' to the incumbent government.

In wake of the rising tension between the government and the major opposition parties, the PTIâs coalition partners were pushing the ruling party to fulfil the promises made at the time of forming the coalition.

The MQM delegation talked about the challenges faced by people living in the megacities in Sindh. The premier responded by saying that he was aware of aware of the challenges faced by the people of Sindh. ""The federal government will play its role to resolve these problems,"" he said.

It was decided during the meeting that a committee will be constituted under the chairmanship of Sindh Governor Imran Ismail to strengthen the coordination between the two parties in connection with development projects on the provincial level.

The two sides also decided that obstacles in the restoration of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) will be removed on a priority basis. It was also decided that the premier will lay the foundation stone of a university in Hyderabad.

Besides the Minister for Information Technology Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Minister for Law and Justice Dr Farogh Naseem and MNA Syed Ameenul Haq, the meeting was also attended by Minister for Finance Asad Umar, Special Assistant to PM Naeemul Haq and MNA Malik Mohammad Amir Dogar.

On Monday, Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) leader Sanaullah Baloch said his party had decided to review its relations with the ruling PTI government in Islamabad following the by-election on a Senate seat in Balochistan.

On Tuesday, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry visited the temporary headquarters of the MQM in Bahadurabad, where he discussed implementation on several decisions made between the two coalition partners a few months ago.

On the occasion, the federal minister had brushed aside the impression of any dispute or disagreement between the two sides. The minister had told reporters, âIn todayâs meeting, we have discussed and reviewed the memorandum of understanding which we signed at the time of formation of the government. Several points of the MoU have already been executed while others will also meet the same fate soon.â

Earlier in the same meeting, MQM's deputy convener Kanwar Naveed Jameel reminded the federal minister of promises of funds from the Centre for a public university in Hyderabad and other development schemes in urban Sindh.",Sanaullah Khan,Dawn,Politics,"MQM-P, PTI, Imran Khan, coalition government, opposition",1,"['muttahida', 'qaumi', 'movement', 'pakistan', 'mqmp', 'delegation', 'wednesday', 'called', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'pm', 'house', 'islamabad', 'discuss', 'issues', 'pertaining', 'coalition', 'centre', 'meeting', 'came', 'backdrop', 'rising', 'tensions', 'ptiled', 'coalition', 'government', 'opposition', 'ppp', 'pmln', 'reportedly', 'forming', 'alliance', 'order', 'give', 'tough', 'time', 'incumbent', 'government', 'wake', 'rising', 'tension', 'government', 'major', 'opposition', 'parties', 'ptias', 'coalition', 'partners', 'pushing', 'ruling', 'party', 'fulfil', 'promises', 'made', 'time', 'forming', 'coalition', 'mqm', 'delegation', 'talked', 'challenges', 'faced', 'people', 'living', 'megacities', 'sindh', 'premier', 'responded', 'saying', 'aware', 'aware', 'challenges', 'faced', 'people', 'sindh', 'federal', 'government', 'play', 'role', 'resolve', 'problems', 'said', 'decided', 'meeting', 'committee', 'constituted', 'chairmanship', 'sindh', 'governor', 'imran', 'ismail', 'strengthen', 'coordination', 'two', 'parties', 'connection', 'development', 'projects', 'provincial', 'level', 'two', 'sides', 'also', 'decided', 'obstacles', 'restoration', 'karachi', 'circular', 'railway', 'kcr', 'removed', 'priority', 'basis', 'also', 'decided', 'premier', 'lay', 'foundation', 'stone', 'university', 'hyderabad', 'besides', 'minister', 'information', 'technology', 'khalid', 'maqbool', 'siddiqui', 'minister', 'law', 'justice', 'dr', 'farogh', 'naseem', 'mna', 'syed', 'ameenul', 'haq', 'meeting', 'also', 'attended', 'minister', 'finance', 'asad', 'umar', 'special', 'assistant', 'pm', 'naeemul', 'haq', 'mna', 'malik', 'mohammad', 'amir', 'dogar', 'monday', 'balochistan', 'national', 'party', 'bnpmengal', 'leader', 'sanaullah', 'baloch', 'said', 'party', 'decided', 'review', 'relations', 'ruling', 'pti', 'government', 'islamabad', 'following', 'byelection', 'senate', 'seat', 'balochistan', 'tuesday', 'information', 'minister', 'fawad', 'chaudhry', 'visited', 'temporary', 'headquarters', 'mqm', 'bahadurabad', 'discussed', 'implementation', 'several', 'decisions', 'made', 'two', 'coalition', 'partners', 'months', 'ago', 'occasion', 'federal', 'minister', 'brushed', 'aside', 'impression', 'dispute', 'disagreement', 'two', 'sides', 'minister', 'told', 'reporters', 'todayas', 'meeting', 'discussed', 'reviewed', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'signed', 'time', 'formation', 'government', 'several', 'points', 'mou', 'already', 'executed', 'others', 'also', 'meet', 'fate', 'soona', 'earlier', 'meeting', 'mqm', 'deputy', 'convener', 'kanwar', 'naveed', 'jameel', 'reminded', 'federal', 'minister', 'promises', 'funds', 'centre', 'public', 'university', 'hyderabad', 'development', 'schemes', 'urban', 'sindh']"
31,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457907/ihc-did-not-adhere-to-sc-guidelines-about-bail-judgements-while-deciding-sharifs-petitions,"'IHC did not adhere to SC guidelines about bail judgements while deciding Sharifs' petitions'
",1/16/2019,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued its detailed judgement regarding the rejection of a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) appeal against the Islamabad High Court decision to suspend the prison sentences awarded to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in the Avenfield corruption reference.

A five-member larger bench of the SC had on Monday thrown out the accountability watchdog's appeal challenging the September 19, 2018, IHC order under which Sharif, his daughter and son-in-law retired captain Mohammad Safdar were granted bail after suspension of their jail terms.

The five-page SC written judgement, penned by Chief Justice-designate Asif Saeed Khosa, while detailing the reasons for dismissal of NAB's appeal has pointed out several flaws in the IHC judgement for suspension of the Sharifs' sentences.

The verdict notes that ""instead of adhering to the guidelines issued and recommendations made"" by the SC in an earlier case regarding shorter formats of orders to be passed in matters of bail, the high court had issued a 41-page judgement while deciding the Sharif's bail petitions.

According to the judgement, it is a settled principle of law that while deciding an application for bail or the suspension of sentence, the merits of the case are not commented upon in detail. However, the IHC in its impugned judgement ""had not only undertaken a detailed assessment of the merits of the case but had also recorded some categorical conclusions regarding the same"".

Besides, the Sharifs' writ petitions for suspension of their sentences were taken up at a time when their main appeals challenging the accountability court's verdict in the Avenfield case had already been fixed for hearing. This is in contrast to judicial norms, the judgement said, because sentences are usually suspended considering that a convict ""may not be kept in custody till his appeal is fixed for hearing"".

Citing previous cases, the written verdict says that the SC has clarified that in cases under the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 a high court may exercise its constitutional jurisdiction to grant bail ""only in extraordinary circumstances and in cases of extreme hardship"". But in the cases concerning the Sharifs, ""no such extraordinary circumstance or hardship had been referred to"" by the IHC in its judgement.

Additionally, the judgement says that by adverting to some deficiencies in the evidence that led to the Sharif's conviction under Section 9(a)(v) of NAO 1999, the high court had failed to consider that conclusions in that regard at the bail stage were ""premature"" as additional evidence could have been adduced or procured during the pendency of their appeals.

""Despite the above-mentioned deficiencies found by us in the impugned judgments,"" the verdict reads, ""we are cognisant of the legal position that considerations for grant of bail and those for its cancellation are entirely different"".

Detailing reasons for the dismissal of NAB's appeal, the SC judgement noted that the bureau had not levelled any allegations of misuse or abuse of the concession of bail by the Sharifs.

In addition, one of the three respondents (Nawaz Sharif) is already in jail after being convicted in another case; a second respondent (Maryam) is a woman and ""the law envisages concession for her in the matter of bail""; and the prison sentenced awarded by the trial court to the third respondent (Safdar) was quite short.

In these ""peculiar circumstances"", the SC bench did not feel persuaded to interfere with the jurisdiction exercised by the IHC in deciding the bail applications. NAB's appeal was thus dismissed.

On July 6, 2018, Judge Mohammad Bashir of the accountability court while deciding the Avenfield apartments reference had awarded 10-year imprisonment to Nawaz Sharif, seven years to his daughter Maryam and one year to his son-in-law Safdar.

Two months later, a division bench of the IHC had accepted their petitions seeking suspension of the sentence and set them free on Sept 19.

",1/16/2019,"The KP government has just approved plans of building a Rs42 million youth centre for women in Peshawar. The new facility in Hayatabad will include a gym, yoga classes, a modern theatre, a rooftop cafÃ©, a children's play area and different game rooms.

Photos of the approval meeting were tweeted out yesterday by the tourism minister Mohammad Atif Khan who formally approved the budget in the presence of members of the KP Youth Development Commission, which is the think-tank responsible for planning the facility.

A youth centre, even a segregated one, can be a step towards more pronounced participation by women in Peshawar's public life. However, many noticed that women were ostensibly missing from the meeting, calling them to question if any were even consulted during the planning phase?

However, according to Asfandyar Khattak, Director Youth Affairs KP, the planning of the youth centre was undertaken by an all-women committee consisting of five female professionals. He explained that no women are seen in the photo because the female members were on the visit of the place finalised for the centre, and joined the meeting later. He added that the centre will be operational within three months and it remain open from 8am to 10pm.

Mr Khattak's clarification is a relief, for the apparent exclusion of women raises concerns about whether the centre's plans were informed by what men think women need rather than what women are given the space to demand?

An all-male meeting minimises the value of women's insight and representation and underscores a troubling trend â like often in the home, it's up to men to decide what privileges a woman can enjoy.

",1/16/2019,"Did you hear? Premiere Imran Khan was just gifted a gold-plated Kalashnikov with bullets by the Governor of Saudi Arabiaâs Tabuk province, Prince Fahad bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz.

What use is this to IK?... We're not sure yet - but he seems extremely happy to be receiving it.

However, we're at odds with this choice of present and feel the PM could've been given a more 'thoughtful' gift, because really, Imran Khan is a man of simple taste.

Here're 5 things we feel would've been best suited for the PM. For starters...

1) A new set of clothes

It's a known fact that Imran Khan refuses to buy new clothes and since all his clothes are worn out, like IK's wife Bushra Maneka says they are, a few shalwar kameez and suits would've been a sweet gift. #NewYearNewMe

2) A gold replica of the '92 World Cup trophy

Let's be real, Imran Khan's 1992 World Cup win is something Insaafiyans cannot stop bragging about - and neither can he. Ask any PTI supporter why IK is best suited for his role as PM and they'll argue that he won us the World Cup... in the early 90s... which really isn't the same as running the country BUT it's still a win and this way at least Imran gets to brag about it while also showing it off in gold!

3) A free lifetime supply of Al Baik chicken

We all have our favourites, Nawaz loves paye, Imran loves chicken, what better way to win the PM's heart than a free lifetime supply of broasted chicken from the one restaurant Saudi Arabia is known for?

4) A set of gold dumbbells

The Prime Minister loves to exercise, we know because he's shown us, over and over and over again. A pair of gold dumbbells would've proved to IK that he's really, truly cared for.

5) More money for the dam fund

Nothing speaks volumes of love (for IK) than donating money towards his dam fund. Although the KSA has already donated Rs62 million towards it, it would've made up for the remaining population of our country that lives below poverty line - also not every expat can afford to donate $1000 or every Pakistani, Rs10.

A notification dated Jan 15 issued by the Cabinet Division states that Gondal's appointment ""shall be in honorary capacity"" and with immediate effect.

Gondal, a former PPP leader and a political heavyweight, had joined the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf last year. He was appointed as the prime minister's official spokesperson yesterday â a move that came as a surprise because he is a newcomer to the party and there are several senior PTI leaders who could have been considered potentials for the slot but were not.

The prime minister's hefty media team already comprised Iftikhar Durrani, the PMâs Special Assistant on Media with the status of a minister of state; Yousuf Baig Mirza, the PMâs Special Assistant on Media Affairs; Muhammad Sarfaraz, a deputy secretary and head of the PMâs official media cell; and Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, the government spokesman.

However, despite the presence of these heavyweights, prime minister Khan has in the past tended not to rely on them and expressed his views directly through tweets.

A source in the Prime Minister's Office said that Gondal would be working as the premier's spokesman on an honorary basis without a salary or other perks.

Gondal, also known as Nadeem Afzal Chan, joined the PTI in April last year, shortly before the July 25 general elections.

Before this, he was counted as one of the main leaders of the PPP in Punjab and was fairly vocal in the media in defending the policies of his party, presently in opposition.

He served as the chairman of the National Assemblyâs Public Accounts Committee for nearly a year, from April 25, 2012, to March 16, 2013.

",1/16/2019,"The Lahore High Court on Wednesday gave Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz one-time permission to leave the country for a period of 10 days.

Hamza along with his father Shahbaz Sharif and brother Salman Shahbaz is facing multiple National Accountability Bureau (NAB) inquiries, including those into Ramzan Sugar Mills road construction and assets beyond means.

The MPA had on Tuesday petitioned the court through Advocate Azam Nazir Tarar that the interior ministry had placed his name on the exit control list arbitrarily as no opportunity of hearing had been afforded to him before the impugned action.

The opposition leader had stated that he on Nov 27, 2018, intended to travel abroad to see his ailing wife, undergoing medical treatment in the United Kingdom. However, he said, he was informed by the authorities that his name had been included in the list on NAB's advice.

He pleaded that the right to travel and free movement was guaranteed under the Constitution, however, the impugned memorandum issued by the interior ministry was in utter violation of his fundamental rights.

The MPA contended that a bare perusal of the ministryâs memorandum showed that it had been issued in an unfair exercise of executive powers and failed to give any valid reason. He further pleaded that the act of placing his name on the ECL was in violation of Articles 2-A, 4, 9, 15, and 25 of the Constitution.

The petitioner asked the court to set aside the impugned memorandum for being unlawful and order the ministry to remove his name from the ECL. As an immediate relief, he urged the court to suspend the memorandum and grant him one-time permission to travel abroad till a final decision on the petition.

""I am the representative of the people of the largest province and have been taking regular part in all the NAB inquiries [against myself]. However, pending NAB cases have been made the reason for the inclusion of my name in the ECL,"" the petitioner argued.

Justice Muhammad Farrukh Irfan took up the petition in court today and allowed Hamza to leave the country once for a 10-day span.

""I belong to a political family and my name has been placed ECL dishonestly,"" he claimed.

""Does being a public representative mean that a person enjoys complete freedom?"" retorted Additional Attorney General Ashfaq A Khan, who represented the federal government in court.

""These courts are based on the premise that the law is equal for all citizens,"" Justice Irfan said.

The additional attorney general said that a high court judgement itself had laid down the rules for the restriction of movement for any citizen.

""If someone has caused monetary losses to the national exchequer they can be stopped from leaving the country,"" the advocate general told the court.

""Remember, those who are in the government today may be sitting in the opposition tomorrow,"" the judge said during the hearing, adding that the chief justice and SC judges are unhappy with the way NAB is conducting itself.

""Is the country going to be run by NAB? Should the courts and the parliament stop functioning?"" Justice Irfan wondered.

The interior ministry, passport and immigration personnel, and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) were made respondents in the petition, and the court issued the interior ministry a notice seeking its reply in the matter.

",1/16/2019,"WHAT was the impact of Chief Justice Saqib Nisarâs tenure on the fragility of Pakistanâs democracy? Justice Saqib Nisar challenged one of the foundational principles of democratic constitutional theory, according to which the judiciaryâs role in executive and legislative affairs is circumscribed. Under the leadership of a new chief justice, the Supreme Court should decide whether Justice Nisarâs brand of judicial activism should be maintained or abandoned.

The SCâs authority to review legislative and executive action to assess whether it is consistent with the Constitution is well established, but in traditional democratic constitutions, the judiciary restrains itself from playing a prominent role in executive and legislative affairs. Judicial overreach that undercuts the democratic branches is not approved.

Read more: Judicial independence is vital for democracy but judicial activism can be counterproductive

In new and fragile democracies, however, courts tend to exercise more influence over other branches of government, reflecting the recognition that these institutions may not have the capacity or willingness to enforce fundamental human rights and provide public services equitably and transparently. Article 199 and Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan give our superior judiciary the authority to make orders to enforce fundamental rights. Similar provisions exist in Indiaâs constitution.

Judicial intervention in politics should be judged on the basis of whether it promotes democratic governance.

The expanded role of the judiciary in new and fragile democracies of the Global South is visible in India, South Africa, Brazil and Colombia. In these jurisdictions, the role played by courts would, broadly speaking, not be countenanced in more mature Western democracies. In the contexts of newer democracies, the challenge posed by dysfunctional governance is one of the central concerns of the judiciary. This ethos is encapsulated in the words of a former chief justice of the Indian supreme court: âThe court has to innovate new methods and devise new strategies for the purpose of providing access to justice to large masses of people who are denied their basic human rights and to whom freedom and liberty have no meaning.â

While new and fragile democracies may present a better case for an expansive judicial role, these same contexts are also most vulnerable to the stifling effects of judicial overreach. Where the judiciary positions itself as a replacement of political branches of government, it runs the risk of stunting the growth of these institutions, and where the judiciary repeatedly shames the executive branch, it threatens to discredit democratic institutions.

In such circumstances, judicial activism may actually serve to promote the backsliding of fragile democracies towards authoritarianism, which is arguably what we have witnessed in Pakistan since the lead-up to the 2018 national elections.

How then should the courtâs role be defined in fragile democracies? Judicial intervention in political affairs should be judged on the basis of whether it promotes democratic governance. Judicial activism is justified if it strengthens civil society and promotes constitutional culture among the public at large. Conversely, judicial activism that has the effect of stunting democratic institutions must be rejected.

How does Justice Nisarâs brand of judicial activism fare against this standard? Justice Nisar took on significant public programme and policy initiatives that typically fall within the powers of the executive and legislature, most notably the Diamer Basha and Mohmand dam fund-raising campaign. Justice Nisar also displayed little faith in the ability of civilian bureaucracies to carry out their duties.

Read more: Pakistan hasnât succeeded in reforming its bureaucracy in the past. Can the PTI deliver?

Instead of leaving the investigation of certain high-profile cases to law-enforcement authorities, such as the police and the FIA, in their normal course of duty, Justice Nisar ordered the constitution of Joint Investigation Teams.

At the same time, his highly publicised visits to government hospitals where he berated officials for their incompetence reflected an impatience with civil bureaucracies. By taking notice of the quality of bottled water and exorbitant private school fees, the chief justice authoritatively stepped in to fill what he perceived to be gaps in private-sector regulation by the government.

Justice Nisar used his suo motu powers expansively and initiated cases on issues that he considered to be the pressing concerns of our time, such as water scarcity and high rates of population growth. In devising remedies, the voice of Justice Saqib Nisar was pre-eminent. Any role played by human rights activists, civil society groups or the affected public was largely muted.

The effect of Justice Nisarâs court has been perceived as undermining political institutions either by assuming the role and responsibility of political branches or by openly displaying contempt towards elected officials and civil bureaucrats. Justice Nisarâs interference with executive and legislative affairs exposed what many would consider the questionable side of judicial activism and its threat to the evolution of democracy.

How is the SC to avoid this effect while at the same time play its role in enforcing fundamental rights in matters of public importance, as envisaged in Article 184(3) of the Constitution? Public-interest litigation should be used as a means to expand democratic spaces rather than judicial promotion. Instead of aggressively using its suo motu powers, the superior judiciary should encourage cases initiated by affected citizens and civil society groups. Since new and fragile democracies such as Pakistan are plagued with non-transparency, the SC should use its constitutional mandate to fill this gap by devising remedies that create space for civil society to monitor government performance. The main goal of the SCâs exercise of judicial power should be to enhance citizen engagement and accountability.

After Justice Nisarâs retirement, the SC has the opportunity to reassess its constitutional role based on the principle that a more Â­modest exercise of power is conducive to Â­democratic growth. The SC can remedy government dysfunction by creating spaces for civil Â­society rather than using its judicial power to Â­overshadow political discourse.

",1/16/2019,"WITH Pakistan-India ties seemingly in a deep freeze, diplomats and consular staff of the two countries once again appear to have become victims of harassment and intimidation.

A 1992 agreement, a code of conduct that both countries agreed to for the treatment of diplomatic and consular personnel in India and Pakistan, is being tested after Pakistan protested the police detention of a Pakistani High Commission official in New Delhi, and India has countered with allegations of rough behaviour by Pakistani security personnel against senior Indian diplomats in Islamabad.

The latest accusations come less than a year since India and Pakistan once again decided to abide by the 1992 code of conduct, a re-commitment that became necessary after a spate of unsavoury incidents in New Delhi and Islamabad.

The fresh incidents should be dealt with quickly and appropriately in both New Delhi and Islamabad â whatever the difficulties in ties between the two states, diplomats must be allowed to continue with their work of representing their country and should not face intimidation and harassment.

Unhappily, some elements in both countries view normal diplomatic work with a great deal of suspicion and perhaps do not comprehend the risks of a diplomatic rupture between the two states.

The disruption to the lives of diplomats is just the latest indicator that a serious rethink of the state of Pakistan-India ties is needed in both countries.

The Pakistani leadership â both the civilian and military â has repeatedly stated its interest in dialogue on all issues with India, including terrorism, but the stubbornness of the Indian leadership has not made possible even preliminary talks about eventual dialogue.

Perhaps the Pakistani leadership can look towards specific offers and innovative ideas to draw the Indian leadership into a dialogue process.

Of course, if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government only see Pakistan as a useful rhetorical and political foil in the upcoming Indian general election, there may be nothing that the Pakistanis can do to try and break the impasse in bilateral relations.

Whatever the case, the tendency to target diplomats in India and Pakistan is an unwelcome practice that must immediately cease. The 1992 bilateral code of conduct has survived many ups and downs and acute tensions. It is a sensible agreement that ought to be upheld by India and Pakistan both in letter and spirit.

The hospital spokesman, Dr Wasim Khawaja, told Dawn: âThe step was taken in view of an alert issued for Punjab by the inspector general of the provincial police.â

All necessary measures mentioned in the standard operating procedure (SOP) have been adopted, Dr Khawaja said.

Under a high alert, duties of doctors and paramedical staff are assigned and their leaves are cancelled.

Besides, the availability of all necessary medicines as well as stock of blood are ensured and ambulances are put on a standby.

A senior police officer said high alert or red alert was declared on a threat alert issued either by the capital administration or the interior ministry. So far no such alert has been issued for the capital, he added.

âSecurity measures in the capital are already on a state of high alert since long,â said the officer.

But senior police officers have been asked to review the security measures for important public places.

Police pickets at the entrance of the capital were strengthened and personnel asked to keep an eye on suspects and suspicious vehicles.

The alert issued by the IGP stated that according to intelligence, four TTP militants were planning to conduct an attack on an intelligence setup in Lahore and anywhere in Punjab, said the police officer.

",1/16/2019,"A YEAR ago, the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud in Karachi sparked public outrage of an intensity that seemed impossible for the state to ignore.

Staged police encounters both in Sindh and elsewhere, especially Punjab, have gone virtually unchallenged over decades, claiming the lives of untold numbers of innocents, or at least of those not yet proven guilty. But this one caught the imagination of civil society. Perhaps it was because the story of the young man â no terrorist as alleged by the cops but an aspiring model â found its way on to social media where it echoed for weeks. Or maybe it was simply the straw that broke the camelâs back â one murder too many even in a country inured to state brutality, that too allegedly at the hands of âencounter specialistâ SSP Rao Anwar.

Dawn Investigation: Rao Anwar and the killing fields of Karachi

The event also proved a catalyst for festering resentments among a large segment of the population to coalesce into a movement for human rights. Nevertheless, one year on, the trial court has yet to indict the senior police official, who has since retired, or the other 25 suspects.

The facts of the case were, sadly, unexceptional. Four men, Naqeebullah among them, were abducted by cops in Karachiâs Malir district, taken to an abandoned farmhouse in the area and shot dead on Jan 13, 2018.

Take a look: Waiting for the next Naqeebullah

None of the victims, it subsequently emerged, even had a criminal record. A police inquiry committee found circumstantial evidence of Rao Anwarâs presence at the scene of the killings; a supplementary charge-sheet accused him and his subordinate cops of registering fake criminal cases, kidnapping, murder, and destroying evidence.

Also read: 'Naqeebullah Mehsud was innocent, was killed in a fake encounter,' says inquiry team

The case against the top police official could have been a turning point in the bloody saga of police brutality and extra-judicial killings that has long afflicted this country. However, what has transpired since makes a mockery of the criminal justice system; indeed, it displays a wicked disregard for the possibility of transitioning into a well-ordered society.

Rao Anwarâs demeanour in court, where he would arrive with full protocol and without handcuffs, was unmistakably that of a man secure in the knowledge that he was above the law â indeed, as unaccountable as those whose backing he allegedly enjoys.

The former SSP was confined for a few months to the comfort of his own home, conveniently declared a sub-jail on flimsy pretexts. Even that restriction was lifted last July when he was granted bail by an anti-terrorism court.

Selective application of âjusticeâ, an absence of due process, and the perversion of law enforcement into a vehicle of terror corrodes the very foundations of society, ensuring an unending cycle of violence.

The message that the lack of a trial thus far in the Naqeebullah case and the shocking indulgence shown to the prime suspect is that the police need fear no consequences for their actions against a hostage citizenry.

",1/16/2019,"IT has all the appearance of a well-intentioned attempt to square the circle between the youthâs need to find an occasion to express affection and joy (hardly an unseemly impulse) and the religious rightâs calls to ban anything it deems in opposition to our culture and values (an ever-widening basket of âoffencesâ).

And it may well be were it not for the fact that, beneath its benign surface, the alternative it offers betrays the selfsame posture of moral policing as its more strident diktats.

The announcement by a varsity in Faisalabad that it would observe Feb 14 as âSistersâ Dayâ might seem like a frivolous attempt at rebranding Valentineâs Day to give it a patina of ârespectabilityâ (the vice chancellorâs stated rationale was to turn a âthreatâ into an opportunity).

Yet the VC also said that the university was mulling plans to distribute scarves, shawls and gowns to its female students. Implicit in this is the suggestion that what Pakistanâs sisters truly need is not gender parity (or even so much as a token gesture of genuine esteem) â but to cover themselves up.

The Pakistani sisterhood might look at such a backhanded proposal with bemusement, and wonder at the neglect of the nationâs brothers for the lack of public interest in their behaviour and attire.

Objectifying womenâs bodies to counter purportedly Western perversions is surely an irony lost on our self-appointed gatekeepers of public decency.

Read more: The heart's filthy lesson

But it also speaks to a broader phenomenon in which, every year, state and private institutions alike descend into paroxysms of panic at the advent of Valentineâs Day. Legal, official or societal interventions to browbeat the public into abstaining from cheer demonstrate lack of restraint and respect for peopleâs right to choose.

And it is particularly sanctimonious juxtaposed with genuine, year-round social ills such as misogyny and gender-based violence (the antidote to which is not further maladjustment) conveniently ignored by those who would seek to proscribe all inter-gender interactions. Hopefully, this February, better sense will prevail.

",1/16/2019,"PESHAWAR: Deputy Commissioner Peshawar Dr Imran Hamid Shaikh on Tuesday banned the use of plastic shopping bags in megamalls and medical stores.

Through an executive order, the deputy commissioner set a deadline for them to dispose of their present stocks within seven and 15 days, respectively, according to a statement issued here.

Mr Shaikh has directed the megamalls to use biodegradable plastic bags while medical stores to use paper bags in the larger public interest.

âThe shopping bags mainly contribute to choking of drains, resulting in poor sanitation and water-borne diseases,â reads the order.

The order was issued in light of the provincial governmentâs instructions to the district administrations to take steps to stop usage of plastic bags in their respective districts.

Talking to Dawn, the deputy commissioner said in the first phase a ban had been imposed on the use of plastic bags in the shopping malls and medical stores. In the second phase, it would be applied on the grocery and fruit shops, he added.

Asked about any punishment over violation of the executive order, the DC said warnings would be issued to them after expiry of the deadlines.

After warning, he said, the available stocks of the shopping bags would be confiscated to be followed by the section 144 of the CrPC.

âI hope there would be no issue in the implementation of the ban as I have already consulted with the tradersâ community of the city,â he said.

",1/16/2019,"PESHAWAR: Afghan Ambassador Shukrullah Atif Mashal on Tuesday claimed that Kabul and Islamabad had agreed to work out a mechanism for swapping prisoners, who had either completed their prison terms or were granted bail but couldnât be freed due to certain reasons.

Addressing refugees here, the ambassador said the prisonersâ issue had come under discussion during a recent visit of foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to Kabul.

He said both sides had agreed on the exchange of prisoners.

Mr Mashal said the Afghan embassyâs team would visit various prisons in Pakistan for identification of prisoners.

âMany prisoners arrested in pity nature offences in the two countries should be released,â he said.

The ambassador said a 10-member team of Afghan government would visit prisons in Pakistan to find out prisoners, who had either completed their jail terms or were granted bails but couldnât be released.

Afghan ambassador says mechanism to be developed for swapping detainees, who have served jail terms or got bail

He said he would also inspect prisons.

Mr Mashal said the Afghan government would facilitate Pakistani officials to inspect jails in Afghanistan to identify Pakistani prisoners, who couldnât be freed due to some reasons.

The envoy, who assumed the charge in Islamabad around three weeks ago, didnât explain whether the deal will be applicable to prisoners detained on charges of subversive activities and other heinous crimes in the two countries.

Both countries have yet to sign extradition or prisoner exchange treaties.

Earlier, during a brief chat with media, the Afghan ambassador failed to come up with a reply when asked about media reports that Afghan Taliban leader Hafez Mohibullah has been detained in Peshawar.

He said efforts were under way for peace in Afghanistan.

âWe are here to work for peace in Afghanistan,â he said declining to comment on the detention of the Taliban leader.

The ambassador was very apprehensive about ill-treatment of Afghan nationals at the hands of Pakistani security personnel at Torkham border-crossing point and said the issue had been discussed with Pakistani Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

He said he would visit Torkham to review situation and would discuss the matter with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shah Farman and Corps Commander Shaheen Mazhar Mahmood today (Wednesday).

Mr Mashal said Afghan citizens coming to Pakistan were lined up at the entry gate for hours.

âWe donât need verbal promises. They (Pakistanis) should fulfil the promise of friendship, which they have been making,â he insisted.

The envoy said Pakistani authorities had promised to facilitate the entry of Afghan travelers at Torkham. He said he had proposed to make separate arrangements for women, elders and ambulance service at Torkham border to prevent mess and keep them from long wait.

Mr Mashal complained that every Afghan visa applicant was paying $200 outside Pakistani diplomatic mission in Kabul. He said the issue needed to be resolved.

The ambassador said officials of Pakistani missions in Kabul and Jalalabad were not involved in the illegal practice.

He said he had asked General Bajwa to increase the number of visas for Afghans and allow other consulates in Afghanistan to facilitate visa seekers.

Pakistani mission in Kabul issues 300 to 350 visas to Afghan nationals on a daily basis.

Mr Mashal expressed concern about the reports of the officials receiving bribes from Afghan truckers transporting goods under the Afghan Transit Trade.

He said âmalpracticesâ of the police and personnel of other law-enforcement agencies had a negative impact on the bilateral trade and therefore, Pakistani government should take measures for stopping illegal practices at checkposts.

The ambassador said he met Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and took up that issue with him as well.

He said Afghanistan wanted to increase the volume of trade with Pakistan. He asked Afghan and Pakistani traders to begin joint business ventures.

Mr Mashal said durable peace in Afghanistan was not only in the interest of Afghan nation but it would promote peace in the entire region.

He urged Pakistan and other neighbouring countries to play role for peace in his country.

âOn average, 100 to 150 people are killed in Afghanistan daily. How long this bloodshed will continue as millions of people will continue to live in Pakistan as refugees,â he said asking his countrymen to stop living life as refugees by returning as soon as possible.

",1/16/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Early marriages and the practice of feeding girls less than boys are key reasons for stunting in children, the country director of the Global Aliiance for Improved Nutrition said on Tuesday.

Dr Qaiser Munir Pasha was speaking at a seminar on Adolescent Nutrition in Pakistan: Identifying Opportunities and Setting Priorities, which was organised by the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS).

Take a look: Why do child stunting and maternal health feature so high on Prime Minister Imran Khan's priorities?

Boys are generally given more food than girls, he said, because of which girls are unable to compete with boys in many fields, and malnourished mothers cannot give birth to health babies.

âCurrently, 41pc of children do not go to school in Pakistan. The worst situation is in Balochistan, where only 20pc children go to school. There is need to ensure women and children are properly nourished because only that is how the mother and child mortality rate can be reduced,â he said.

Seminar on adolescent nutrition in Pakistan held

Dr Baseer Khan Achakzai, a health expert, said the first 1,000 days remain a critical period of nutritional need. Adolescence, the period between 10 and 19 years of age, is characterised by rapid biological and psychosocial growth and development. Up to 45pc of skeletal growth takes place and 15 to 25pc of adult height is achieved during adolescence.

âIt is a vulnerable time with increased nutritional requirements, particularly for girls who are biologically vulnerable, while often lacking access to nutritious food, education, and other opportunities owing to gendered cultural norms,â he said.

NHS ministry representative Dr Khawaja Masood said the establishment of a platform dedicated to adolescent nutrition, the National Technical Advisory and Advocacy Platform for Improved Adolescent Nutrition, was a landmark achievement.

âThis has not only served to bring together key partners in the adolescent nutrition space but will also anchor and drive further actions for adolescent nutrition in the country,â he said.

During the technical session, speakers explained that Pakistan has a high burden of malnutrition, costing $7.6 billion, or 3pc of the GDP, every year.

The evidence review suggested that adolescents experience a high burden of stunting, thinness, and being overweight. Girls appear to experience a higher burden of stunting (11-23pc) and being overweight/obesity (8pc) than boys (5pc for both).

Boys have a slightly higher prevalence of thinness (12pc) than girls (10pc).

Thinness is more common in rural areas and being overweight/obesity in urban areas. Anaemia is prevalent among adolescent girls (54pc) as well as deficiencies in folic acid (49pc), zinc (42pc) and vitamin A (40pc).

It was informed that household food insecurity is a major barrier to obtaining an adequate diet, especially in rural areas where more than half of households are food insecure.

The review further suggested that adolescent diets are generally poor, not sufficiently diverse, and are overwhelmingly of wheat and low in fruits, vegetables, pulses, potatoes, meat and eggs.

Adolescent girls rarely have control of food expenditure or distribution within the household; the primary decision makers for the purchase of packaged foods are their mothers, who have limited nutritional knowledge.

Although the age at first marriage is rising, one-third of women between 25 and 49 were married by 18, and 8pc of women between 20 and 24 gave birth by 18, increasing their risk of poor birth outcomes. Adolescents also have poor access to sexual and reproductive health care: only 13pc of adolescents between 15 and 19 use family planning services and 37pc of women between 15 and 49 receive at least four antenatal visits.

The committee witnessed removal of debris from the Mauj Darya shrine and completion of three temporary stairs at the shrine. However, it observed that construction of the retaining wall was yet to be launched due to paucity of funds. The team found tiles on the entrance to the shrine broken and the platform outside it required finishing. The team, however, appreciated the mosaic tile work at outer lawn of the Chauburji. The team observed that the gateway was yet to be converted into green belt despite availability of funds with the executing agencies.

On the occasion, the LDA officials told the committee that boundary wall, footpath and drain of both GPO and Supreme Court registry have been completed. However, the committee noticed that exhaust ducks boundary wall is yet to be completed.

The members found heaps in the Zaibun Nisa shrine. Similarly, according to them, red stone and fresco work of the tomb required finishing. Back side of the tomb needed some repair as there were some cracks in the tomb.

Earlier while visiting other sites, the committee members were told by the officials that the hydraulic tank of the Shalamar Gardens has been restored to its original position and the surrounding portion converted into green area. They also claimed that decorative motifs of Shalamar Gardens have been replicated on the train station of Shalamar Garden to create harmony.

However, the committee emphasised the need to conserve and protect the monuments like Shalamar Gardens strictly in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court. The committee also found maintenance of Buddu Ka Awa not up to the mark. However, it commended the efforts of conserving Gulabi Bagh Gateway.

The committee noticed appearance of cracks in Lakshmi building and directed the officials for strengthening the columns and filling of the cracks within the shortest possible time.

",1/16/2019,"LAHORE: Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz has approached the Lahore High Court for removal of his name from the Exit Control List (ECL).

Filed through Advocate Azam Nazir Tarar, Hamza stated in a writ petition that the interior ministry placed his name on the exit control list (ECL) in an arbitrary manner as no opportunity of hearing had been afforded to him before the impugned action.

The opposition leader stated that he on Nov 27, 2018, intended to travel abroad to see his ailing wife, undergoing medical treatment in the United Kingdom. However, he said, he was informed by the authorities that his name had been included in the list on the advice of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

Mr Hamza pleaded that the right to travel and free movement was guaranteed under the Constitution, however, the impugned memorandum issued by the interior ministry was in utter violation of his fundamental rights.

He contended that a bare perusal of the ministryâs memorandum showed that it had been issued in an unfair exercise of executive powers and failed to give any valid reason.

He further pleaded that the act of placing his name on the ECL was in violation of Articles 2-A, 4, 9, 15, and 25 of the Constitution.

The petitioner asked the court to set aside the impugned memorandum for being unlawful and order the ministry to remove his name from the ECL.

As an immediate relief, he urged the court to suspend the memorandum and grant him a one-time permission to travel abroad till the final decision of the petition.

Justice Farrukh Irfan Khan will take up the petition on Wednesday (today).

Hamza along with his father Shahbaz Sharif and brother Salman Shahbaz is facing multiple NAB inquiries, including those into Ramzan Sugar Mills road construction and assets beyond means.

",1/16/2019,"LAHORE: The provincial government on Tuesday informed the Lahore High Court that a special committee had been constituted to decide whether to allow celebration of Basant festival.

During the hearing of multiple petitions against the governmentâs plan to allow the kite flying, a law officer also told the court that no decision had been taken so far with respect to celebration of the Basant festival.

He said the committee formed by the government on the matter would submit its recommendation within two weeks.

Advocates Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, Sheraz Zaka and others had filed the petitions in public interest, pleading that the kite flying was a deadly sport and could not be allowed at the cost of citizensâ fundamental rights.

The petitioners also challenged the Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying Ordinance 2001 under which the government enjoyed discretionary powers to permit kite-flying activities.

They said the Supreme Court in its 2006 judgment had declared the kite-flying and celebration of basant festival a violation of the fundamental rights.

However, they said, the government introduced an amendment to the law, acquiring the power to allow kite-flying without defining any criteria.

The petitioners asked the court to restrain the government from allowing kite-flying or celebration of basant festival.

They further asked the court to declare null and void the section 4(1) and 4-B of the ordinance, which empowered the government to permit the kite-flying.

Justice Aminuddin Khan adjourned the hearing till Jan 24 for further arguments and also allowed the petitioners to implead the Kite Flying Association in the case.

",1/16/2019,"LAHORE: Former health minister Khwaja Salman Rafiq, who is under NAB custody, attended the Punjab Assembly session on Tuesday after Speaker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi issued his production orders, urging the National Assembly to amend NAB laws to protect basic human rights of all those arrested by it.

The treasury and opposition benches welcomed the [under-arrest] MPA and resolved to concertedly protect democracy in the country.

The speaker had issued the production orders before the start of the session under the assembly rules which were jointly amended for the purpose by a committee comprising members from both the treasury and opposition benches on Monday.

Kh Salman attends session after production order

Khwaja Salman was led to the house by his colleagues amidst slogans. He and former speaker Rana Iqbal thanked the speaker, deputy speaker and the law minister for allowing the facility which earlier missed in the rules.

Rules of the National Assembly and the assemblies of the other three provinces already allow speakers to issue production orders of members who are under arrest.

Mr Salman is in NAB custody along with his brother Khwaja Saad Rafique in connection with the Paragon City scam. He did not complain of any maltreatment by NAB during his captivity, and avoided to discuss the case against him saying it was sub judice and he believed courts would dispense justice.

He conceded that the NAB laws should have been changed in the past, and said the current National Assembly had already worked on the laws a great deal, and should now amend them. The PTI chairman (Imran Khan) should also be approached for the purpose, he said.

Salman said the parliament should revisit the NAB powers to obtain 90-day remand of the accused in any case. It should also check whether a poor government official could afford to pay high fees of lawyers to defend against [NAB] allegations.

Mentioning Nawaz Sharif, Shahbaz Sharif, Saad Rafique and others, he said the PML-N leadership was in jail. (Outside the assembly he said the PML-N was facing targeted accountability).

Salman said the PPP and the PML-N had undergone several tests (of hardship), and did not wish the same for the PTI. âWe should stop watching self-interest and start thinking of collectively,â he said. The parliamentarians should make a national road map and serve the nation.

The former minister said all political parties had sacrificed lives, mentioning his father, Saad Rafiq, Dr Nazir and Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi and others who were murdered. At this point Deputy Speaker Dost Mazari added the name of Nawab Akbar Bugti in the list of martyres, and welcomed Khwaja Salman in the house.

Rana Iqbal thanked the speaker, law minister and the treasury benches for amending the rules that allowed Salmanâs production. The deputy speaker termed the move a victory of the house.

Law Minister Raja Basharat said by amending the rules, the assembly acted independently. âLet us resolve to concertedly protect democracy and its institutions for all times to come,â he said.

PPPâs Parliamentary Leader Hasan Murtaza thanked the assembly and the government for taking a positive step. âSome people think that the unity of politicians would squeeze their space,â he said.

After the house was adjourned till Wednesday morning, Khwaja Salman called on the speaker in his chambers to pay his regards [for issuing the production orders]. The speaker had earlier told the media that he had issued the orders after consulting the prime minister the CM, the law minister and the entire house.

WHEAT STOCKS: Earlier, the speaker took exception to Food Minister Samiullahâs lack of knowledge about the rotting huge wheat stocks, fixing time for debate on the issue on Wednesday (today). âCheck the wheat policy and present it in the house at 2pm tomorrow (Jan 16),â he said after the law minister agreed on the debate.

The issue was agitated by PML-Nâs Malik Arshad who asked the government to clear its 2.2 million ton wheat stocks by selling it to people at subsidised rates or exporting it to get rid of the burden and create room for further procurements after two months.

Malik Kamran said the clearance of the stocks was necessary to protect the economic rights of wheat growers. âThe government is paying daily Rs 40 to 50 million to banks as interest for huge loans it had obtained for procuring wheat. It is better to sell the stocks to people at subsidized rates,â he said.

The minister said the government would not give any subsidy, and it would be able to clear the stocks anyways.

The deputy speaker, who soon replaced the speaker, referred an adjournment motion to the special committee for report in two months. The motion highlighted the attitude of the Benazir Bhutto Hospitalâs [Rawalpindi] medical superintendent with regard to Dr Areeba Abbasi, daughter of the jailed PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi.

The motion was moved by PML-Nâs Naseer Ahmad mentioning the victimisation of Dr Abbasi and putting on social media the telephone call of the law minister seeking some relief for the lady doctor after recording it.

The deputy speaker said the MS should have been suspended in the first place as âthis may happen to me, you or anyone else.â He ignored the pleas by Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid that there was no victimisation and action against the medical superintendent would be taken within a week.

RESOLUTIONS: The house adopted a resolution moved by PTIâs Momina Waheed asking the federal government to have the Constitution and the elections law amended to allow for the cancellation of the assembly membership of those who fail to take oath of their office three months after their election.

Adopting another resolution moved by PTIâs Seemabia Tahir, the house paid tributes to the army for destroying an Indian spy drone in the Bagh Sector after it crossed over the Line of Control. The action proved that the army was ready to counter any aggression by India and would use all its capabilities to protect every inch of Pakistan, the resolution said, praying for further successes of the army.

",1/16/2019,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was on Tuesday informed that the livestock and fisheries department had not been completely devolved to the province under the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.

Furnishing a statement during Question Hour in the assembly, Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Abdul Bari Pitafi said that the federal government had not fully devolved all functions and assets of the department to the province.

He said that these assets included the Korangi Fish Harbour, shrimp hatchery at Hawkesbay, livestock labs and other infrastructure.

Sindh has not been given control of Korangi Fish Harbour and shrimp hatchery at Hawkesbay

The minister further said that the provincial government had taken up the matter with the inter-provincial coordination ministry for devolving the assets to the province.

âA meeting was held on December 27, 2018 in which we sought sufficient funds from the federal pool for the provincial sector,â he added.

In reply to a question, asked by Khurram Sher Zaman of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, the minister said that the provincial livestock department was engaged with the federal government for the funds to be spent on development of fisheries.

Illegal nets

In reply to another question by Mr Zaman regarding unlawful fishing, Mr Pitafi said that the department was continuously combating against influential mafia in coastal brackish water area.

He said that more than 350 illegal nets were confiscated and cases were referred to the courts of law concerned. âAbout 120 illegal nets have been burnt after seeking the order from the honourable courtâ, he added.

The minister said that as far as the inland water was concerned regarding the illegal possession of influential people on any public water bodies, no written complaint was lodged by the bona fide fishermen in the fisheries department.

First biosafety level lab

Replying to other questions, he said that the countryâs first âBio-safety Level Laboratory and Quality Enhancement Cell for Highly Virus Vaccine Developmentâ was also being established in Karachi.

The livestock minister said that vaccines of bird flu and foot-and-mouth diseases (FMDs) of livestock would be produced in this laboratory.

He said that the scheme was initiated in 2013 with a cost of Rs 160.639 million and had to be completed by 2018. However, it suffered delays owing to âtypicalâ way of construction of such laboratories.

âThe civil work is 95 per cent completed and now just the equipment has to be installed. The laboratory would be functioning by this year,â the minister assured.

To another question asked by opposition member Nusrat Sehar Abbasi, he said that a project to control âSurraâ, an infectious disease among livestock, was initiated with the cost of Rs59.883m in arid and coastal zones at Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Sanghar, Khairpur and Jamshoro.

He said that the scheme was completed in June 2018.

To a supplementary question, he said medicine sufficient for 147,000 animals was imported and as many as 25,338 camels and horses were treated.

",1/16/2019,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday directed its monitoring wing, comprising teams identified as âmembers of inspection teamâ (MIT), to file a consolidated statement of rape cases pending in courts across the province till Jan 31.

A two-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar issued the directive during hearing of a petition filed by Kainat Soomro and two other rape victims seeking implementation of the Supreme Courtâs guidelines in rape cases and establishment of rape crisis cells at the district level.

At the outset of the hearing, the prosecutor general of Sindh contended that the police stations had already contacted the civil society organisations mentioned in the court order, adding that arrangements for DNA test was available at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) in Jamshoro and they had also inked a memorandum of understanding with the Karachi University for setting up a laboratory on the campus.

Order issued on plea to make rape casesâ investigation effective and DNA tests and preservation of DNA evidence mandatory

While putting off the matter till Jan 31, the bench directed the MIT-II to file a consolidated statement of pending rape cases in the province for further directions at the next hearing.

The petitioners were seeking implementation of a Supreme Court judgment (PLD 2013/107) about making investigation process of rape and assault cases effective and also sought directives for provincial government to make DNA tests and preservation of DNA evidence mandatory in rape cases.

They maintained that the SC had directed the provincial government and other authorities to reform the investigation process of rape cases, but the directions of the apex court were not being complied with, adding that rape victims were unable to get justice due to faulty process of investigation.

While impleading the Sindh health secretary, provincial police chief and others as respondents, the petitioners pleaded to direct them to take immediate steps to improve the investigation system and establish rape crisis cell in each district of the province to help victims in acquiring immediate medical, financial and legal assistance.

They also asserted that the Supreme Courtâs guidelines for police investigation officers, medico-legal officers, trial courts should be implemented in letter and spirit.

Treatment of fistula patients

The same bench on Tuesday directed the health secretary to file a compliance report about arrangements made at government hospitals to treat fistula patients.

In compliance with an earlier order of the bench on a petition about fistula repair, health secretary Usman Chachar submitted that a requisition of appointment of nine gynaecologists especially dedicated to Tharparkar was sent to the Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) and it recommended only one candidate. The recommendations of SPSC on remaining posts were still awaited.

He further said that another requisition for appointment of 62 gynaecologists as well as to appoint 429 doctors had also been sent to SPSC, adding that he personally contacted the chairman of the SPSC to expedite the process.

The heath secretary submitted that a request had been made to the finance secretary for an amount of Rs5.880 million for maternal, neonatal and child health.

He contended that the facility to treat fistula patients was available at Chandka Medical College Hospital in Larkana, Peoples Medical College Hospital in Shaheed Benazirabad and the Liaquat University of Medical Sciences Hospital in Jamshoro and sought one monthâs time to make the facility available at Ghulam Mohammad Mahar Medical College Sukkur.

In Karachi, the facility is available at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and the Koohi Goth Medical Hospital, a charitable hospital being operated by the main petitioner, he added.

The secretary said that his technical team would examine the reported cases of fistula repair in Karachi in consultation with the petitioners and after a proper evaluation further arrangements in different government hospitals at Karachi would be made.

The petitioners, including gynaecologist Dr Shershah Syed, contended that around 5,000 women died during pregnancy every year in the province due to lack of healthcare facilities in the rural areas.

They further submitted that there was a shortage of medical facilities as well as trained staff to attend to the patients, adding that the government had launched the maternal and newborn child health programme many years ago, but the funds allocated for the programme were never utilised.

The petitioners contended that there were over 1,500 fistula patients in the province, whereas a majority of government hospitals do not provide fistula repair surgeries.

They pleaded that the authorities concerned were directed to ensure access to affordable treatment of obstetric fistula to all women in the province and said that the provincial government should ensure that at least one qualified gynaecologist in every district was trained and equipped to provide fistula repair surgery.

Grant approved for treatment of girl

The bench was informed on Tuesday that the provincial government had approved an amount of Rs2,900,000 for a bone marrow transplant of an eight-year-old girl of Dadu.

The chief justice of SHC had taken notice about the illness of Rahat Batool since her parents could not afford her treatment.

In a previous hearing, the division bench headed by Justice Mazhar had directed the provincial government to provide funds for the treatment of the girl.

On Monday an official said that a summary was approved and the cheque would be handed over to the National Institute of Blood Diseases (NIBD) in three weeks.

He also said that the girl was admitted to the NIBD and the treatment had been started. The bench directed to hand over the cheque to the NIBD within a week.

Thalassaemia centres

An official of the health department on Tuesday sought time from the two-judge SHC bench to file a progress report about thalassaemia centres.

Mohammad Muzaffar and others moved the SHC seeking establishment of thalassaemia centres in Thatta and Sujawal districts.

The health official contended that they had already been making efforts to set up such centres and added that he would file a progress report at the next hearing as to how many thalassaemia centres were under operation with the cooperation of the Sindh government. The matter was adjourned till Feb 19.

57,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457759/sepa-to-seek-complete-details-of-dha-city-projects,"Sepa to seek âcomplete detailsâ of DHA City projects
",1/16/2019,"KARACHI: The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) will ask the DHA City managers to provide complete details of its ongoing and future projects and carry out a cumulative impact assessment study.

This assurance came from Sepa during a public hearing held on Tuesday where they were quizzed over a lack of information about the DHA City projects.

The public hearing pertained to the environmental impact study of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCHRC) to be built at the Healthcare City, part of DHA City, in Gadap Town.

Public hearing about environmental impact study of Rs4.5bn Shaukat Khanum cancer hospital project held

Located near M-9, the project is estimated to cost Rs4.5 billion. Itâs planned to get operational by 2021 as a 50-bedded facility and gradually have 400 beds for in-house patients.

The programme started off with a briefing on the hospital project. Zahid Hashmi, representing the hospital, said that it would be a third such facility by the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust in the country, which would act as a model institution for treatment of cancer patients in the countryâs southern region.

âThe project would be a state-of-the-art facility and would get accreditation by the Joint Commission International, one of the worldâs leading patient safety organisations,â he said.

At present, there were only three hospitals in the country with JCI accreditation and SKMCHRC Lahore was one of them, he added.

Sharing project details, he said the hospital consisting of a basement and ground-plus-six floors would be spread over 20 acres and developed in three stages.

âThe hospital will be equipped with the latest cancer care technology, including radiation bunkers fitted with linear accelerators for radiotherapy and nuclear medicine,â he said.

Giving a presentation on the projectâs EIA study conducted by Global Environmental Management Services Pvt Ltd, Syeda Ibtasama Khatoon, representing the consultant, informed the audience that internationally reputed firms were being involved in its building and engineering design and its construction would also be supervised by experts.

âThe hospital would have its own underground septic tank from where waste would be discharged into the DHA City sewage channels. Water requirement is estimated to be 12,000 gallons daily which would be met through supplies from the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board, DHA City as well as groundwater,â she said.

On the projectâs environmental impact, it was pointed out that the proposed project site had âlow abundance of flora and fauna, so its ecological impact is also low, which made the site ideal for constructing the facility.

âThe proposed project wonât have any long-term impacts if activities are undertaken as suggested in this EIA report,â said Ms Khatoon.

Her presentation was followed by a question-answer session, which began with a Sepa official raising concerns over patient access to the hospital and disposal of refuse, including nuclear waste.

Responding to the concerns, Naved Zaheer, director of the Engineering Consultants International Ltd (ECIL), responsible for the projectâs detailed engineering design and construction supervision, said that there would be a separate access for patients.

âThere would be on-site incinerators and a waste treatment plant, separate from the one to be built by DHA City, whereas nuclear waste would be handled as per the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority guidelines,â he said.

The ECIL also specialised in healthcare design and the company had to its credit several hospitals in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Yemen and Pakistan, he added.

He rejected the possibility of any emergency involving nuclear waste leakage and said that radiation activity undertaken at such health facilities were of very low intensity and waste was handled as per the guidelines.

During the session, Sepa officials admitted that they didnât have knowledge of that particular project when they approved the EIA study of DHA City in 2011.

âAt that time, plots for residential, commercial and amenity purposes were only earmarked and investors came later in the picture,â said Imran Sabir, representing Sepa.

Replying to concerns about the fast-paced infrastructural developments in DHA City and how they would impact the environment, the communities living in surrounding areas and affect Karachiâ water resources in coming years, Naeem Mughal, additional director general of Sepa, assured the audience that the agency would ensure compliance with environmental and hospital management rules and regulations in the project/s.

âWe will have a meeting with DHA City managers and seek complete details of their ongoing and future projects. We will ask them to submit their updated master plan as well as carry out a cumulative impact assessment of the whole project,â he said.

Dr Viqar Hussain, a senior geologist and consultant, urged Sepa to ensure that DHA City must evolve a plan for waste-water treatment and recycling.

Concern over the absence of DHA Cityâs representation was also raised.

58,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457760/sindh-assembly-adopts-resolution-to-stem-alarming-population-growth-in-sindh,"Sindh Assembly adopts resolution to stem âalarmingâ population growth in Sindh
",1/16/2019,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution unanimously calling upon the provincial government to take measures to rein in population growth in Sindh.

Two members of the religious parties opposed the resolution, moved by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistanâs Rana Ansar, during the debate. However, they were absent in the house when Speaker Siraj Durrani placed it for voting and it was passed unanimously.

The mover had originally scripted the resolution with the words âto controlâ the population. After an extensive debate, the words were replaced with âto planâ and approved by the house.

âWe want to provide 100pc coverage through the LHW programme for which recruitments are being madeâ

âThis assembly resolves that [the] provincial government [should] take measures to plan population and launch awareness campaigns in this regard,â said the resolution.

Ms Ansar appreciated the Sindh chief minister saying that Sindh was the first province which set up a task force to âplanâ the alarmingly increasing population. However, she said the government still had to do a lot of work.

She said the population issue should be part of the curriculum.

The MQM-P lawmaker said the government should use its lady health workersâ network effectively to launch greater awareness both in women and men.

âThis should be a joint initiative by all the provinces if we [are] to handle the population problem,â she said.

Rana Ansar said slain prime minister Benazir Bhutto was the first leader who had launched the programme to seriously tackle the population issue, but later no targets could be achieved.

Health ministerâs assurance

Population Welfare and Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho gave a detailed account of her ministry, stating that the population welfare department was seriously engaged in its effort to make planned population a reality.

âWe are working on it diligently to ensure planned and responsible parenthood,â said Dr Pechuho.

She suggested to the mover that it was not controlling the population, as the latter had suggested in her original draft, but âwe are working towards planned parenthoodâ.

The minister said: âWe have limited resources, limited area and limited water reserves, all [this] warrants that we should not have a rapid and haphazard population growthâ.

She said Sindhâs population was close to 50 million out of around 210 million of the countryâs population. She added that women were the ultimate sufferers of the entire scenario.

âWoman is being deemed a child-producing factory at the expense of her own health and life. We have a horrible mothersâ mortality ratio, which is 178 out of 1,000,â she said. âThere should be at least three-year birth space for a mother.â

Dr Pechuho said her ministry had chalked out various strategies to achieve the targets it had set. She said originally the LHW programme was launched to provide 45 per cent health coverage. However, with the passage of time the coverage dwindled due to decrease in the original strength of LHWs because of no regular recruitment.

She added: âNow, we want to provide 100pc coverage through the LHW programme for which recruitments are being made.â

She said the LHWs were being trained for advocacy and planned parenthood involving birth spacing and improved use of contraceptives. She added that the LHWs had been prepared to administer the first injection to mothers.

Responding to a memberâs earlier speech objecting to rampant surgeries in women to stop pregnancy, the minister said such an action was the last resort.

Increased use of contraceptives

She said Sindh was the only province which had registered an increase in the use of contraceptives, though by a single percentage point. She added that the rural districts of Sindh had returned the figures showing a four per cent increase in the use of contraceptives.

However, in cities such as Karachi and Hyderabad the use of contraceptives had decreased.

She said the cities such as Karachi had a greater ratio of migrant population, which too had contributed to decreasing contraceptive usage rates.

All the basic health units and rural health centres were offering delivery and family planning services where contraceptives had also been made available, she said.

The minister said the government was providing free contraceptives to 200 privately run healthcare facilities and such hospitals were located in Karachi and several other districts. She said since the health department controlled the LHW programme, plans were afoot to integrate it with the population welfare department for better planning.

MQM-Pâs Mohammad Hussain said political will was needed to achieve the target of a controlled population growth. He claimed the population welfare department was not proactive to achieve its designated targets.

Women Development Minister Shehla Raza also suggested the mover rearticulate the resolution by replacing âcontrolâ with âplanningâ the population.

PPPâs Kulsoom Chandio and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insafâs Shehzad Qureshi said the authorities concerned should take further measures and that they would have to work hard, particularly in the rural areas.

Grand Democratic Allianceâs Nusrat Abbasi said why only women were forced to go for surgery to stop pregnancy and why not such operations were performed on men.

MMA, TLP oppose the move

Muttahida Majlis-i-Amalâs sole member Abdul Rasheed opposed the resolution saying: âYou will face the consequences if you go against the laws of natureâ.

He claimed Pakistanâs population growth was ranked 84th in the world, and was not that high.

âPakistan will be a country of elderly people if you control its population like that,â he warned.

Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistanâs Mohammad Qasim opposed the resolution bluntly.

He said: âAllah has promised sustenance in the Holy Quran, and no force could go against itâ.

Bills

The house approved for introduction two private bills â The Sindh Water Management (Amendment) Bill, 2018, moved by Rana Ansar, and The Control of Narcotic Substances (Sindh Amendment) Bill, 2018, moved by Rabia Nizami.

PPPâs Heer Soho withdrew her adjournment motion asking the federal government to give due share of NFC award to Sindh as contemplated in Article 160 (3A) of the Constitution after the chair said an extensive debate had already been held a day earlier on another adjournment motion by Nida Khuhro.

",1/16/2019,"KARACHI: The Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) on Tuesday raided the head office of a private courier company and seized a parcel carrying over a kilogram of heroin which was booked for Canada, said a statement.

It said the raid was conducted in a Korangi area on an intelligence report suggesting that a parcel carrying the drug was being sent overseas in the garb of a regular consignment.

âOfficials of ANF police station-2 Korangi, Karachi, on a tip-off reached the office of a private courier service, intercepted the suspicious parcel and recovered drugs concealed in ladiesâ fancy suits,â said an official of the force.

âThe parcel was booked on the national identity card of Mirza Maqsood, son of M. Mirza Fazal Hussain, resident of Karachi, for Nesto Riza, resident of Canada. Further investigation has been initiated by the ANF,â he added.

In another action, the Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, claimed to have arrested two suspected street criminals from Model Colony, said a statement. Both the suspects, the paramilitary force said, were wanted in several cases, including street crimes and robbery.

They said the suspects named Dil Murad, aka Mahmood, and Tauseef, aka Mushki, were arrested after a raid in Model Colony area. Illegal arms, ammunition, cash and valuables were seized from them.

",1/16/2019,"KARACHI: Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry suggested on Tuesday that the PPP itself remove Syed Murad Ali Shah from office for âfacilitating corruptionâ; otherwise the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf would take âpracticalâ measures for bringing the change that he said was imminent.

He also termed the PPP-led Sindh government âoccupation of Sindhâ.

The minister arrived in Karachi for a daylong visit. He spent a busy day, met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, chaired a meeting of party leaders and legislators from Sindh and held talks with leaders of coalition parties.

Assures MQM-P that promises made at the time of govt formation will be fulfilled

Amid different engagements, Mr Chaudhry maintained the same tone and sounded firm on his partyâs stance against the PPP-led Sindh government.

âThe PPP has actually occupied Sindh,â he said while talking to reporters at Karachi airport. âWe support the democratic system and thatâs why we want to give them [PPP leadership] time so they take an initiative and take resignation from Murad Ali Shah. If they donât take action then we would be bound to take practical measures for the change thatâs imminent and definitely would be witnessed by the people of Sindh.â

He accused CM Shah of âfacilitatingâ corruption and wrongdoings of former president Asif Ali Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur and private business conglomerate Omni Group, which he said had taken out a Rs54 billion loan from the Sindh Bank with the support of Mr Shah.

âThe PTI stands with the people of Sindh whose money had been found in the banks of Dubai and London instead of [being spent] on them. The wave of change, which has been witnessed by other provinces, would now be seen in Sindh. It is the right of the people of Sindh to become part of the change,â said the information minister.

He also claimed that he was approached by PPP legislators from Sindh, who wanted a change in the province and were looking towards the PTI for development in Sindh.

Asks why NAB not arresting Zardari

Later in the day, he told reporters at the residence of PTIâs Haleem Adil Shaikh that he was surprised as to why the National Accountability Bureau was not arresting Mr Zardari, Ms Talpur and CM Shah despite the fact that their names had appeared in the report of joint investigation team as âkey suspectsâ.

âItâs quite unfortunate that the performance of NAB is not satisfactory and itâs moving at a slow pace,â he said. âMr Zardari and Faryal Talpur have made the people of Sindh hostage while Murad Ali Shah facilitated all their wrongdoings despite holding a key office in the province and all this is documented in the JIT report. Despite all these facts [they] are not arrested yet, which is quite surprising.â

Visits MQM-P head office

Later, he visited the temporary headquarters of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan in Bahadurabad, where he discussed implementation on several decisions made between the two coalition partners a few months ago.

The federal minister brushed aside the impression of any dispute or disagreement between the two sides while reiterating the âpolitical importance of the MQM-Pâ.

âMQM is a political reality and one of [the] key coalition partners of the PTI government,â Mr Chaudhry told reporters after the meeting. âIn todayâs meeting, we have discussed and reviewed the memorandum of understanding which we signed at the time of formation of the government.

",1/16/2019,"MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider on Tuesday claimed that the issues relating to the environmental and economic concerns arising out of Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project (NJHP) had been amicably settled with the federal government.

Speaking on the floor of the Legislative Assembly, he said the federal government had constituted a high-powered committee after its attention was drawn by the AJK government in black and white to address these issues.

The committee that includes representatives of important institutions had agreed to all four points raised by the AJK government and had also dispatched its favourable report to the office of Prime Minister of Pakistan, he added.

The AJK premier maintained that his government had taken serious stock of environmental and economic impact of NJHP that emerged after its commissioning. âWe constituted a committee of the heads of all parliamentary parties, apart from convening a conference of all stakeholders, including senior political figures from Muzaffarabad,â he said, adding that these steps had led the federal government to constitute the committee.

Mr Haider said the NJHP was a national project and the Kashmiris had always offered sacrifices in the interest of Pakistan.

âWe will continue to do so in future because a strong and prosperous Pakistan is the nucleus of our hopes and aspirations,â he said, expressing the hope that the federal government would provide full support for mitigation of environmental and other issues in the light of the report, prepared by its committee.

He informed the house that the reservations about Kohala Hydropower Project had also been conveyed to the federal government and he was hopeful that those would also be addressed.

The AJK premier rubbished Indian governmentâs allegation that Pakistan was non-serious in dialogue as the âbiggest lieâ, and said Delhi had always used dialogue as a ploy to kill time and defuse international pressure.

Over the past seven decades, there had been numerous sessions of dialogue between the two sides, but India never showed seriousness to make the process meaningful and result-oriented, he said.

He seized the opportunity to praise Nawaz Sharif, saying his services for strengthening democracy in Pakistan were invaluable.

",1/16/2019,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court will take up on Jan 21 appeals filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against the acquittal of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in the Flagship Investment reference and for enhancement of his sentence from seven years to 14 years in the Al-Azizia reference.

A two-judge IHC bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani will also hear an appeal of Mr Sharif against his conviction in the Al-Azizia reference as well as a petition seeking suspension of the sentence in this reference the same day.

An accountability court had on Dec 24 last year convicted Mr Sharif in the Al-Azizia/Hill Metal Establishment reference, sentenced him to seven years in prison and fined him Rs1.5 billion and $25 million. Accountability court judge Mohammad Arshad Malik, however, acquitted the former prime minister in the Flagship Investment reference.

Mr Sharifâs appeal argued that certain observations made by the accountability court judge were against the âprinciples governing administration of criminal justice in Pakistan, and of the principle of fair trial as guaranteed to all citizens of the country by Article 10-A of the Constitutionâ. It pointed out that the judge had used a word âbeneficial ownerâ for the accused despite the fact that this word was never mentioned in the National Accountability Ordinance.

On the other hand, NAB argued in its appeal that the accountability court did not consider evidence in the Flagship Investment reference and in the Al-Azizia reference. The bureau argued that the court took a lenient view and awarded seven-year sentence to the former premier, instead of maximum 14 years.

A team of South district police â reportedly led by Clifton SP Suhai Aziz â had on Sunday (January 13) carried out a raid on the Morocco Lounge cafÃ© located in DHA Phase V, on reports that a sheesha bar was being operated inside the facility, a press release issued by SSP South Pir Muhammad Shah said.

The SSP tried to clarify that Suhai Aziz was not in charge of a ""private police party"".

According to the statement, a large quantity of ""unhealthy"" tobacco sheesha was recovered during the raid.

Police had also registered a case against the owners of the cafÃ© for ""secretly"" operating a sheesha bar.

During the raid, four policemen had consumed Red Bull energy drink that was available at the restaurant, SSP Shah said.

Footage obtained by DawnNewsTV showed a number of policemen reaching into a mini fridge and retrieving what appeared to be cans of drinks. At least one cop was also caught munching on what appeared to be a snack.

""Departmental action"" was taken against the four police officials, and they have since been suspended, the police statement said.

Meanwhile, Sindh Inspector General of Police Dr Syed Kaleem Imam took notice of media reports regarding the police party ""allegedly torturing citizens and holding [them] hostage"" during the raid at the restaurant. TV footage showed armed policemen dragging and shoving a couple of men, who appeared to be employees.

According to a press release, the Sindh police chief has directed the SSP South to immediately submit a detailed inquiry report into the incident.

",1/15/2019,"Tragedy befell a home on Rawalpindi's Sixth Road where preparations were taking place for a wedding, as a fire erupted and burned alive five women, including the bride-to-be.

The victims were identified as the 24-year-old bride, Sana; 14-year-old Hina; 20-year-old Hafza; 25-year-old Manahil; and 22-year-old Nayna.

Four women died on the spot while the fifth women, who had received serious burn wounds, succumbed to her injuries at the hospital, DawnNewsTV reported. The bodies have been handed over to the families of the deceased.

Eyewitnesses told DawnNewsTV that the fire broke out on the ground floor of the house and moved upwards to engulf the upper storey.

The homeowner, Malik Abdul Ghani, while narrating the incident to DawnNewsTV, laid the blame on rescue services: ""They did not arrive timely and as a result five women, including my daughter are now dead.""

The aggrieved father said his daughter was due to be married on Thursday, whereas today, a mehendi ceremony was going to take place.

When the fire broke out, between 40 and 50 guests were present within the home. Some had to jump out from the upper floor in order to save their lives.

According to New Town Assistant Superintendent Police (ASP) Ziauddin, the source of the fire remains a mystery and it is being investigated whether the cause was a short circuit in the wiring, a gas leakage, or if it was a case of arson. He said that to this end, the Punjab Forensic Science Agency was also being consulted.

Former MPA Raja Hanif, an eyewitness to the tragedy, alleged that the rescue services arrived late and that the first fire truck to have arrived at the scene ""did not have any water"".

Rescue services official Farooq Butt denied the allegations and said the rescue team had reached the residence six minutes after being alerted of the fire. However, they were ""subjected to violence"" which delayed rescue efforts and prevented the team from controlling the fire timely.

""Every individual present at the site of the incident was in a fit of rage and our operations were continuously interrupted,"" he said, adding that ""even then, due to their tireless efforts, the fire brigade team managed to control the fire"".

Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed also visited the site of the incident and extended his condolences to the family.

He said the ""entire house was constructed from wood, which is why the fire spread so quickly"".

The duo, who were present in the court today, apologised to judge Muhammad Asghar Khan for their absence in previous court proceedings. Subsequently, their arrest warrants were cancelled.

",1/15/2019,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Bahria Town's offer to deposit Rs250 billion to avoid legal proceedings for illegally acquiring land for its projects in Karachi, Islamabad and Murree.

An implementation bench of the apex court was hearing a case pertaining to the implementation on a May 4, SC verdict against Bahria Town. Under the order, the court had barred M/s Bahria Town Karachi from selling any plot or constructed apartment in the housing scheme on the outskirts of the port city, declaring the grant of land to the Malir DevelopÂ­ment Authority and its exchange with the land of the private land developers illegal and void ab initio.

At the outset of today's hearing, a counsel on behalf of Bahria Town offered to submit Rs200 billion to waive off charges against the real estate developer.

Justice Azmat Saeed, who was heading the three-member bench, reminded the counsel that a fine of Rs285 billion had been imposed on Bahria Town in 2004. ""If the fine money is increased by 40 per cent, it will amount to Rs300bn.""

Take a look: Bahria Town Karachi: Greed unlimited

Justice Saeed noted that three separate verdicts had been passed against Bahria Town, so it should make ""separate and reasonable"" offers for its projects in Karachi, Islamabad and Murree.

At this, Bahira Town's counsel increased the offer to Rs250bn.

""This is not a suitable way to deal with [the apex court],"" Justice Saeed said, reprimanding the lawyer. ""We may ask the National Accountability Bureau to file a reference.""

The counsel sought one week's time to file a reply. Justice Saeed granted the plea and directed Bahria Town to submit written offers in all the three cases.

""Our mistake was not that big,"" the counsel argued.

""Mistake is supposed to be of one or two kanals, not of thousands of acres,"" the judge replied.

The implementation bench was formed after the court had dropped the review petitions filed against its May 4 judgement barring Bahria Town Karachi from selling any plots or constructed apartments.

In its May 4 judgement, the court had declared the grant of land to the Malir Development Authority (MDA) and its exchange with the land of Bahria Town illegal and void. It had also directed NAB to continue its probe into the matters of the developer.

During the last hearing in the case, the bench had ordered the bureau to file separate references on a series of matters stemming from the Bahria Town Karachi project, including the arrears of three MDA projects.

During an earlier hearing, the court had reprimanded NAB, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) and the administration of Bahria Town, over what it termed their ""non-cooperation"" in implementing a ruling of the apex court.

",1/15/2019,"A joint investigation team (JIT) on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that ousted premier Nawaz Sharif had illegally allotted 14,398 acres of Waqf property attached to the shrine of Hazrat Baba Farid-ud-Din Masud Ganj Shakar in Pakpattan to Dewan Ghulam Qutab during his tenure as Punjab chief minister in 1986.

Sharif has been accused of illegally allotting the shrine's land during his tenure as chief minister in violation of a high court order after ordering the withdrawal of a notification dated Dec 17, 1969.

The SC-mandated JIT formed to probe the allegations against Sharif submitted a report on its findings during today's hearing.

Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Director General Hussain Asghar, who was heading the JIT, told the court that Sharif had, in addition to the Pakpattan shrine land, allotted land in Hujra Shah Muqeem along with that of the shrine of Hafiz Jamalullah Multani.

Asghar told the court that an investigation report prepared in 2015 had held the then chief minister responsible. However, the chief minister's name was excluded in a second report that was submitted in 2016. The JIT, concluding that then chief minister did not have the authority to transfer the land, recommended that that land be retrieved and criminal proceedings be initiated against Sharif, then secretary to chief minister Syed Javed Iqbal Bukhari, the legal heirs of Deewan Ghulam Qutub Din, assistant administrator of Auqaf Pakpattan during 1969 and 1986 as well as the patwaris of the area ""where these irregularities and illegalities were committed"".

Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar who was heading the three-member bench hearing the case today said that ""times have changed and a third report will not be prepared"".

""Why was this land allotted illegally?"" the chief justice inquired, warning that ""no one will be able to escape if an investigation is launched"".

Sharif's counsel Barrister Munawar Iqbal said that the former premier had rejected the allegations earlier.

""You're playing the role of [the person] more loyal to the king than the king himself,"" Justice Nisar remarked. ""We may order the Anti-Corruption Establishment to file a complaint.""

",1/15/2019,"Two suspected members of the militant Islamic State group allegedly linked to the 2013 abduction of former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's son, Ali Haider Gilani, were killed in a pre-dawn raid on a 'militant hideout' in Faisalabad on Tuesday, a Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official said.

CTD official Rai Tahir identified the two militants as Adeel Hafeez and Usman Haroon. He said both were killed during an intense shootout in the raid conducting by security officials.

Tahir said officials had, in the past, foiled other attacks the pair had plotted, adding that they were also behind the killing of two intelligence officials in recent years as well as other high-profile crimes.

The two militants were also linked to the 2011 Al Qaeda abduction of an American development worker, Warren Weinstein, the official said. Weinstein, who was taken from Lahore, was accidentally killed in a United States drone strike in 2015 on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He provided no specific information about the role the two had in Weinstein's case.

The American worker's accidental death was announced by Washington in 2015. President Barack Obama at the time said he took full responsibility for US counter-terror missions and offered his condolences to families of the hostages.

After the Sept 11 attacks in the United States, Washington aggressively targeted militant hideouts in neighbouring Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal regions, killing local and foreign militants. Pakistan considers US drone strikes a violation of its sovereignty, while the US accuses Pakistan of providing safe havens for militants. Pakistan has always denied the charge, saying it acts against militants without discrimination.

Kamran then challenged the vote and the deputy speaker ordered a headcount. The headcount revealed that 96 MNAs opposed the bill, while 94 were in favour of it. Therefore, the NA decided against the move.

",1/15/2019,"Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry warned on Tuesday that if the PPP is unable to bring change to Sindh and the chief minister does not resign, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government ""will need to take practical steps"".

Chaudhry, while speaking to reporters upon arrival in Karachi, explained that the government wants ""the PPP to bring change themselves"", and for a new chief minister to take the place of Murad Shah, a senior PPP leader who was named in the joint investigation team's report in the fake accounts case.

""We want to first give them an opportunity [to bring change]. If this opportunity is not availed, and they do not take advantage of it, and Murad Shah does not resign, then we will certainly need to take practical steps here,"" he said.

When asked about the possibility of the PTI forming a forward bloc in the PPP to remove the provincial government, Chaudhry responded that any person who carries the pain of the people of Sindh in his heart will want change in the province, no matter what party he belongs to.

He said that even 'serious' members of the PPP wanted change, adding that when this issue began, PPP members had themselves contacted the PTI and asked it to step forward for change.

""It is also a right of the people of Sindh to see the wave of change that the three other provinces have seen, that all of Pakistan has seen. It is the right of the people of Sindh that they become part of this change,"" he added.

The federal minister pointed out that Sindh had not contributed to the National Finance Commission award for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) although the ""other provinces and the federal government had given their share for its development"".

The PTI-run Federal, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments had decided on Jan 4 to jointly provide the equivalent of 3pc of the federal divisible pool for uplifting Fata after its merger with KP.

Chaudhry claimed that although the PPP paints itself as a ""vision of democracy"", when the time for action came, it disassociated itself from Fata.

He alleged that Sindh's money would ""not be spent on the poor people"" of the province. ""It will go to the Omni Group and into branches of the Zardari Gropu of companies. The painful thing is that Sindh's funds are being spent in London and Dubai.""

He claimed that those who are ""closest to the people will talk about change"", and that a large majority of the PPP MPAs would side with the PTI.

The tenure of Zardari's monarchy has come to an end, similarly, the Sindh's lease to Omni group has also expired, the minister said.

""I am astonished that NAB still hasn't arrested Asif, Faryal and Murad Ali Shah despite the fact that the watchdog has to complete the probe in two months.""

He alleged that the ""residents of Bilawal House"" and ""the man in CM House [in Karachi]"" are beneficiary of the fake accounts. He also accused the watchdog of showing leniency.

Chaudhry said no doubt the 18th Amendment has several positive impacts, including devolution of power which enabled transfer of large funds to provinces. ""But the point is, where did these funds go?""

""They [PPP] are demanding funds form themselves and not for the people of Sindh. Whenever the rulers in Sindh are asked about accountability, suddenly the democracy becomes âvulnerableâ,"" the minister remarked.

PTI-PPP tussle heats up

A tussle between the PPP and PTI over money laundering and the fake bank accounts case has heated up in recent days, with the ruling party in Sindh accusing the Centre of attempting to dislodge the provincial government and warning it of dire consequences if any attempt is made to arrest top party cadre.

Chaudhry's two-day trip to Sindh scheduled for December was shelved after Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar's observations during an earlier hearing of the fake accounts case indicated that the PTI was trying to topple the PPP government.

Chaudhry was allegedly tasked by the prime minister to meet leaders of political parties apart from the PPP during his earlier trip to Sindh and seek their support for dislodging the PPP government.

The information minister, however, has denied that his party wishes to dislodge the PPP government. ""We do not want to dislodge the PPP government in Sindh but want to forge consensus on the demand for resignation of Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to ensure fair trial of Asif Ali Zardari and company,â he had said earlier, adding that the PTI had no intention to impose governor's rule in Sindh or repeal the 18th Amendment.

The information minister had explained during an earlier press conference that his visit had been cancelled by Prime MInister Imran Khan to reject the impression that the Centre wanted to topple the Sindh government.

PPP is the majority party in the Sindh Assembly with 99 seats while the PTI and its allies have a total of 64 seats. The PTI requires 18 more members to outnumber the PPP to form its government in the province. However, it is believed that it would be a hard nut to crack to defeat the PPP in the provincial assembly as the party enjoys a formidable position in the province since long and has been in office there for over a decade.",Dawn.com,Dawn,Politics,"Fawad Chaudhry, PPP, Karachi, PTI",0,"['information', 'minister', 'fawad', 'chaudhry', 'warned', 'tuesday', 'ppp', 'unable', 'bring', 'change',

",1/15/2019,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday in its verdict in a suo motu case on the increasing population said that the government, civil society and religious scholars should all take steps to tackle the issue.

A three-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ijazul Ahsan, was hearing the case. Population control is the latest campaign the SC has extended its support to.

According to the 2017 census, which was held after a gap of 19 years, the countryâs population is approximately 207,774,520 living in 32,205,111 households. The results show that Pakistan has moved up the ladder becoming the fifth most populous nation only behind India, China, the United States and Indonesia. Top government officials have decided to reduce the population growth rate of 2.4 per cent per annum to 1.5pc.

The SC in its verdict today observed that an increasing population is a stress on the country's resources and likened the growth to an explosion.

""We need a campaign to decrease the population,"" the court said. ""It is a question of the future of our coming generations.""

""The entire nation must stand united on the matter of population planning,"" said chief justice Nisar, who has termed unbridled population growth as the ""most disastrous issue"" for Pakistan.

In yesterday's hearing, the court was told by the health secretary that a demographic survey is conducted every five years. The last one was in 2018 and its results bore little difference compared to the survey before that, the secretary told the bench.

The chief justice asked about progress made on its earlier orders, to which the secretary had responded that a report was submitted.

""Every three months, the court will assess the implementation of the report,"" the chief justice said, referring to recommendations made by a task force that had been set up to probe the matter.

",1/15/2019,"Writers, journalists and civil society activists gathered outside the Lahore Press Club on Monday in protest against the ban on Nandita Das film Manto.

âManto was screened all over the world and it won an award in Bangladesh but it was banned in the writerâs own country,â lamented journalist and secretary general of Manto Memorial Society Saeed Ahmed.

He said Manto himself was not treated well in Pakistan and when he came to Lahore after the Partition, his entry was banned into the radio station. The ânew Pakistanâ under the PTI government was treating him the same way as he was treated in old Pakistan 10 years back, he said, appealing to the government to lift the ban on the movie. He said it was a countrywide protest as similar demonstrations against the ban on Manto were being held in Karachi and Peshawar.

Calling for the freedom of expression, painter Salima Hashmi said: âManto was kept deprived of this right in his life and after so many years, he is still facing the same oppression.â

She said Manto was the most read Urdu prose writer in the world, condemning the attitude of the government towards him.

Veteran journalist Hussain Naqi said Manto was the most-read and most-translated Pakistani writer who was known all over the world and banning the film made on his life could not be justified from any point of view. He also condemned the alleged government action against the Manto festival scheduled to be held at Alhamra Art Centre.

âOne of the best works on Partition and subsequent years are in the form of Mantoâs short stories which are as important as poetry of Faiz Sahib,â he added.

Abdul Waheed of the Progressive Writers Association said the ban on film showed Manto was as unacceptable for the state institution as he was 70 years back which exposed the stagnation of society. He said the nation had not progressed socially, morally and intellectually.

Farooq Tariq of the Awami Workers Party praised Nandita Dasâs film on Manto, saying the protest was against the ban on the movie that was screened across the world except in Pakistan. Writer Husssain Majrooh also spoke.

",1/15/2019,"THE PTI-run Federal, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments decided on Jan 4 to jointly provide equivalent to three per cent of the federal divisible pool for uplifting the erstwhile Fata region following its merger with KP.

The decision is stated to have been prompted by the delay in formation of the National Finance Commission (NFC) and expected reluctance by Sindh and Balochistan to tinker with the 7th NFC award. When Fata was a federal territory, provinces had opposed diversion of funds from the NFCâs divisible pool to finance the regionâs development needs.

Stipulated to be enforced from the next financial year, the decision is projected to raise Rs108 billion, including Punjabâs contribution of Rs38.3bn The ad-hoc decision indicates that it will be tough for the PTI government to forge a consensus for the next NFC award.

Since the PTI has come into power, the Sindh government has been criticising some of the federal governmentâs proposals for exceeding the constitutional limits.

On Jan 5, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah told the prime ministerâs Special Assistant on Power Shahzad Qasim, who called on him in Karachi, that the decision of the Federal Cabinet Committee on Energy to reduce the life of solar and wind projects from 20 to 15 years was illegal and unconstitutional. He pointed out that the Council of Common Interests was the only constitutional forum to decide electricity policy issues and sought withdrawal of the decision.

In this age of networking, unilateral and arbitrary actions can deliver, at best, only partially

During the same week, the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Reforms demanded that Rs9bn donations collected for two mega-dams be diverted for building small and medium ones for water-starved Balochistan to support agriculture and livestock development and create job opportunities in the province.

The panel felt the collected amount was meagre, considering the cost of the Diamer-Bhasha dam was estimated at Rs1 trillion and Mohmand dam at Rs300bn. With the same amount, the committee estimated that the number of dams planned for Balochistan could be increased from 100 to 500.

Unlike big dams for which foreign loans are required, the Rs9bn could best be invested in the province to bring virgin lands under plough and boost output of fruits and meat for exports.

The building of the mega-dams has also been opposed by Sindh where the provincial government has announced its intention to set up two desalination plants for Karachi, owing to water scarcity, both for household use and irrigation purposes. Sindh wants a policy shift to modern methods of water conservation including increased usage of drip and sprinkler systems.

Even within the ranks of the PTI and its coalition partners, there seems to be no consensus on the partyâs heavy agenda.

The PML-Q , an important coalition partner, shares views with PML-N on the creation of Bahawalpur province and the party does not subscribe to the creation of South Punjab as envisaged by PTI.

Finally, the PTIâs recent perceived move to impose governor rule in Sindh and destabilise Chief Minister Murad Ali Shahâs government was not supported by coalition partner MQM-P and fellow traveller Sindh Democratic Alliance leader Pir Saheb Pagara. PTI has failed to recognise the sway of participatory federal democracy over the countryâs politics after the 18th Constitutional Amendment.

A second mini-budget within a short span of time, due later this month, reflects PTIâs ad hoc-ism that is not a part of an implementable long-term plan

To quote Fitch,âpolitical headwinds are growing in Pakistanâ which, it may be added, requires consensus building for resolving agitating problems so far defying solutions. A second mini-budget within a short span of time, due later this month, reflects PTIâs ad hoc-ism that is not a part of an implementable long-term plan.

Official data bears this out. During July-December 2018, the net dollar reserves of the State Bank have fallen from $10.2bn to $7.3bn and those held by commercial banks are stagnant at around $6.5bn.

Simultaneously, budgetary borrowings have soared by 86pc to Rs722bn owing to a shortfall of Rs112bn in targeted federal tax revenue and surge in non-development spending. Though the trade gap is reducing, the increase in exports and home remittances are not fast enough to plug the hole in external sector accounts to a comfortable level anytime soon. There is little prospect for an export rebound, says an international research agency.

As it is, Prime Minister Imran Khan has taken over the reins of the government in difficult times. He has to grapple with enormous domestic and external challenges.

No doubt the PTI manifesto promises the nation wide ranging, virtuous reforms, but for that to happen, economic agents, bureaucracy, sub-federating units, district governments and farmers have to be energised with widest political and civil society support.

The entire nation needs to be mobilised on a practical common agenda and a coherent strategy for resolving deep-seated problems facing the country. In this age of networking, unilateral and arbitrary actions can deliver, at best, only partially.

Mr Khan has succeeded in securing financial support from Saudi Arabia ($6.2bn), UAE ( expected $6.2bn) and trade financing ($1.5bn) from the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation amounting to $13.9bn. Another $2bn has been pledged by China raising the total expected borrowings to $15.9bn in six months.

But the festering problem still remains: there is no significant boost in foreign exchange earnings insight to service ballooning external debts. External sector pressures are not expected to go away.

And business confidence is sinking in a rudderless economy despite Mr Khanâs pledge to provide an enabling environment for wealth creation.

78,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457688/are-the-states-xenophobic-policies-contributing-to-pakistans-international-isolation,"Are the state's xenophobic policies contributing to Pakistan's international isolation?
",1/15/2019,"XENOPHOBIA is unfounded fear of foreigners. It often results in actions against them that defy logic. It occurs globally, with both developing and developed countries experiencing it. And that seems like an incomplete list.

But there is a difference between ordinary people and the state exhibiting xenophobia. The former causes much damage too, like attacks on foreigners. But given the huge powers that states enjoy, state xenophobia can cause much greater harm to foreigners as they adopt misplaced policies to eliminate external threats. The US state xenophobia under Trump harms both foreigners and US interests.

Also read: The age of xenophobia

Xenophobia is not new to Pakistani society. But its state institutions have often adopted xenophobic policies, especially in the last few months. Pakistan clearly faces external threats and espionage, like most states globally. But it also faces major opportunities in interacting externally, including with those states from which it experiences threats. Smart states balance the threats and opportunities by basing concerns about foreigners on strong evidence and adopting calibrated responses that minimise the threats but not the opportunities. Unfortunately, such smart analysis seems missing from our responses in many cases.

Our institutions have often adopted shortsighted policies.

Only recently, Pakistan expelled 18 INGOs without assigning any specific reasons on a case-by-case basis. The backlash against INGOs originates from the 2011 allegations that one INGO supported Shakeel Afridi in conducting a vaccination campaign to track down Osama bin Laden. No proof was presented of the INGOâs role. The non-calibrated nature of the action against INGOs can be gauged by the fact that this particular INGO has not been expelled but 18 others having nothing to do with that incident have been.

Explore: Pressure on INGOs

The official press release vaguely refers to a failure to meet registration requirements and involvement in unauthorised activities. But apparently, none of the expelled INGOs were given any specific reasons about where they went wrong. Write-ups supporting the expulsion also mention vague âreasonsâ, such as their involvement in surveys and geo-tagging. These are standard development-sector practices followed globally by INGOs and even well-equipped state agencies. Expulsion is an extreme step to be taken only if there is concrete proof that an INGO was involved in illegal practices. So far, there is little proof that such a rule of law-based outlook was employed.

Finally, there is the provision that all expelled INGOs can reapply after six months. Why would the state entertain their applications just after six months if solid proof of wrongdoing by them was found? By expelling them on flimsy grounds, we have unnecessarily lost millions of dollars of funding, thousands of jobs and international repute.

Deeming dual citizens a security risk, a recent court verdict has asked the state to develop laws to restrict their hiring in the bureaucracy. Legal minds ask if it is the job of courts to identify security risks. But even if the executive makes such a review, it should be based on solid proof.

Dual nationality: a conflict of interest for bureaucrats?

Dual citizens have been working in the bureaucracy for several decades. How many incidents have there been of them facilitating foreign states at the expense of Pakistan? Foreign states can easily bribe willing ordinary Pakistani citizens to do so despite the ban. Expat Pakistanis with their wealth, education and goodwill for Pakistan are an asset. Both the executive and courts frequently appeal to them to donate funds in times of financial crunch.

Another verdict has declared Indian content on TV a cultural threat. Again, some legal minds ask whether the judiciary should be analysing cultural threats. And how would even the executive define and measure cultural threat? The frequency of objectionable scenes in Indian movies has increased with time. But that is an issue more with English movies, and simple censorship of specific offensive scenes rather than a blanket ban on all Indian content would seem a more calibrated response.

Rational states recognise that ordinary families and communities are quite capable of shielding impressionable young minds from cultural exposures they deem harmful and that the blunt use of state bans in the cultural arena is unnecessary. There is clearly a high demand for Indian stuff in Pakistan and vice versa. So, similarly, the Indian ban on Pakistani artists is highly deplorable.

State policies are expected to be based on careful analysis and facts. When states also start acting like impulsive citizens, the space for rationality and tolerance reduces fast in the country. While world powers have deplorably contributed to isolating Pakistan, our own ill-conceived reactions are making us even more isolated and paranoid.

",1/15/2019,"AS things move along, the need for greater transparency and disclosure on what exactly the government is signing onto is growing.

The eighth Joint Cooperation Committee meeting on CPEC between Pakistani and Chinese government delegations was held in December, but to this day, there is very little known about the details of what the government of Pakistan has consented to do.

Read more: What do Pakistan and China want from CPEC going forward?

In addition, we have seen $2bn land in the State Bank as a âdepositâ, following a visit to Saudi Arabia by the prime minister accompanied by a high-powered ministerial entourage, with promises of another billion to come soon, and a âdeferred paymentâ facility to underwrite a portion of the countryâs oil imports.

Yet, not a word has been uttered about what has been promised in return. Likewise, we are now hearing of another $3bn worth of âdepositsâ to be made by the UAE, but once again, there is not a word about what is expected in return. No details have even been released about the terms on which these âdepositsâ have come, whether on their tenure or return.

Now we are hearing of a massive investment from Saudi Arabia to be made in an âoil cityâ in Gwadar. What exactly is going on here, many wish to ask.

Foreign investment is welcome in Pakistan, but in most cases it comes under a policy framework that is transparently known, has been debated in cabinet at least, and with the terms available to all. Some sort of a bilateral framework between two countries exclusively is also fine, but it should be known to all what exactly is being built, what concessions are being granted, how Pakistanâs long-term economic interests are being served, and so on.

Foreign investment that creates jobs, transfers skills and imparts dynamism to Pakistanâs economy and spurs its markets is welcome. But investment that seeks to create a transshipment enclave, or provides exclusive access rights and privileges to one group of investors only is of debatable merit.

When government ministers are asked for details, they refuse to entertain the request on the grounds that the other party â whether China or Saudi Arabia â prefers discretion in this matter.

Discretion is fine and has its place in deal-making of the sort that is under way between the states, but since sprawling Pakistani interests are involved, transparency and disclosure requirements must not be jettisoned.

The feeling right now appears to be that the government, in its desperation to avoid the stringent terms of an IMF programme, is signing every dotted line that is placed before it by foreign powers such as China and Saudi Arabia, in return for a bailout that will last a few months at best.

This is not the kind of policymaking that the PTI promised the country in the run-up to the election.

",1/15/2019,"TAXILA: Due to lack of maintenance, a 17th century stepwell in Wahâs Sher Shah Park, locally known as Losar Baoli, is facing deterioration and the retaining wall to the west of the well has started to crumble.

The well was one of many constructed in the 17th century by the Mughals along the Grand Trunk Road to provide fresh drinking water to travellers. Such wells were constructed every three miles.

The wells were 100ft by 6ft and had a main entrance. Unlike the common method of pulling out water with a bucket tied to a pulley, these wells had stairs which had a platform at three different depths so that people could stop to fetch water at various levels.

The wells provided water to travellers and their horses.

The wells became obsolete with time and many do not exist now. One of the wells was included in the Sher Shah Park when it was established.

Quaid-i-Azam University Taxila Institute of Asia Civilisationâs former director Dr Mohammad Ashraf Khan said stepwells were first introduced by Ashoka in the third century BC in the region to facilitate pilgrims and travellers along highways.

He added that the route used to connect the Valley of Ganges with the northwest region of the subcontinent.

Dr Khan said such wells were constructed and maintained by the Mughals and that they were also used by their armies.

âThese wells and inns were built to facilitate pilgrims, travellers and armies. Royal messengers and horse riders would stay and rest at Baolies and would replace their horses so they could deliver important letters. Sometimes, the riders were changed as well,â he said.

Officials of the Punjab Department of Archaeology told Dawn that one of the walls of the well collapsed in 1990 and was restored by the authorities.

However, the authorities concerned did not undertake maintenance work which led to the collapse of a major portion of the wall on the western side.

They said that the Punjab government released funds to the Punjab Department of Archaeologyâs sub-regional office during the fiscal year 2016-17 for the restoration and the preservation of the site. However the funds lapsed as the department did not execute the project.

Department of Archaeology Deputy Director Irshad Hussain confirmed that the department had gotten funds for the maintenance of the site.

âThe funds were not enough to pay for the preservation and restoration of the site so the project was shelved,â he told Dawn.

He added that a partial restoration would not address the issue and that the project will not be executed till the required funds are received.

",1/15/2019,"GUJAR KHAN: Despite a ban, dog fighting remains one of the most popular activities in the Potohar region and an open secret.

Affluent families from Kharian, Bewal, Jabbar, Mirpur and Dhadial spend large sums of money on bull terrier breeding.

A puppy from a bull terrier who has won fights is sold for between Rs50,000 and Rs200,000, according to Chaudhry Khadim, who had come all the way from Mirpur to watch the much-awaited dog fight in Gujar Khan on Sunday.

A buffalo is set aside exclusively for providing milk to the bull terrier, who is also fed pure desi ghee during training.

Bashir Mughal, who hails from Daultala and is famous for breeding bull terriers, told Dawn that one puppy is assigned three trainers. A dogâs routine involves a 10-km jog twice a day to improve its stamina.

Another breeder, Mohammad Zakir, said his dog had recently won a fight and that he has been offered Rs1 million for it but he has refused to sell the dog.

âI bought him in Quetta and love him like family,â he said.

The Sunday fight near Gujar Khan was attended by thousands of people from Punjab, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and even people from outside the country.

The dogs were driven to the venue in cars and were given VIP treatment.

Some of the better known fighter dogs include Bubloo, Moon, Heera, Moti, Doggar, Koka, Shankar, Kaala and Jockey.

Mohammad Bashir, who attends dog fights regularly, told Dawn that some dog owners either rub bitter tasting ointments on their dogs so other dogs would not hold their bite for long, oil so they cannot get a grip and sometimes even poison to kill rival dogs.

That is why two referees are tasked with properly washing the dogs before they are allowed to fight, he said.

Dog fighting has been prohibited by the district administration and the police.

The hosts of these events organise them in secret, deep inside forests and other remote locations. Those attending the event are never given an exact location and are given the address to a neighbouring location.

The matches continue from morning till sunset and are filmed so they can be uploaded on social media, where they are avidly followed.

",1/15/2019,"RAWALPINDI: Eighty pilgrims were stopped from boarding a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight for Umrah because their seats had not been confirmed, but half of them were allowed to travel after their travel agent paid for their tickets.

PIA spokesperson Mashood Tajwar told Dawn that a travel agent from Lahore had booked the pilgrimsâ seats but did not pay for their confirmation in time, leading to the cancellation of their bookings.

He added that the travel agency was a defaulter that owed the PIA Rs25 million, but had sought a temporary stay order from a senior civil judge.

The court had also ordered the agency to pay the PIA.

Mr Tajwar said the passengersâ tickets were only cancelled because the travel agent did not pay for them.

Half the pilgrims were allowed to travel after agent paid for their seats

He said the travel agent had also involved a sub-agent who dealt with the pilgrims.

The pilgrims, who were from Lakki Marwat, were to travel from Islamabad to Jeddah on PIA flight PK-741, but were not permitted to board because their seats were not confirmed.

They were told by PIA staff that their bookings were cancelled because their travel agent did not pay for the tickets in time.

Mr Tajwar said 40 of the pilgrims were allowed to travel once the travel agent paid for their tickets.

He blamed the agent for inconveniencing the pilgrims, and claimed the PIA administrationâs timely actions

had saved the airline from fraud. PK-741 took off at 8:45am.

Separately, a passenger travelling to Ras Al Khaimah was injured from falling on the escalator while heading to the passenger lounge at Islamabad International Airport.

Sources said Sheikh Mohammad Hussain, 83, slipped and fell down the escalator, injuring his forehead. The passenger received first aid from a Civil Aviation Authorty doctor and was allowed to travel.

",1/15/2019,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development joined the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration in an operation to retrieve 102 kanals in Valley Zone V belonging to the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) that had been occupied since 1999.

Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Overseas Pakistanis Syed Zulfikar Bukhari supervised the operation alongside Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat.

Mr Bukhari told the press: âThe writ of the state will be established at all costs and those involved in grabbing land belonging to Pakistani expatriates will be taken to task as per law.â

He added: âWe will not tolerate such an illegal activity and in this regard measures are being taken to avoid reoccupation of the stateâs land by the mafia.â

Mr Bukhari said a boundary wall will be constructed around the valley and police pickets will be set up as well. The concerned ministry will also ensure that the area is monitored so it cannot be occupied again.

According to a ministry spokesperson, the valley, spread over 5,000 kanals, was approved in 1999 and 90pc of the allotments have already been made.

The retrieved land will also be allotted to overseas Pakistanis based on merit.

Mr Bukhari told this agency that Pakistani

expatriates were constantly raising the issue of their occupied property in the country, and complaints statistics had also shown that this was a major issue facing expats.

In this regard, he said the ministry is planning to set up a fast-track court in the capital to retrieve expatriatesâ property from land grabbers. The court aims to provide instant relief to litigants, as the number of such cases is gradually increasing.

âAccordingly, a summary has been submitted to the Ministry of Law and Justice to materialise the initiative during the current year,â he said.

The special court will be designed to ensure the disposal of cases within a month after the admittance of petitions, he said, adding that it will be established after the necessary legislation with full constitutional cover.

Mr Bukhari said both ministries will meet next week to discuss the technical and legal issues facing overseas Pakistanis in the prevailing judicial system and the setting up of the aforementioned court.

The establishment of the court will serve as a pilot project, on the basis of which similar courts would then be set up in other cities, he said.

",1/15/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Two Capital Development Authority (CDA) directorates are at loggerheads over who is responsible for controlling unauthorised construction in the city.

More than a hundred housing societies are operating illegally in Islamabad, and most of them have taken over land reserved for graveyards, schools and other civic amenities, creating problems for people who have built homes there because timely action was not taken against their operators.

In a letter, the housing societies directorate recently asked building control to take action against sponsors of illegal housing schemes and against schemes whose layouts were cancelled.

Pointing out illegal societies in zones II and V and in E-11, the housing societies directorate asked various organisations to take action against housing society operators.

In response, the directorate of building control II on Monday said the issue of housing societies needed to be quelled on solid grounds in a practical way.

List of illegal housing schemes may be referred to DC, spokesperson says

In a letter, Deputy Director Usman Rasheed Khan said that under zoning regulations, after the clearance of the no-objection certificate, every sponsor of a society must seek approval of engineering design and specifications of utility services from the director general planning.

Authorised CDA officers are also to inspect the site during the development of the scheme and record their observations.

The letter stated: âMajor issue in housing schemes is that they have developed their scheme/society in complete deviation of approved layout plan and majority of societies has no obtained NOC from CDA. The question now arises that how they have undertaken the infrastructure work without obtaining NOC form the CDA and if they have obtained necessary approval from the CDA then how they developed in complete deviation of approved LOP.â

The construction of buildings comes later, the letter said, adding that if the aforementioned system had been in place âthis whole mess would not have been createdâ.

The official wrote that if the society had been properly supervised by the concerned CDA officers when infrastructure was being developed, ensuring that housing societies and schemes were being developed according to their approved layout plans and no deviations had taken place âthen no violation at site would occurâ.

The building control letter advised the housing societies directorate to ensure that CDA officers visit schemes that are now in the construction stage to check whether infrastructure is being developed according to engineering standards and, if this system is in place, they would make sure development is carried out according to the approved layout plan.

The letter also referenced various regulations that empower the housing societies directorate to deal with societies that violate layout plans. It added that building control II was established in 2017 to exercise building control in approved housing societies âbut unfortunately no requisite staff has yet been posted despite various effortsâ.

It added that the understaffed directorate could not carry out fieldwork to check unauthorised construction, and also called for a complete ban on construction in illegal housing societies.

CDA spokesperson Safdar Shah said the list of all illegal housing schemes may be referred to the deputy commissioner for the imposition of section 144 to ban construction in the limits of the Islamabad Capital Territory.

He said the CDA was not restricted to just issued notices, and action has been taken against the operators of several housing societies.

",1/15/2019,"LAHORE: A group of lawyers representing Faisalabad Regional Police Officer Ghulam Mahmood Dogar on Monday audaciously manhandled a man from the opposite party in the court of an additional district and sessions judge hearing an appeal of the RPO against the alleged illegal shifting of his children from Pakistan by his Canadian national wife.

During the hearing, the police officerâs lawyers, who were over a dozen in number, kept abusing and provoking Waseem Ijaz, a guarantor in the childrenâs custody matter on behalf of their Canadian mother Mirjam Aberras Lahdeaho, despite repeated warnings by AD&SJ Adnan Tariq.

Senior lawyer Hina Jillani represented Mr Ijaz.

Soon after Ms Jillani and Mr Dogarâs counsel Syed Ali Hassan concluded their arguments, the aggressive lawyers pounced upon Mr Ijaz and started roughing him up in the presence of the judge, slapping him in the face and punching him ruthlessly.

The lawyers also manhandled Muhammad Akram, an office-assistant of Ms Jillani and snatched his mobile phone when he tried to make a footage of the violence using its camera.

The judge was shocked to see the violence as his efforts to calm down the lawyers failed.

Ms Jillani and her associates rescued both Mr Ejaz and Mr Akram from the lawyers.

Meanwhile, the judge left for his chamber to dictate the decision of the proceedings.

Earlier, in his arguments, Mr Dogarâs counsel took a plea that the Canadian lady took away the children with her unlawfully.

He said Mr Ejaz had deposited surety bonds before a guardian court when the custody of the minors was given to the mother.

He argued that the guarantor was responsible, under the law, to ensure production of the minors before the court.

He also argued that the court could not proceed on the appeal of the father without the production of the children.

He said Mr Ejaz also possessed Canadian passport and there was a possibility that he would also abscond.

The counsel asked the court to take custody of Mr Ejazâs passport and also place order placing of his name on exit control list (ECL).

Mr Dogar told the court that the passports of the children were with him but their mother got them removed with âcriminal assistanceâ of the Canadian Embassy.

On the other side, Ms Jillani argued that the guarantor was not supposed to ensure production of the respondentâs children as the surety deposited by him was meant for obtaining guardianship certificate from the guardian court.

She said the court should have issued a notice to the mother of the children instead of issuing arrest warrants of the guarantor.

After hearing the arguments, the judge directed Mr Ejaz to surrender his passport with the court and ensure production of the minors on Jan 24.

Ms Lahdeaho had arrived in Pakistan last year to get custody of her children back, with a claim that her police officer husband brought them from Canada to Pakistan secretly and unlawfully. Mr Dogar had produced the minors â Qasim Dogar (17) and Jaffer Dogar (13) -- before the Lahore High Court after she filed a habeas corpus petition.

Ms Lahdeaho, who also embraced Islam and was given a Muslim name Maryam, said she married Dogar on March 6, 1997, in Lahore and stayed in Pakistan for over 12 years along with three children before moving to Canada as permanent residents in 2009. Zahra Dogar, 19, was their third child.

The lady had flown back to Canada on June 16, 2018, after a guardian court decided the custody of children in her favour.

",1/15/2019,"LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly session on Monday saw the treasury and the opposition developing consensus on multiple legislative work.

Both the treasury and the opposition unanimously adopted amendment to the rules of procedure of the Punjab Assembly house empowering the speaker to issue production order of an MPA detained by the law enforcement agencies.

The house also adopted the Punjab Right to Public Services Bill of 2018, while two other bills - the Punjab Domestic Workers Bill of 2018 and the Punjab Prevention of Conflict of Interest Bill of 2018- were postponed by the speaker until January 21 on the request of the opposition.

Opposition Leader Hamza Shahbaz led the opposition, which of late has turned hostile towards the speaker for expelling their six members for hooliganism in the house. On Monday, they praised Speaker Pervaiz Elahi for listening to their concerns on the two deferred bills and for amending the rules to bring PML-N MPA Khawaja Salman Rafique (who is in the National Accountability Bureauâs custody in Paragon City scam) to the house.

Mr Elahi, however, asked Mr Shahbaz to also thank Chief Minister Usman Buzdar for these developments.

Mr Shahbaz said: âWe are political workers and always appreciated the good work.â He said the rule of issuing production order for a detained MPA was functional in the other three provincial assemblies and now the Punjab Assembly also joined them. He requested the speaker to issue the production order of Mr Rafique.

Following the oppositionâs serious concerns over the Punjab Domestic Workers Bill of 2018, the chair said there were chances of misuse of the bill if adopted without addressing certain matters.

âI suggest the treasury engage the opposition, experts and the general public before finalising the draft to be tabled in the assembly next Monday,â the speaker said.

PML-Nâs MPAs Malik Ahmad, Khalil Tahir Sandhu, Azma Bokhari, Waris Kalu, Dr Mazhar Iqbal and Bilal Atta Tarar raised objections to the domestic workers bill, saying that everybody wanted the protection of the rights of the domestic workers but at the same time did not want exploitation of the new law to be used against employers.

Although Law Minister Basharat Raja argued that the bill addressed the objections of the opposition, the speaker insisted that the house should not adopt such law in a haste as it might spoil the reputation of someone if anything went wrong.

âWe should welcome oppositionâs suggestions as these will be fruitful for the new legislation,â the speaker said.

Former Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana Iqbal took strong exception to the comments of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insafâs Mian Aslam Iqbal that he (Rana Iqbal) would run the house on the instruction of his boss Shahbaz Sharif and never accommodated the opposition in the past. Malik Ahmad asked the chair to expunge Aslam Iqbalâs comments. Earlier, the speaker expunged Azma Bokhariâs remarks calling Imran Khan âselected prime ministerâ.

PPP Parliamentary Leader Hasan Murtaza staged walkout for not taking the opposition on board in the Punjab Right to Public Services Bill of 2018. PTIâs Chaudhry Zaheeruddin persuaded him to end the boycott and return to the House.

Chief Minister Buzdar joined the house only for a few minutes.

",1/15/2019,"THATTA: A two-member reactive mission of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) is to visit the Makli necropolis next week to ascertain whether the 15 recommendations of the UNâs specialised agency for better maintenance of the heritage site were implemented or not.

The reactive mission would specially visit the 15th century shrine of Jam Nizamuddin-II alias Jam Nindo (1443-1509) which had deveÂ­lÂ­oÂ­pÂ­ed wide cracks and is crumbling.

The visiting team of experts comprising Hayashi Nao and Jonathan Stanhope will prepare an exclusive report which is to be presented at Unescoâs next annual meeting, scheduled for June-July 2019 at Baku, Azerbaijan.

At last yearâs meeting, held in Poland, followed by a recent meeting in Bahrain, Unesco had warÂ­ned the government of Pakistan that if required steps were not taken towards conservation of the site as per international standards and the 15 recommendations were not followed, the Makli necropolis could be de-listed as an endangered World Heritage Site.

World Heritage Site faces risk of losing âendangeredâ status

Besides the Jam Nindo tomb, the reactive team would inspect construction of the outer boundary wall of the necropolis and ascertain what measures had been taken to prevent unauthorised burials within the precinct of the heritage site.

A meeting of the archaeology departmentâs steering committee was held recently under the chairmanship of Manzoor Kanasro, the director general of antiquities and culture. Thatta Deputy CommisÂ­sioÂ­ner Usman Tanveer, consultant (archaeology) Qazi Ayaz, Makli necropolis conservator Sarfaraz Ahmed Jatoi, Nawaz Jatoi and Dr Mohammad Ali Manjhi, a historian and former director general of the culture department, attended the meeting.

It discussed threadbare various issues pertaining to the heritage site with reference to the Unesco reactive missionâs visit, tentatively scheduled for Jan 20-22.

The meeting decided to strictly implement the recommendations including stopping fresh burials in any part of the necropolis.

It noted that an alternative burial site had been earmarked for the local population.

Conservator Jatoi told Dawn that recently, structural engineers, architects and conservationists Mr Matthias from GermÂ­any and Mr Rand Eppich from Spain had visited the site and conducted geotechnical studies of the monumental shrine on behalf of Unesco with a view to protecting the heritage site. They have alreÂ­ady submitted their reports to Unesco.

It also discussed measures for early completion of the necropolisâs outer boundary and beefed up security at the site.

Former director general of archÂ­aÂ­eÂ­ology Qasim Ali Qasim has, meanwhile, observed that Unesco was seriously concerned over the state of the Jam Nindo monument, which had been included in the master plan of the archaeology department.

He pointed out that when the position of the tombâs columns was measured, it emerged that the 33-foot-tall structure with an equal size of plinth had tilted by seven inches which was quite alarming.

",1/15/2019,"SANGHAR: An alleged raid by Rangers personnel on the house of Sorath Lohar, convener of the Voice for Missing Persons of Sindh (VMPS), triggered a series of protest demonstrations in Karachi, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas and some other parts of the province.

It was alleged that a Rangersâ team raided her house and took away her 17-year-old brother, Singhar, apparently for questioning over some matter relating to the ongoing campaign for what is being called ârecovery of enforced disappearance victimsâ.

There has been no word so far from the Rangersâ personnel about the alleged raid.

Soon after the alleged raid, a number of civil society and nationalist activists held a protest demonstration at Shaheed Chowk in Khipro town of Sanghar district on Sunday.

They said Sorath Lohar had been playing an active role in the campaign as she believed that her father, who had gone missing some two years back, was also a victim of enforced disappearance. Most such victims appeared to be political and nationalist activists, they said.

The protesters described the alleged raid as an attempt to suppress the campaign and gag her voice. They demanded action against the personnel involved in the raid.

Similar demonstrations were held in Karachi and Hyderabad on Sunday and Monday.

MIRPURKHAS: A large number of activists belonging to the Sindh United Party (SUP), Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM) and its Arisar faction, Pakistan Peoples Party-Shaheed Bhutto (PPP-SB) and civil society organisations held a demonstration on Monday outside the local press club to condemn the alleged raid.

They claimed that Ms Lohar, her sister Sassui Lohar and mother were harassed by the raiding team.

Led by SUP activist Manzoor Ahmed Memon, the protesters raised slogans against the raid and demanded appropriate action for the recovery of all victims of enforced disappearance.

They also vowed to foil all attempts to suppress the campaign launched by the VMPS.

They noted with concern that the raiding team picked up Ms Loharâs teenage brother and appealed to the Sindh Rangers director general to take notice of the action.

HYDERABAD: Civil society activists, including Mushtaq Mirani, Ali Palh advocate, Aslam Baloch, Zulfikar Halepoto, Punhal Sario and Suleman Abro, held a press conference here on Monday to condemn the raid.

They said that Sorath and Sassui were struggling for the recovery of their father. Punhal Sario said that it was their right to seek recovery of their father and other missing persons. He demanded that all such persons be produced before court.

Ali Palh advocate, who is also an activist of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, observed that those at the helm of affairs must know what was happening in the country and thatâs why they were raising this issue. âAs members of civil society, we cannot remain indifferent if someone goes missing,â he said.

",1/15/2019,"KARACHI: Local GoveÂ­rnÂ­ment Minister Saeed Ghani has said that the federal governmentâs âhastyâ decision to put 172 persons named in the report of a joint investigation team (JIT) formed by the Supreme Court on the Exit Control List (ECL) suggested that it was actually a conspiracy to topple the Sindh government.

The minister said this while talking to the media after the session of the Sindh Assembly on Monday.

To a question, he said that the JIT had overstepped its authority by recommending in its report the names for their inclusion on the ECL. He said it was not his viewpoint, but it was the observation of the chief justice of Pakistan since the JIT was tasked to investigate the allegations and submit its report.

He asked whether the government had constituted any committee for including the names on the ECL or whether the Supreme Court had given orders to the federal government to do so.

In reply to another question, the LG minister said that objections were being raised on the capabilities and performance of the National Accountability Bureau ever since it was constituted.

He said during all previous governments, including the then Pakistan Peoples Party-led government, NAB had been politically victimising the PPP and even today it was being used by the government against his party.

Regarding Prime Minister Imran Khan and Information Minister Fawad Chaudhryâs upcoming visit to Sindh, Mr Ghani said that unfortunately Mr Khan was a âselected prime ministerâ who could visit Sindh by all means but Mr Chaudhry was not even recognised by his own party members so what could he say about him.

",1/15/2019,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was informed during Question Hour on Monday that ostrich was not defined as a protected bird under the provincial wildlife laws and its farming was allowed under relevant laws.

Furnishing a statement on the floor, Forest and Wildlife Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said that a special permission for ostrich farming was required to be obtained from the provincial authorities as for poultry farming.

He said that a private farm had been established in Thatta for ostrich farming.

In reply to a question, he said that the Rs150.97 million project of rehabilitation and improvement of wildlife sanctuaries at the Haleji Lake, Langh Lake, Thatta and Qambar could not be completed owing to paucity of funds, and added that it would be completed in June.

He said that different jobs at the Haleji Lake, including liner plantation along the inspection path, development of floating mounts, development of a pelican island, restoration of historical information centres, development of the fun area for children, restoration and repair of lavatories, restoration of the crocodile enclosure, installation of a wireless system, and construction of floating rooms, had been carried out.

In reply to another question asked by opposition member Nusrat Sehar Abbasi, the minister said that a Rs50m project for habitat restoration and development of water harvesting facilities at the KNP, Karachi, and Jamshoro was expected to be completed by June 2019.

However, he added, the projectâs date of completion had been extended by two years because of paucity of funds.

Answering a question by opposition member Arif Mustafa Jatoi, the minister said the Pai Forest in Shaheed Benazirabad had been declared a game reserve.

He said that hunting was not allowed in the Pai Forest, but the government was empowered to relax the rules and issue permits for hunting in special cases.

In reply to another question, Mr Shah furnished details of the year-wise allocation and utilisation of the budget for plantation and rehabilitation of forests during the past five years.

The minister said Rs612m was allocated in 2017-18.

Giving answer to a question, he said that the local fishermen were catching Indus blind dolphin as previously the Sindh fisheries department was issuing fishing permits for the catch.

He said that the population of the endangered species had remarkably increased since 2014 when the issuance of fishing licences by the SFD was finally stopped with efforts of the Sindh wildlife department.

The minister also told the house on a question by opposition member Arsalan Taj Hussain that 12 different species were declared endangered in the province. They were: Sindh ibex, Afghan urial, Indian wolf, honey badger, mugger, or marsh crocodile, gharial, or gavial, smooth-coated Indian otter, Indus blind dolphin, greater flamingo, freshwater turtles, hog deer (axis porcinus) and chinkara deer.

He said that several steps had been taken to conserve the endangered species. The steps, he said, included the establishment of a series of protected areas such as National Park, 34 wildlife sanctuaries and 13 game reserves for protection, conservation and management of endangered wildlife species.

Besides, the minister said, the Sindh Turtles and Tortoise Protection, Conservation and Compensation Rules 2014 had been enacted to ensure the conservation and protection of turtles in the province.

93,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457589/air-pollution-termed-greatest-environmental-threat-to-health,"Air pollution termed greatest environmental threat to health
",1/15/2019,"KARACHI: Describing air pollution as the worldâs single biggest environmental health risk, experts at a three-day international conference, which concluded at Karachi University (KU) on Sunday, called for collaborative research efforts to determine the impact of specific sources of air pollution on human health.

They were speaking at the fifth international conference on âEnvironmental horizon, sounding the alarm! Environment, climate change and healthâ organised by KUâs department of chemistry and Office of Research Innovation and Commercialisation (ORIC), and International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS).

Sharing global concerns on air pollution, Dr Haider A. Khwaja from Wadsworth Centre at the School of Public Health of University at Albany in New York, said that air pollution was a serious public health issue the world over as population-based studies had documented health risks resulting from short-term exposure to air pollutants.

âThe World Health Organisation reports that in 2012 around seven million people died â one in eight of total global deaths â due to exposure to air pollution. This data confirms that air pollution is now the worldâs largest single environmental health risk,â he noted.

He said that the South Asian and Western Pacific regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012 with 2.6m deaths linked to outdoor air pollution and 3.3m deaths related to indoor pollution, according to WHO.

A significant number of these deaths, he said, occurred due to stroke and cardiopulmonary diseases. These findings were not based on a significant increase in pollution but rather on improved knowledge of the links between air pollutants and cardiopulmonary diseases.

Dr James J. Schauer, a senior civil and environmental engineer heading the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the association of atmospheric particulate matter particles with adverse health effects had been well established and led experts to develop standards on these pollutants and implement control measures.

According to him, different strategies can be used in air pollution control programmes to reduce the impact of particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, given the complex nature of the sources of these pollutants.

He emphasised the need for collaborative efforts between atmospheric science studies and epidemiological and toxicological studies to establish how specific sources of air pollution were affecting human health.

Sheryl H. Ehrman from Davidson College of Engineering, San Jose State University, USA, informed the audience that anthropogenic pollutants had been successfully reduced in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, resulting in improved air quality.

However, she said that parts of the mid-Atlantic were still non-attainment regions (areas which are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards as defined in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 of the United States).

The ozone, she pointed out, was a secondary air pollutant, formed by reactions between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Ozone precursors were mainly emitted by power plants, motor vehicles, industrial operations and biogenic sources.

âIn the past several years, a new influx of emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing-based production of natural gas in the Marcellus Shale (the largest gas field in the US) may be counteracting the benefits that have been gained. On the flip side, low-cost natural gas could replace coal as fuel for power plants, potentially reducing emissions,â she observed.

Another speaker, Parisa A. Ariya of the department of chemistry and department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, shared that the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and WHO had identified airborne particles as a research priority of the utmost importance.

She said the IPCC pointed to the importance of aerosol-cloud processes due to their impacts on the absorption and scattering of irradiation, altering the earthâs climate whereas WHO predominantly considered aerosols to be health hazards.

Former federal minister for science and technology Atta-ur-Rahman spoke about how progress in science and technology had dramatically changed socio-economic conditions in different countries.

Director ICCBS Prof M. Iqbal Choudhary said biodiversity was a manifestation of chemical diversity and plants contained a fascinating array of highly evolved, specific and effective gene products.

",1/15/2019,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court-mandated commission on water and sanitation in Sindh on Monday directed the local government secretary to hold a meeting with authorities concerned regarding public parks and submit a report about the feasibility of a scheme to convert sewage into grey water for gardening.

The commission, headed by retired Justice Amir Hani Muslim, gave one month to the LG secretary to file his report.

Justice Muslim visited the Fateh Park in North Nazimabad on Jan 12 on the request of the chairman of the district municipal corporation Central, where a registered society had introduced a scheme, Green Initiative, for converting sewage into grey water, which could be utilised for any purposes other than human consumption.

The commission said that not only the park in question, but other areas could also benefit through treated water.

DMC Central chairman Rehan Hashmi informed the commission that he introduced this scheme and was also planning to initiate it in different parks within the district.

The commission said that such schemes could make a huge difference if introduced in big parks and would also ease pressure on potable water as grey water can be utilised for gardening and maintenance of green patches.

It observed that the provincial government was required to examine the feasibility of converting sewage into grey water.

",1/15/2019,"KARACHI: Following a debate on extreme delays in awarding funds through a new National Finance Commission (NFC), the Sindh Assembly on Monday unanimously demanded that the federal government announce the NFC shares to the provinces in the next award.

Members of the Sindh Assembly, which met here with Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani in the chair, spoke for more than two hours in the debate allowed after the house admitted an adjournment motion moved by Pakistan Peoples Partyâs Nida Khuhro last week.

As the debate ended, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Chawla tabled a motion calling the Sindh government to approach the federal government asking it to announce the NFC shares to the provinces.

The motion was unanimously passed. Members of opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan were present in the house but no lawmaker belonging to the Grand Democratic Alliance was present.

The members referred to Article 160 of the Constitution, according to which the president would notify the NFC award after every five years.

Lawmakers question Punjabâs biggest share

The current seventh NFC award gave 42.5 per cent of the divisible pool of taxes to the federal government. The remaining 57.5pc was distributed among the provinces â Punjab got 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc and Balochistan 9.09pc.

The members questioned the current multiple criteria under which Punjab took the largest share although it was Sindh that contributed up to 70pc to the total kitty.

A minister wants fundsâ distribution on the basis of population factor decreased

They said population was still the dominant factor in awarding the NFC, which stood at 82pc. The share for backwardness, poverty and revenue collection was 5pc, 10.3pc and 2.7pc.

Education and Culture Minister Sardar Shah said it was time to reduce the share based on population to a significant level and other criteria should be given more share.

He said the NFC award was not just an issue for the Sindh government or the ruling PPP, but it involved the whole province for which all political parties in Sindh should get united and launch a struggle for the benefit of the people.

âNo matter you belong to the PTI, MQM or any other party, we all belong to Sindh and we have to speak for the rights of Sindh,â he said.

He said out of a total area of 140,000 square kilometres of Sindh, just 34pc of it was irrigated by barrages and linked to canal systems; and two-thirds of Sindh equally deserved to be developed at par with the rest.

âTo develop such remote vast swathes we need money, we need funds,â he said, adding that the reduction in the population criterion and increase in other factors would benefit Sindh and Balochistan.

He referred to the PTI leadershipâs mantra of âNaya Pakistanâ, saying a new Pakistan could only be possible by abiding by the Constitution.

Mover Nida Khuhro said the way the Centre was âvictimisingâ Sindh for electing the PPP again, the NFC should now be called âNo Funds Coming Awardâ.

She said like the previous government of Nawaz Sharif, the PTI government was not sincere in giving NFC award on time.

She said the federal government had not paid Rs90 billion to Sindh, which forced the provincial government to cut its development budget.

Ms Khuhro said instead of provinces, the federal government should award 3pc from its share to erstwhile Fata. âSuch decisions are blatant violations of the Constitution. Neither the prime minister nor the cabinet can take such decisions without amending the Constitution.â

Opposition asks PPP to give a âjustâ PFC award

All the opposition members supported the treasury memberâs adjournment motion, yet they pressed on their demand that the funds coming to provinces should further be channelled to the third tier of government as well.

MQM-Pâs Khwaja Izharul Hasan appreciated the fiscal policy teams of the PPP and the MQM, which succeeded in changing the NFC formula in recent years, which was earlier singularly based on the population criterion.

He, however, said Karachi was Sindhâs capital and its greatest revenue producer, yet the megacity was not receiving its due share from the provincial exchequer.

Khwaja Izhar said the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) in Sindh constituted by the government was not formed justly.

PTIâs parliamentary party leader Haleem Adil Shaikh blamed the provincial government for sending nomination for its member in the NFC after three months despite several reminders sent by Islamabad.

He said it was the Sindh government which should be blamed for a delayed constitution of the NFC.

He also demanded the PFC award claiming that the Sindh government had spent just 15pc of the development budget in the past six months while it allowed Rs391bn meant for development to lapse in the past nine years.

GDAâs Nusrat Abbasi also demanded the formation of the PFC award.

PPPâs Taimur Talpur said it was then president Asif Zardari who gave greater share to the provinces through a progressive NFC award.

GDAâs Arif Jatoi said former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had set up the NFC award based only on the population basis.

MQM-Pâs Mohammad Hussain said Sindh had been a victim of the Centreâs âbiasedâ attitude both in the NFC share and the PSDP.

He said all the lawmakers belonging to Sindh from parliament and the provincial assembly should register their protest in Islamabad jointly.

He added that the provincial government should ensure a just PFC award for every district of Sindh.

Jawaid Hanif, Ghanwar Isran, Omar Umari, Abdul Rasheed and Qasim Siraj also spoke.

The house passed The Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma Karachi Bill, 2018 unanimously. The bill was duly amended and recommended by the select committee.

An adjournment motion moved by PPPâs Sadia Jawed was admitted about the Karachi Circular Railway and a debate regarding the federal governmentâs promise was fixed for Thursday.

Five calling-attention notices by Haleem Shaikh, Riaz Haider, Marui Rashdi, Nusrat Abbasi and Mangla Sharma were responded to by the ministers concerned.

",1/15/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Leaders of some Balochistan-based political parties on Monday threatened to hold a protest during the expected visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Gwadar next month.

Independent MNA MohaÂ­mÂ­mad Aslam Bhootani from Gwadar and leader of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) Agha Hassan Baloch from Quetta criticised the federal government for ânot taking elected representatives into confidenceâ regarding deveÂ­lÂ­opment activities being carried out in Balochistan, particularly in Gwadar.

Take a look: Balochistan cabinet shocked by CPEC presentation

âWe will tell the Saudi prince that Balochistan is not for sale and that elected representatives of the port city have not been taken on board regarding the development activities,â Mr Bhootani, who sits on the treasury bench, said while speaking in the National Assembly.

âWe will not allow any investment in Gwadar if we are bypassed,â he added.

According to media reports, the Saudi prince is expected to visit next month and would lay the foundation stone of a Saudi oil refinery in Gwadar.

Mr Bhootani said that elected MNAs and MPAs would also meet the Saudi ambassador in Pakistan and apprise him about their concerns.

He said earlier projects worth $62 billion were announced for Gwadar but the local representatives did not know where that money had been spent.

âNow we hear that Saudi Arabia is setting up an oil refinery in Gwadar but again the people of the port city have not been taken into confidence,â he regretted.

Mr Bhootani said not only him but elected representatives of the BNP-M were also not consulted regarding development projects in Balochistan.

National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser urged the MNA not to make a hue and cry as investment in Gwadar was a âsensitiveâ matter.

Agha Hassan Baloch of the BNP-M said that although his party was an ally of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in the centre, it was also kept in the dark regarding development activities in BalochÂ­istan and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.

âWe are not against development activities in Balochistan, but the people of the province are disappÂ­ointed over being ignored,â he said.

âWe did not get anything from the CPEC and now we are being bypassed again,â the BNP-M leader added.

âInstead of being unanswerable to international agencies, the ADPs (annual development plans of the provinces) and PSDPs (public sector development programmes of the Centre) should be based on needs of the local peopleâ to be responsive to basic human requirements, she said, adding that the funds should not be given to MNAs and MPAs to spend here and there on untargeted programmes without measuring outcomes.

She said the PTI government would have to change the definition of development budget from mega infrastructure like roads and building projects and shift the focus of spending directly on the people by addressing root causes of poverty and hunger.

Kanwal says 18th Amendment does not mean allowing provinces to become âstates within the stateâ

Giving an example of just one hospital of Bahawalpur in south Punjab, Ms Shauzab said a total of 1,380,000 patients visited the outpatient department (OPD) and 85pc of them were referred to dialysis centre, which meant the quality of water and nutrition conditions of the country were to blame.

She said motorways passed through the area, but the people on both sides did not have the access road to reach the hospital or take their produce to the market.

In such conditions, she said, the people of the area were demanding hospitals and more dialysis machines. The need under the SDGs should be to address the water quality and ensure its supply to all to eradicate water-borne diseases rather than only building hospitals because by the time a hospital became operational the need for 10 more hospitals would arise.

She said the objective of the SDGs should not be to leave anybody behind and problems of poverty, hunger and nutrition should be addressed on a top priority basis. The imported agenda of SDGs would not resolve the issue of poverty and hence the SDG targets should be reframed in the light of local conditions.

Ms Shauzab said reprioritisation of development programmes should be done to achieve social sector goals, but there were interest groups everywhere that promoted foreign-sponsored agendas and projects.

She said the Voluntary National Review (VNR) for SDGs would be ready by June this year as work was under way in consultation with all stakeholders for achieving desired goals under the SDGs. But, she added, Pakistan had not yet worked out the exact financing requirement attached to achieve the SDGs and to achieve these goals without the commitment from the international community for financing seemed really too much ambitious.

She said the people of the country were missing from development priorities as infrastructure development was the top priority at a time when human development conditions were showing prevalence of an alarming situation.

Ms Shauzab said the Planning Commission was working on developing civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) for identification of 30 per cent gap in âour data to help achieve the SDGs by 2030â.

She said that CRVS was the compulsory, continuous, universal and permanent recording of all vital events such as birth and death. From these records, vital statistics on birth, death, cause of death, fertility and mortality (where migration data is also available) could be produced for policy and planning.

It could help in connecting data from birth registration to all important events of all individualsâ life for achieving the SDG targets and tracking all other requirements and obligations.

Ms Shauzab said that it was impossible to achieve the SDGs when acute poverty prevailed in several parts of the country, especially in south Punjab and interior of Sindh.

In reply to a question about the cost for achieving the SDGs, the parliamentary secretary said that work was under way along with stakeholders, but being a signatory to all goals on behalf of Pakistan, the federal government would have to re-prioritise the development requirements even after the enactment of the 18th Amendment.

",1/15/2019,"KARACHI: The worldâs youngest Nobel Prize laureate and education activist Malala Yousafzai on Monday revealed that she had a photo of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in her room at Oxford University.

In a brief interview with the BBC, the 21-year-old activist spoke about what she does in between writing and university life.

âI think for relaxing it's just spending time with friends, playing cricket or just having a bit of gossip or just going for lunch,â she said. Malala, who is starting her second year at Oxford University studying philosophy, politics and economics, has often talked about her love for cricket. âWhen I say I love cricket, Iâm not that good,â she quickly added.

Asked what the Nobel Prize winner did for fun, Ms Yousafzai expressed her liking for British comedy and sitcoms. âI recently watched the Blackadder. Sometimes I watch Yes, Minister and I also like the show Mind Your Language which I know wouldnât be welcome the same way it was but I find it funny,â she said.

In terms of her university room and how she fares on keeping it clean, the global icon said her mother tells her off for being untidy. âI am not a big fan of posters, but I have a photo of Benazir Bhutto in my room,â she added.

Benazir Bhutto, who became Pakistanâs first female prime minister in 1988, had also attained an undergraduate degree from Oxfordâs Lady Margaret Hall in the subjects of philosophy, economics and politics.

On Jan 8, Malalaâs latest book We are Displaced: My Journey and Stories from Refugee Girls Around the World was released worldwide. In the latest title, Ms Yousafzai tells her own story and shares the journeys of other young female refugees whoâve been forced from their homes.

âWe hear about refugees and immigrants but we never hear from them, especially from young women and girls,â she told the BBC explaining why she wrote the book.

Ms Yousafzai, who belongs to Swat, has been living in Birmingham, UK, since October 2012. Speaking about her own experience of settling in the country as an immigrant, she said: âIn the beginning, it was very difficult. But, then I realised when you take a step forward and try to talk to people, it helps.â

âNow Iâm proudly Brummie as well,â she quipped.

",1/15/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar said on Monday that the Supreme Court had never exceeded its limits and that the people of the country had confidence in the apex court.

Addressing the launching ceremony of the Police Reforms Committeeâs report â âPolice Reforms: Way Forwardâ â organised by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP), he said the Supreme Court had disposed of 85 per cent cases and provided relief to people.

Explore: Judicial overreach?

He said people wanted positive change and the rule of law in the country. He said that every action he had taken as CJP was within the parameter of the law, adding that he had never exceeded his constitutional mandate.

The CJP said the police reforms constituted an integral part of the criminal justice system reforms. Since the independence of the country about two dozen reform initiatives had been undertaken, however, desired results could not be achieved, he added.

Justice Nisar says relief has been provided to people by apex court

He emphasised the importance of the rule of law and an efficient criminal justice system in society. He stated that the police had a crucial role in protecting the right to a fair trial and in the prevention and investigation of crimes.

According to the CJP, an effective police force is one that is assisted by the community they serve as people are confident that justice will be done.

He stressed that the existing criminal justice system urgently required reforms as a whole. Especially upgrade of the law for governance and management is required to ensure a neutral, responsive, accountable and transparent police force. The police force could only function efficiently when they were given administrative, operational and financial autonomy, he added.

CJP Nisar said that the Police Reforms Committee was established with the objective of an independent and impartial police force and its recommendations were very useful because they outline the duties of police officers, the separation of investigation procedures and composition of the Commission to promote transparency.

He stated that by implementing these recommendations, trust deficit between police and public would decrease and it would create a competent, efficient and responsive police force.

The CJP applauded efforts and contribution of members of the Police Reforms Committee, saying that they worked day and night to complete the report.

In his concluding remarks, CJP Nisar stressed the need for de-politicising the police to develop public confidence in the system. He stressed that there was a need to pinpoint lacunae in investigation resulting in the acquittal of criminals.

Report on police reforms

A steering committee headed by Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court and the designated chief justice of Pakistan, worked on the implementation of recommendations.

The convener of the Police Reforms Committee and former inspector general of Sindh Police, Afzal Ali Shigri, stated that performance of police was directly linked to the delivery of justice and performance of judiciary and criminal justice system.

He said in the past several efforts had been made to improve the performance of the criminal justice system. But, he added, the current initiative had the distinction that it was taken by the Supreme Court.

Mr Shigri said after formation of the Police Reforms Committee intensive deliberations and discussion were held within the committee. He said the report contained feasible and practical proposals on matters, like the redressal of grievances and improvement in the quality of investigation.

Mr Shigri also presented the report on police reforms to CJP Nisar.

The report recommends certain measures, such as establishment of âcomplaint redressal mechanismâ at the office of the city police officer headed by an officer of additional inspector general rank in provinces and deputy inspector general in Islamabad.

It stresses the need of imparting best training to police officers, revamping urban policing and introducing forum for alternative dispute resolution (ADR).

",1/14/2019,"The police on Monday set free their four colleagues who were found to be ânegligentâ a day earlier when a man shot another man dead in their presence in Karachi's New Town locality.

Sohail Mughal, who had filed a petition in court for the recovery of his estranged wife and three daughters, had on Sunday allegedly gunned down 37-year-old Munawar Ali, with whom his wife and the children were living in flat in New Town. He had opened the fire in the presence of police personnel, who had escorted him to the victim's residence.

But police authorities said there was no legal cover to book the law enforcement personnel under criminal negligence charges as the new police act put in place a few years ago did not carry any such provision.

âWe donât have any penal section in PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) or Sindh Police Act wherein we could charge police officers for acts of criminal negligence,â revealed DIG East Amir Farooqi.

The senior officer pointed out that previously âwe had section 155 in Police Order 2002 to place criminal liability in instances of criminal negligence by police officersâ, but it was no longer applicable.

All detained police officers of Darakshan police who escorted the suspect on Sunday were thus released.

However, the DIG Farooqi said they have written to the DIG South to ""initiate departmental action against the delinquent police officers who brought accused Sohail Mughal in a police mobile bearing a gun"".

On Sunday, a police party had gone to the residence of Munawar Ali along with petitioner Sohail Mughal to arrest Ali on a court order to present Mughal's wife and his three daughters in court on the next hearing of the case.

However, before the police could arrest him, Mughal, who had hidden a 9mm pistol concealed in his shalwar, took out the gun and opened fire on Ali.

He fired four shots as a result of which Ali sustained two bullet wounds and was taken by the additional SHO Darakhshan to the Liaquat National Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Police arrested Mughal with the pistol and collected spent bullet casings from the crime scene.

On Monday, a case was registered against the suspect under Section 302 (murder) of the PPC on behalf of SHO New Town Mohammed Zubair.

The DIG East explained that the case was registered on behalf of the state as the victimâs family was insisting to nominate the police party which brought Mughal to the victim's residence.

An initial inquiry revealed that the officers could be guilty of ânegligenceâ but they had no involvement in Ali's murder.

The suspect in his initial statement before the police stated that he killed Ali as the deceased had allegedly ""misguided"" his family against him and also ""occupied"" his property.

According to DIG Farooqi, a daughter of the suspect is a doctor and the family had been separated ""legally"" from the father three years ago.

",1/14/2019,"The Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination on Monday announced that Poliovirus was detected from the sewage of eight cities across the country during the environmental surveillance carried out by the polio eradication programme during last month.

According to the results shared by National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), the presence of poliovirus was confirmed in sewage samples collected from Karachi, Peshawar, Bannu, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Killa Abdullah, Pishin and Quetta during December 2018.

Under the supervision of the relevant provincial health departments, samples of sewage water are collected on a monthly basis from 58 sampling sites across Pakistan. They are tested by the regional reference laboratory for polio housed at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad.

As per the statement issued by the health ministry, in consideration of the associated risks, the country's polio programme has urged parents to ensure the immunisation of all children under the age of five in the upcoming polio campaign, which is scheduled to start from January 21.

National Coordinator Emergency Operation Centre for Polio Dr Rana Safdar said that while case counts were declining, as long as the virus was present anywhere in the country, the threat of the virus for vulnerable children remained.

""To finally eradicate the virus, vaccinating all children against all preventable diseases including polio is imperative both in routine as well as in special door to door campaigns,"" Dr Safdar added.

While acknowledging the progress that had already been made, the recently concluded Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio urged the programme to focus on children who missed the vaccination, for any reason and to ensure that the virus didn't survive any longer.

The group met on January 11-12 in Islamabad to assess the programme progress, opportunities and the remaining challenges towards achieving the goal of stopping transmission of the poliovirus.

Prime Minister's Focal Person for Polio Eradication Babar bin Atta said the ""misconception of a caregiver led to paralysis of another child in Bajaur agency, who had every right to live healthy and productive life. It is a reminder to everyone that no excuse can save your child from paralysis, especially if the child is not repeatedly vaccinated.""

105,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457510/nab-chairman-should-appear-before-parliament-demands-zardari,"NAB chairman should appear before parliament, demands Zardari
",1/14/2019,"PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari on Monday said that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman should appear before the parliament in person, instead of lawmakers going to him to discuss the bureau's procedure for moving against opposition members accused of corruption.

Speaking during a National Assembly session, the former president said the time has come for the parliament to call the NAB chairman and ""proclaim a law"" that before any parliamentarian is summoned by NAB, their case should come to the house committee on law so it can decide whether there is actually a case against the said lawmaker or their family.

Editorial: Meaningful accountability

Zardari said he was hearing of plans among various parties to call on the NAB chairman, purportedly to discuss the bureau's anti-corruption drive that has ensnared several opposition members.

""Why will you go to the NAB chairman?"" he asked the MNAs present, before declaring: ""The NAB chairman should appear in person before the parliament.""

Zardari said the matter was not personal to him because he had encountered ""many NABs"" during his career and ""will continue to face them"".

""The real issue is, what will happen when you are summoned [by the accountability watchdog]?"" he said with a meaningful smile, addressing the treasury benches.

Zardari said his party was ""totally happy"" that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had today been given relief by the Supreme Court in the Avenfield corruption reference. He added that the PPP also ""does not want to see"" Nawaz's daughter, Maryam Nawaz, in the jail.

Speaking about his own troubles, he said it would be ""uncalled for"" and ""above the law"" if a new joint investigation team is formed comprising representatives of the ISI and other institutions, in the fake accounts case.

The PPP co-chairman said it was in the government's interest to ""tighten"" the NAB as doing so will reduce the prevailing ""insecurity"" among the bureaucracy and the country will start functioning to some extent.

Criticising the PTI government's performance of the first few months, he told the treasury members: ""We will not bring down your [government], you will fall yourselves.""

He said he wants to work to strengthen the parliament and democracy, and pointing towards government benches said, ""I also want to train these news friends that have come to the parliament.""

'No foreign force can prevent economic slide'

Zardari said the international financial support being given to Pakistan by friendly countries is welcome, but no ""foreign force"" can prevent the economic slide the country appeared to be heading towards because of PTI government's policies.

""Considering the financial situation at present [and] the way decisions are being taken arbitrarily... the country cannot be managed in this manner,"" the former president said.

He said no foreign power, be it China or any other country, could save Pakistan once it starts its journey towards becoming a ""failed state"" on the sliding scale ""because everyone will think of their own country"".

Zardari said during the PPP government's tenure, he had generated interest for investment in Pakistan through his 15 visits to China. It later materalised in the form of the agreement leading to the handover of the Gwadar port to China, he added.

Shahbaz questions Mohmand dam contract award

Earlier, Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif expressed concern over the government's move to award the contract for the Rs309 billion Mohmand dam to a Descon-led consortium on a single bid basis.

He said the manner in which the contract had been awarded had ""put question marks"" on the entire procedure. The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (Pepra) rules allow the award of contracts on a single-bid basis, but with certain conditionalities, he added.

""What was the urgency in awarding the contract?"" the PML-N president questioned. ""Why was rebidding not done?""

He said the bidding process for the project was initiated during the PML-N government, but it was the incumbent government that had awarded the contract. ""The responsibility of awarding the contract for the project lies with the PTI government,"" he added.

He said there was a ""direct conflict of interest"" in awarding the dam contract to the company allegedly owned by Abdul Razak Dawood, who is an adviser to the prime minister.

Shahbaz claimed that the PML-N government had eliminated loadshedding from the country by launching a number of projects on a war-footing basis

""If the country is facing loadshedding again then it is due to the negligence and incapability of the present PTI government.""

He said the current government was generating electricity through furnace oil which is the most expensive fuel and LNG-based power plants were presently not functioning to full capacity.

Opposition hatching conspiracy against dams: Vawda

As Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda stood up to respond to Shahbaz's criticism, the opposition refused to listen to him and staged a walkout.

Meanwhile, Speaker Asad Qaiser ordered a headcount after PPP lawmaker Shagufta Jumani pointed out the quorum. The opposition bid to disrupt proceedings by pointing out the quorum failed, however, with the speaker declaring the house in order after the headcount.

Vawda in his remarks criticised the opposition for staging a walkout after delivering speeches and presenting ""wrong facts before the house"".

Defending the government's award of the Mohmand dam contract to the Descon-led consortium, he said the project had been in files for 54 years and the PTI government had pulled it from there.

""The opposition is hatching a conspiracy against dams as they want to do politics on this issue,"" he alleged.

Vawda said the Mohmand dam will be completed under Imran Khan's government.

He said it was wrong to say that the contract had been awarded on a single-bid basis as five companies had submitted bids for the project after issuance of advertisements.

""The opposition leader has wrongly interpreted the Pepra rules,"" he claimed.

The minister said the government will not offer any NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance-like deal) to the opposition leaders.

""Their politics have been buried [...] they will either go to jail or in exile.""

",1/14/2019,"PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif on Monday spoke in military courts' favour and hinted that his party could consider supporting an extension, if approached by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led government.

Earlier this month, the law ministry informed a National Assembly standing committee that the summary for a second extension in military courts has been forwarded to the federal cabinet for approval.

In December, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had unequivocally said that his party would not support another extension to the military courts, whose current two-year term is set to expire in March.

While the PPP chairman, who had his reservations the last time as well, is unlikely to support the extension, his PML-N counterpart does not appear to oppose the idea.

""If the current government contacts us over the extension of military courts, we will think about it,"" Sharif told media representatives at Parliament House today.

The PML-N leader recalled that the military courts were formed during his sibling Nawaz Sharif's premiership, adding that ""terrorism was eradicated due to the establishment of the military courts, Zarb-i-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad"".

The leader of the opposition in the National Assembly credited the fear created from the military courts as a major factor in the war against terrorism.

Sharif's remarks are in line with those of his fellow PML-N leader Miftah Ismael, who recently said that his party will support the government in extension of tenure of military courts only if the PTI satisfies them in parliament on the issue.

âThe military courts issue will be discussed in parliament. And if the government satisfied the PML-N lawmakers on the reasons behind extending term of the special courts, they will support the cause,â the former adviser on finance told the media on Sunday.

In March 2017, military courts were revived for the next two years after then president Mamnoon Hussain had ratified a NA bill on the matter.

The extension, however, had come after more than two months of deliberations and a tug of war between government and opposition parties over the technicalities of military courts' functioning.

Not only that, Chaudhry had also recently joined the Punjab Cultural Advisory Council to make a real difference but it seems like it didn't work out the way he had hoped; the JPNA actor took to Twitter to share his frustrations and announce that he has stepped down from the council.

While he revealed that some of his suggestions made headway, such as providing medical services to veteran artists, the rest, such as organising a Lahore Film Festival and setting up a film authority offering benefits to help the industry were pretty much ignored and not being implemented:

He elaborates that the reason he felt the need to open up about these issues is because he feels a ""moral obligation even if it's in the capacity of an advisor"" as he believes that he is accountable for the taxpayer's money that has been utilised for these meetings and sessions.

",1/14/2019,"The Supreme Court on Monday expressed disappointment with the central and provincial governments over their failure to devise a mechanism for the conservation and purification of underground water and impose tax on its extraction, in line with a previous decision of the apex court.

A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nasir, was hearing a case pertaining to conservation, purification and taxation on extraction of underground water by bottled water companies.

Last week, the apex court had imposed a levy on companies selling mineral water and beverages at a rate of Re1 for every litre of surface water extracted by them. The revenue so collected will go to the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams fund. Authored by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, the judgement also required the provincial governments as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory administration to set up separate and distinct accounts to receive the amounts collected under the water charges. The amounts will then be deposited in the SC-created dams fund.

The judgement was issued on a suo motu case pertaining to selling by the companies of water extracted from underground sources without any charge as well as the quality and fitness of the same for human consumption.

The apex court had also constituted a special committee to devise a mechanism for calculation, collection and monitoring of the recovery of water charges from all major industries consuming surface or groundwater. The court had directed the federal and provincial governments to ensure installation of a foolproof and state-of-the-art metering mechanism at every extraction unit. The extraction will be monitored closely by the respective EPA on a daily basis, the verdict said.

On Monday, the chief justice remarked that water has become more ""precious than gold [but] if we passed remarks [over the situation] then headlines would state that [the judiciary] has raised questions on the credibility of the government"".

Dr Abdul Rahim, the secretary of the Law and Justice Commission â established for the systematic development and reform of laws â informed the top judge that neither its recommendations on the issue were heeded upon, nor an awareness campaign was launched.

The representative of the Punjab government, Owais Ahmed, informed the bench that the provincial government had approved 31 recommendations out of 38. He said that the government has formed a task force on water reservoirs, purification and taxation to deal with the issue.

Chief Justice Nisar reprimanded the representative, saying that the Supreme Court-mandated Water Commission did a lot of work, ""the government[s] are provided with everything but they don't want to do anything.""

""The Punjab government lacks both the will and the capability,"" the chief justice remarked.

""It seems that you people have decided to kill people of thirst [while] bureaucratic tapes appear in each and every matter. It seems that all the papers will be left in the record room of the court.""

""[We have] said time and again to take measures on a war-footing basis [to resolve the issue],"" he added.

The law and justice commission secretary pleaded the court to issue an order in this regard, to which Justice Nisar replied: ""The court will continue to issue orders but the government has become insensitive. People's lives are associated with water. If the government does nothing, it will be criminal negligence.""

Justice Ijazul Ahsan remarked that the price of water being used by sectors other than bottled water should also be fixed.

The bench observed that the Punjab government had devised a good plan as per the apex court's directions but only on paper. ""No political will is seen,"" Justice Ahsan remarked.

The apex court declared that the reply submitted by the Punjab government was an attempt to eyewash the judiciary and ordered the federal and provincial governments to submit a fresh response within 15 days.

Meanwhile, the commission's secretary said that the ICT administration also lacks a mechanism. He informed the court that the Capital Development Authority (CDA) charges a Rs100 water fee from each and every household, no matter how big or small it is.

The top judge expressed his displeasure over the situation and reprimanded the authority.

During an earlier hearing, the apex court had noted that the government of Sindh had set prices for the use of groundwater.

",1/14/2019,"IN December 2018, the Supreme Court of Pakistan passed an order that forced high-cost private schools to reduce any fees in excess of Rs5,000 by 20 per cent. The order itself was the outcome of a long and protracted battle, taken up by the court, on the insistence of protesting parents who stated that high-cost private schools were charging âextortionaryâ fees, and subjecting them to arbitrary increases.

Last week, the court â specifically the outgoing chief justice â expressed his displeasure on hearing that high-cost private schools had started to cut back on extra- and co-curricular activities in the wake of its order. The courtâs reaction appeared strange given that this was something everyone had predicted even before the price reduction was announced.

The issue of regulating fees in high-cost private schools is not a new one, and has produced considerable debate ever since the latest round of protests broke out around three years ago. Prior to the courtâs intervention, it was also not an issue on which one could take a straightforward moral or policy decision. At its simplest, if high-cost private schools were subjecting their customers to exorbitant fee increases, (especially in tandem with one another as some have alleged), then as is the case with any private-sector enterprise some element of consumer protection and regulation is required.

What complicates it a bit (at least for some) is the moral dimension. Should education be treated like a car or a bar of soap? Does a normative component make schooling, especially in its societal function, appear as something distinctly sacred, and the act of wanton profiteering off it as somehow distinctly profane? To many, including myself, the idea of âsellingâ education for profit appears abhorrent.

Should education be treated like a car or a bar of soap? To many, the idea of âsellingâ education for profit appears abhorrent.

Education allows individuals to expand their capabilities and opportunities. Any version of a socially just society would not discriminate the attainment of these functions on the ability to pay.

At the same time though, one can recognise that the final responsibility for this distasteful situation lies largely with the state, which has both allowed for-profit activity in this sector, and encourages it to flourish by failing to carry out its own social welfare functions.

However, one must thank the court for inadvertently producing clarity on what has shown itself to be a difficult moral and policy conundrum otherwise. Whether one is theoretically in favour of regulating high-cost private schools or not, it is possible to agree that the way the court has done it may not be correct.

For starters, there is no actual principal at work here. The 20pc reduction does not fall in line with any broader framework of market regulation. In the absence of a detailed reasoning connected to financial forensics, we are left wondering about the basis of this particular number. Similarly, the Rs5,000 minimum at which it kicks in is also entirely arbitrary. Why are parents who send their kids to schools charging Rs4,999 being deprived of the courtâs generosity?

Secondly, one does not need to be an economist to realise that price caps produce distortionary effects, and profit is usually the last thing compromised in such instances. Adding to the mess is the fact that school owners know that schooling as a product is relatively inelastic â itâs not easy to swap schools in the middle of a school year â so they can get away with reducing the quality of service provision. It may be the case that this is exactly what the intended message of an over-the-top-quality reduction is â a ploy to get the court to realise they do not agree with its decision. There are already reports circulating of class sizes being increased, teachers being laid off, and salaries being delayed. In the short to medium run those attending these schools will bear the cost of what was ironically intended to provide them with immediate relief.

Finally, as succinctly analysed by education researcher and academic, Minahil Asim, the courtâs order carries no substantive redistributive function. Underpinning this point is the fact that the entire issue concerns a minuscule section of the population. As detailed in the short order, the brunt of the courtâs attack is on large, high-cost private school chains like Lahore Grammar, City School, and Beaconhouse. Collectively, such schools cater to no more than a couple of per cent of the total school-going population.

The only reason why this is even an issue is because this couple of per cent lies at or near the top of the income distribution, and carries social and political heft, which is why its protests are heard by those in power. At the end of the day, the entire issue results in a short-term monetary transfer from privileged school owners to slightly less privileged upper-middle-class parents. And even that is offset by the reduction in quality schools are currently undertaking.

Without offering any sympathy for elite private school owners, and I certainly have none, one can see that as a policy instrument, arbitrary capping of profit for a small number of businesses is a strange moral crusade, especially when this has no positive spill-over for the rest of the population.

This is not to say there are no smart ways of regulating elite private schools â India and a host of other countries have instituted actual redistributive quotas for the underprivileged in such schools in order to expand quality educational opportunities. Similarly, from a consumer protection point of view, if there is collusion and cartelisation between elite school chains, the Competition Commission must be empowered to investigate and then, if needed, levy a punishment. The larger point here is that the issue needs to be approached holistically, with education, redistribution, and consumer protection forming key pillars of regulation. What is quite clear so far is that the current attempt has none of these as its basis.

",1/14/2019,"THE policy of keeping the rupee-dollar exchange rate fixed over extended periods of time, despite manifest signs of currency overvaluation, has not served Pakistan well. The parity was held around 60 during the Musharraf era, and around 100 in the recent Dar era. In both cases, unsustainable external deficits emerged, culminating in balance-of-payments crises requiring large shock devaluations and foreign bailouts to fix.

These intermittent currency crises are a major impediment to Pakistanâs long-term prosperity. They incentivise businesses to focus on short-term returns rather than long-term investments to boost the countryâs economic potential. They deter foreign direct investors demanding macroeconomic stability and policy continuity as prerequisites. And, they weaken Pakistanâs geopolitical standing and sovereignty (bailouts are never a free lunch).

Yet, despite these nontrivial costs, we hardly see any âreal-timeâ opposition to this fixed rupee-dollar policy while it is in full implementation. One cannot recall any commentators (other than IFIs) clamouring for timely adjustment of the rupee during the Musharraf and Dar eras. And if this government decided to stabilise the exchange rate at 150 for the next three years, one expects few to object. Why? Because, unfortunately, the political economy is supportive of such a policy.

Pakistanâs opinion-makers are major beneficiaries of an artificially low rupee-dollar rate.

Pakistanâs opinion-makers are major beneficiaries of an artificially low rupee-dollar rate: it subsidises their spending on luxury imports (such as SUVs), childrenâs education abroad, and vacation travel. The masses donât protest, as the more affordable import prices and lower inflation associated with an overvalued currency imply a quality of life improvement of sorts, albeit short-lived. Financing of the resulting higher imports/external deficits is also easier under a fixed parity as global banks generally lend in dollars.

One can ask why exporters do not protest the overvaluation policy. They probably do, but after years of import bias, the export lobby has weakened, and is overtaken in foreign exchange terms by overseas Pakistanis, whose remittances are largely insensitive to exchange rate movements.

The only way to break this unholy bias in favour of a low/fixed rupee-dollar parity is by raising awareness about its economic flaws and costs; and articulating an alternative currency regime to serve a volatile emerging market well. To this end, letâs examine why a fixed rupee-dollar parity makes little economic sense for Pakistan.

The correct measure of a countryâs external competitiveness is its real, not nominal, exchange rate; the more appreciated the real exchange rate, the lower the countryâs competitiveness, ceteris paribus. A percentage change in Pakistanâs real exchange rate equals the sum of: (i) the percentage change in the nominal exchange rate (where a more depreciated nominal exchange rate raises competitiveness); and (ii) the inflation rate differential between Pakistan and its trading partners (where a positive differential reduces competitiveness).

Assuming the US was Pakistanâs only trading partner, a stable rupee-dollar parity would guard against a loss in Pakistanâs competitiveness only if the inflation rates for Pakistan and the US are aligned. This is far from true: between mid-2013 (when the last IMF programme began) and end-2017, cumulative inflation amounted to 21 per cent in Pakistan vs 6pc in the US, implying a rupee overvaluation of 15pc vs the dollar alone.

But Pakistan did trade not only with the US; 92pc of our recent trade was with other economies, led by China (20pc), the Euro Area (12pc), UAE (11pc). Unfortunately, inflation (21pc) was also higher than these other trading partnersâ inflation (8pc), exacerbating the rupeeâs overvaluation. Moreover, the currencies of these other trading partners depreciated on average by 9pc against a rising dollar, so with the rupee tied to the dollar, there was also a nominal rupee appreciation vis-Ã -vis these economies. The combined effect was a 22pc real effective (ie trade weighted) appreciation of the rupee between mid-2013 and end-2017. (A table and a chart, on Pakistanâs trade share with its major trading partners, and real effective exchange rate path, are included in Dawnâs web version of this article.)

The foregoing provides a measure of the massive external imbalance that had accumulated under the last government, and which had to be fixed. The rupeeâs nominal depreciation in 2018 of 33pc should deliver a good part of the needed real depreciation, though probably not all of it. Pakistanâs non-US trading partnersâ and other competitorsâ currencies have also depreciated against the US dollar in 2018 (by 5pc and 18pc respectively, in median terms). Thus, the net improvement in Pakistanâs competitiveness due to the 2018 nominal devaluation of 33pc is likely to have been less than the around 22pc required to remove the overvaluation. (A table on the nominal currency depreciation of several of Pakistanâs competitors has been included in the web version of this article.)

If a stable rupee-dollar framework is not appropriate for Pakistan, what is? We can get a clue from Pakistanâs competitors. Most allowed their exchange rates vis-Ã -vis the US dollar to adjust early in the 2013-17 period (median depreciation was 13pc). This timely adjustment helped them avoid the cliff drop of 33pc the rupee suffered in 2018.

Thereâs no reason why a similar, more flexible exchange rate regime, anchored in a basket of trading partner currencies (rather than a single currency), should not work well. However, a more flexible regime will bring its own imperatives. With a more volatile currency, the private sector will need access to better instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk. The government would be well advised to develop futures and forward options that financial institutions and traders can access at reasonable cost.

Finally, a credibly independent State Bank, and clear communication are needed to regain the severely dented market confidence. If markets do not believe in the announced exchange rate policy, it is not worth the paper it is written on. Markets can bet (and win) against a currency even when the latter is in line with fundamentals. And the experience of the UKâs Black Wednesday (Sept 16, 1992) has shown that no sovereign, however powerful, can survive the marketâs onslaught.

",1/14/2019,"The Supreme Court on Monday upheld an Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict that had ordered the suspension of prison sentences awarded to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in the Avenfield corruption reference.

A five-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, dismissed National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) plea against the high court's decision.

The apex court, in its ruling, said that NAB has failed to provide the ""ground for cancellation of bail"" and that the IHC had not exceeded its authority in granting bail to the convicts of the Avenfield reference.

Read: Avenfield House or âtax havenâ house?

The Supreme Court's decision brings a rare relief for the Sharif family, both of whose leaders â Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif â are currently incarcerated.

Maryam thanked ""Allah Almighty for today's decision"" but said that her ""true relief and happiness would be when my father comes back home.""

At the outset of the hearing today, the chief justice told NAB prosecutor Akram Qureshi to ""convince [the bench] why the high court's ruling should be suspended"".

The chief justice told the NAB counsel to delineate the grounds on which the apex court can suspend the granting of bail. ""Also tell us if the high court had the authority to suspend the sentence,"" he added.

Qureshi explained that his argument stood on the basis of earlier cases heard by the top court, claiming that bail can only be granted in the case of ""hardship"", which was not the reason behind IHC's verdict.

The NAB prosecutor pointed out that the IHC had questioned the merit of the trial in its judgement â something he said a high court cannot do in a bail plea.

Take a look: IHC surprised at âlapseâ by NAB in Avenfield case

""Nawaz Sharif was granted bail on the same grounds that had led to his conviction,"" observed Justice Gulzar Ahmed, who was also part of the bench. ""You did not challenge those grounds.""

Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, who is set to succeed Justice Nisar as the top judge, said that NAB's argument was not ""solid"" and rejected the claim that the high court had exceeded its authority.

He further said that the high court had mentioned that its ""observation was not final"".

The chief justice, however, told the NAB prosecutor that ""an interim order is never final and [it] never affects the final verdict either.""

In July 2018, an accountability court had handed Sharif 10 years as jail time for owning assets beyond known income and 1 year for not cooperating with NAB.

His daughter Maryam was given seven years for abetment after she was found ""instrumental in concealment of the properties of her father"" and one year for non-cooperation with the bureau. Meanwhile, Nawaz's son-in-law retired Captain Safdar has been given one year jail time â for not cooperating with NAB, and aiding and abeting Nawaz and Maryam.

113,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457471/mentally-ill-ex-cop-khizar-hayats-case-forwarded-to-larger-bench-for-hearing,"Mentally ill ex-cop Khizar Hayat's case forwarded to larger bench for hearing
",1/14/2019,"A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court Lahore registry on Monday while hearing an appeal for the suspension of the death sentence of mentally-ill prisoner Khizar Hayat forwarded the matter to a larger bench for hearing and adjourned the case for an indefinite period.

Hayat, a former police constable, was convicted in October 2001 for killing a fellow policeman. He was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003. He has spent nearly 15 years on death row. Hayat was first diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic in 2008 by jail medical authorities.

In 2010, the jail medical officer recommended that Hayat needed specialised treatment and should be shifted to the psychiatric facility. However, this was never done. In 2017, the Lahore High Court (LHC) had stayed the execution of Hayat, but rejected his mother's appeal for a stay in December 2018.

Last week, a district and sessions court in Lahore fixed Hayat's execution for Jan 15.

On Saturday, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had taken notice of the issuing of a death warrant for Hayat and sought a report to ascertain his ailment, suspending his sentence until further orders. He had also directed the law officer to verify whether the condemned prisoner was mentally ill.

A two-member bench comprising Justices Manzoor Ahmad Malik and Sardar Tariq Masood heard the appeal for suspension of Hayat's death sentence filed by his mother Iqbal Bano. Jail officials and a mental health specialist were in court today, along with Hayat's lawyer.

The lawyer contended before the bench that the Supreme Court had halted executions in similar cases in the past.

""But why wasn't the state of his mental health raised earlier during the trial?"" Justice Manzoor Ahmad Malik asked. ""Why, when he is set to be punished, is the point being raised?""

The lawyer responded that Hayat had been diagnosed with schizophrenia during the trial, adding that a six-member medical board had been set up in 2016 to examine his mental health and confirmed that he had a mental illness.

According to Section 444 of the jail rules, a person with a mental illness cannot be executed, the lawyer argued.

""Do you believe that Hayat's mental state is not right?"" Justice Malik asked the doctor in court.

""Khizar Hayat is suffering from a mental illness,"" replied Dr Mubashir, adding that a medical board could be set up to examine his mental state.

""In this state, the subject does not know what he is doing,"" the doctor added.

The jail official apprised the court that Hayat was being held at the hospital at Kot Lakhpat jail.

Justice Malik noted that Hayat's medical report is not completely clear. He appeared wary that other convicts would start appealing against their convictions using mental illness as a pretext.

""We're sending the matter to a larger bench,"" he added.

The court subsequently ordered that the appeal against Hayat's execution be forwarded to a larger bench, and adjourned the case indefinitely.

Mother challenges death sentence

Khizar Hayat's mother, Iqbal Bano, in her appealing challenging her son's death sentence, had requested the chief justice to visit the Kot Lakhpat jail ward for mentally ill prisoners and investigate what medicines were being given to her son.

She pleaded that his medical records be investigated ""to determine why his treatment was not being done properly and why his condition was worsening day by day"".

The appeal also challenged the LHC division bench's 2018 judgement, and sought a stay on Hayat's execution. It said the judgement passed by the division bench was not in accordance with law and the prison rules. It said the bench mixed the conviction with execution and thereby dismissed the petition on wrong premises.

It stated that the bench had not appreciated the extensive medical history of the appellantâs son as well as the reports of the medical boards establishing the mental ailment of Hayat.

The appeal argued that a condemned prisoner could not be executed in utter disregard of the prison rules on the subject. It pleaded that the government had a legal duty under the Prisons Rules 1978 to provide the appellantâs son with adequate and appropriate treatment for his mental illness at a psychiatric facility.

",1/14/2019,"A JIT CULTURE that appears to have developed in the country â institutions and political parties seeking ad hoc, intelligence agencies-driven Joint Investigation Teams to probe all manner of public malfeasance and corruption â has been carried to a mirthful new level.

Criticising the electricity and gas shortages in the country, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Saturday demanded the formation of a JIT to probe who is responsible for the ongoing energy crisis. Perhaps Mr Abbasi was speaking in a lighter vein, but other political leaders do not appear to share Mr Abbasiâs humour.

Also read: JIT deletion

Revelations last week that a sister of Prime Minister Imran Khan has more previously undisclosed properties abroad resulted in some opposition leaders immediately demanding that a JIT be formed and Mr Khanâs sister be placed on the ECL. It appears that the leading opposition parties, the PML-N and the PPP, believe that since their leaders have been subjected to unfair JIT processes, the PTI must suffer similarly.

The opposition is wrong. The emergence of JITs is a trend that ought to discouraged, not encouraged. While in certain cases a JIT may be merited, its extensive and unrestrained use undermines normal institutional processes.

Moreover, the intelligence component which gives JITs a perceived weight in certain quarters acts to further muddy institutional waters, renders murky the separation of powers and adds to a perception of civil-military tensions in the country. As the Supreme Court itself has reiterated in recent days in the wake of the controversy over the JIT report on the so-called fake banks account case, a JIT report is not a conclusive finding of fact.

At most, a JIT report can be a starting point for the investigation and prosecution aides of the legal process. And it is in those areas â investigation and prosecution â that the state should concentrate its reform efforts. An effective accountability process is one whose foundations are strong institutions as opposed to ad hoc attempted solutions.

At a time when parliament may take up the issue of again extending the life of military courts for civilians accused of terrorism by the state, would it not further the democratic project by debating and implementing meaningful investigation, prosecution and judicial reforms?

At the moment, the politicisation of JITs virtually ensures that their findings and recommendations are immediately denounced as partisan. The politicisation also helps the political class avoid providing adequate explanations in the court of public opinion â politicians have spent more time attacking the formation and composition of JITs than answering the allegations set out in JIT reports.

If accountability is to be fair, transparent and across the board the process of accountability must be through a stronger institutional framework. Surely if the PTI, PML-N or PPP proposes a strong but transparent accountability process, the other parties will need to seriously consider them.

Instead of demanding JITs for all manner of issues, the political class should debate institutional reforms.

",1/14/2019,"Freelance reporter Asad Hashim was named as winner of the 2018 Agence France-Presse Kate Webb Prize on Monday for his coverage of the plight of ethnic Pashtuns and blasphemy issues in his native Pakistan.

The award, named after one of AFP's finest correspondents, recognises journalism by locally-hired reporters in Asia operating in risky or difficult conditions.

Hashim, 33, was honoured for a series of articles on ethnic Pashtuns and other minority groups caught in the crossfire of Pakistan's fight against militants.

Take a look: The cold emptiness of South Waziristan

These included an investigative report into enforced disappearances allegedly conducted by the country's powerful military and a reporting mission to the South Waziristan tribal region â birthplace of Pakistan's Taliban â to look into the civilian toll from landmines.

Pakistan has battled homegrown militancy for nearly 15 years, with tens of thousands of people killed, and insurgents retain the ability to carry out devastating attacks despite recent improvements in security.

âThese are challenging times for journalists in Pakistan, and Asad Hashim's work stands out for the kind of courageous, independent reporting the Kate Webb Prize was created to recognise,â said AFP Asia-Pacific regional director Philippe Massonnet.

âHis deeply-researched articles tackle sensitive subjects with an admirable balance of passion, commitment and journalistic detachment.â

The award also recognised his work on other highly sensitive issues, such as Pakistan's blasphemy laws and the country's judicial system.

âI am honoured by the jury's decision to select my work this year,â Hashim said after learning he was the winner of the 2018 prize.

âI consider the award not just a recognition of my work, but of all Pakistani journalists, who have been working in an increasingly restrictive reporting environment over the last year.â

At the outset of the case today, the FBR representative told the court that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had provided data of 895 people and 1,365 properties. About 360 people took advantage of tax amnesty scheme to protect 484 properties, he added.

The FBR audit member further said that Rs340 million have so far been recovered, while the recovery of another Rs768m is expected.

The progress of the case did not impress the chief justice. ""You have all the data; you should have taken action within hours,"" he said, adding that the matter would never have been taken up if the court had not taken notice.

The FBR member apprised the court that 157 people have still not come forward and that the FBR has written to the Dubai authority for their data.

Meanwhile, a report submitted in the court by the FIA claimed that 1,211 Pakistani citizens own 2,154 properties in the UAE. A further 345 people have been served notices, the report said.

The report also said that 61 people remain unidentified, five are deceased, 10 are uncooperative while one is absconding.

Furthermore, the FIA report said that 413 people took advantage of the tax amnesty scheme that ended in August last year, whereas 167 people declared their properties to the FBR inquiry officer.

It stated that 79 people declared their properties in tax returns filed for the FBR, while 97 people disowned their properties in the UAE. Previously, the FIA had identified 1,115 people who owned properties in the UAE.

Prime Minister Imran Khan's sister Aleema Khanum, who is named as one of the benamidars of a property in the United Arab Emirates, was also present in the court for today's hearing. The court had ordered Khanum to appear in person today.

Talking to the media after the hearing, Khanum regretted that people were poking fun at ""the machines that employ hundreds and thousands of people"".

""You can check [my] wealth statement, I have earned for myself after working for 20 years,"" she claimed.

In the deadliest terror attack in the countryâs history, 131 schoolchildren and 10 other people were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the APS on Dec 16, 2014.

Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had taken a suo motu notice of the APS case in April when parents of some martyred students, including mothers, approached him while he was hearing other cases in Peshawar.

The parents had complained that a few weeks before the attack, the authorities had been alerted by the National Counter Terrorism Authority to the possibility of an attack on an army-run institution, but no measures had been taken to prevent the attack.

The parents pointed out that they had been demanding justice for the last three years and had been calling for the appointment of a judicial commission to look into the incident, but to no avail.

âWe cannot bring back the near and dear ones who lost their lives but at least we can lessen the agony and grief of the victim families to some extent,â Chief Justice Nisar had remarked during a hearing in October, ordering the formation of a commission with instructions to file a report after a thorough inquiry lasting six weeks.

At the outset of the hearing today, the chief justice recalled that the court had formed a commission, and enquired if it has submitted its report.

Advocate general Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told Justice Nisar that 147 testimonies have been recorded but another 109 are still pending.

""Until these testimonies are not complete, we cannot furnish the report,"" said the provincial advocate general.

",1/14/2019,"AS the current chief justiceâs tenure comes to a close, the news of extrajudicial actions taken in that time has far exceeded the news of the many regular judicial decisions taken therein. This last occurred during the tenure of Iftikhar Chaudhry as chief justice.

Many articles have been written by lawyers arguing the merits and demerits of the actions of both chiefs. Proponents of this method of âjudicial governanceâ argue that overreach is necessary where the executive is so deeply flawed.

Critics argue that there is no difference between overreach by the judiciary and overreach by similarly unelected forces.

Proponents of the Chaudhry regime who forgave its flaws only because its aims were anti-establishment find themselves in the other camp when faced with the âestablished and unitedâ might of the dam-funding Justice Nisar.

Critics argue this is the natural fallout of accepting the populist suo motu-ism on bottles of wine as propagated by Chaudhry.

Also read: Why 2018 was CJP Nisar's year

However, the most critical similarity is perhaps the evolution of the personal ethos of both men and how it underwent such a tremendous and perhaps mysterious change in an age where the minds of normal, lesser men are set and rigid.

Why would a judge suddenly go against his own ethos?

Some brilliant arguments were made after the reversal of the houbara bustard hunting ban judgement. The about-face came immediately post the short Jawwad Khwaja tenure as chief justice. It was argued that such a frequent change of mind dilutes the power of the judiciary as a whole and exhibits a political change of heart rather than a change of the judicial mind.

Take a look: Chief justice cautions politicians against 'undermining judiciary'

Justice Nisar was one of four judges out of the 17-member bench of the Supreme Court who dissented against any idea of a âbasic structureâ or salient features in our Constitution. In what orthodox legal minds would consider his finest hour, a full-throated critique from Justice Nisar of such a restriction, upon what he viewed to be the absolute right of the people, included the following: âIf we were to introduce such a doctrine into Pakistan would not critics be entitled to speculate whether the nation has changed a military autocracy for a judicial autocracy, with but a brief interval for an improperly functioning democracy.â

When critiquing the power the Indian supreme court now enjoyed over parliament, Justice Nisar wrote: âThis is of course a completely unprecedented display of âjudicialâ power â power in its most naked form. Not merely unchecked, but uncheckable, since there are no means of checking it known to the laws of any civilised system of jurisprudence. This is a malady for which there is no remedy and an ailment for which there is no cure short of a complete uprooting of the judicial and democratic system. A power so vast, so all embracing, can hardly be conceived by any democratic system of governance resting on the basic principle of checks and balances.â

What then is the process by which a senior judge after assuming the ultimate seat of his office begins to rewrite theories he has personally expressed and endorsed throughout his tenure? For Chaudhry, servility had got him as far as the Supreme Court and it was going to take him no further. It was time to bare teeth to who had until then been the master, and an undercurrent of resentment already existed to help those teeth sink in deeper than they otherwise would have. A seven-year tenure as chief ahead of him, extraordinary because of the nature of his own appointment, convinced his activism and steeled it.

But what of Justice Nisar â rose through the merit of his acumen rather than his politics, authored fundamental judgements which limited the authoritarian functioning of federal government through the prime minister and his bureaucracy. He opined strictly against judicial overreach.

What makes such a man suddenly demand money for a personal pride project that he admittedly has no expertise about? What is the difference between endorsing a large dam without adequate research into its viability or feasibility, and endorsing Agha Waqarâs water kit?

Why would a judge who has personally espoused judicial restraint, written it into the body of the most famous judgements he was part of; suddenly go against his own ethos?

What made him suddenly become a jurist who threatened parties with the demolition of their premises or other criminal sanction unless they deposited money into âhisâ dam fund? What made him the weekend warrior who held conferences on population control? What personal need for publicity or expression could suddenly arise in a man whose office was already his, and limited to a term predefined? What made or compelled this brilliant and conservative adjudicator to suddenly become this populist and activist force?

The answer to these questions may be singular; and will most certainly determine his legacy.

121,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457467/what-do-pakistan-and-china-want-from-cpec-going-forward,"What do Pakistan and China want from CPEC going forward?
",1/14/2019,"China and Pakistan have made strides â particularly in electricity and infrastructure projects â in the first three-year phase of their cooperation under the multi-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Both countries have had good and not-so-good experiences and are learning about each otherâs strengths and deficiencies as they try to build upon lessons learnt.

At the conclusion of the recently held eighth meeting of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC), they agreed to conduct at least five in-depth sector studies for future investment cooperation under the framework as Islamabad pursues more financial support and Beijing seeks increased facilitation, improved security and a smooth repayment mechanism. In addition, âboth sides agreed to make joint efforts to improve the overall media environment for CPEC cooperationâ.

Pakistan made a formal request to the JCC â the highest decision-making body on the CPEC â for âmore grant, investment, joint ventures and concessional loan arrangements to strengthen and fast trackâ transport infrastructure, industrial cooperation and socio-economic development.

Beijing is annoyed at the Sindh government for slow progress on Karachi Circular Railway, which it considers critical for the cityâs prosperity

Chinaâs focus during the meeting that ended on Dec 20 was more on putting in place a mechanism that ensures smooth repayments given Pakistanâs financial constraints. It expects Islamabad to further strengthen the security structure and take targeted measures to reduce the threat of terrorism by speeding up the building and deployment of Special Security Division-South. Beijing is also pushing more vigorously for the removal of irritants in the implementation of existing projects.

Led jointly by Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, and Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar, minister for planning, development reforms, meeting participants appreciated that the CPEC had achieved important milestones of early-harvest projects (EHP) and was now entering a new development stage.

The in-depth studies will be on Pakistanâs power market, a cascade study for hydropower projects all along the Jhelum River, optimisation of overall energy mix, an oil and gas industry development plan and a five-year action plan for cooperation on the highway between China and Pakistan as part of the joint traffic density study.

â(The) results of a joint study on power market of Pakistan will be fundamental for deciding the next step of energy cooperation.â The working on the study has just begun. Pakistan has committed to putting into operation all transmission lines required for the evacuation of energy well before CPEC projects achieve commercial operations to avoid penalties.

The payment of outstanding tariffs for the operational energy projects is a source of irritation for China. The two sides agreed to have scientific planning and amicable negotiations to address the issues arising from energy cooperation and create a common panel under the joint working group on energy for monthly formal and informal communications and consultations.

Pakistan promised a timely recovery of bills from consumers as part of the ongoing campaign to reduce line losses and improve collection through reforms and new technology. But Pakistan also wanted Chinese technical support with respect to technology. A comprehensive technical study will also be carried out to increase the production capacity of the surface mine in the Thar coalfield.

Pakistan has demanded that a major 1,320-megawatt Rahimyar Khan project under CPEC be scrapped on the ground that its next-stage priority was using domestic sources of energy. Hence, the need for maximum benefits from the Jhelum River flows by optimising the combined operation of all cascade projects there.

On the industrial side, China asked Pakistan that the Board of Investment should act as lead agency for industrial development and ensure land, energy, taxation, customs, law and other services from the relevant departments to deal with land prices, park development models and infrastructure services.

Rashakai in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dhabeji in Thatta and M3 in Faisalabad have been selected as special industrial zones for the first phase of development. They will promote Chinese investments in key industries, like textile, petro-chemical and iron and steel.

In infrastructure, both sides are happy with the progress on two big projects: $8.2 billion Mainline (ML-1) from Karachi to Khyber and $2bn Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) besides Eastbay Expressway Gwadar and security arrangements for them. Pakistan has promised to ensure timely land acquisition and demolition for the project implementation.

The preliminary design of ML-1 will be ready this month. The project will be implemented in line with the framework agreement signed in May 2017. This means China will provide up to 85 per cent of the project cost as a loan as opposed to a âbuild-operate-transferâ model proposed by the PTI government to shift financial responsibility on to the private sector and keep government loans on the lower side.

Beijing is annoyed about slow progress on KCR by the provincial government despite the project being critical and feasible for the growth and prosperity of the countryâs largest city. Mass transit projects for Quetta and Peshawar have been put on the back burner for the time being because of a lack of preparedness. These will be taken up once their PC-1s are approved by the relevant government forums.

Noting full operational capability of the Gwadar Port, the two sides agreed to continuously pay high attention to it. Weekly container liner services are calling the port as coal trans-shipment and clinker export take place. The JCC appreciated progress on the Gwadar Free Zone. It agreed to jointly make more efforts to attract qualified companies to invest in the area.

Pakistan was required to provide agreed tax and tariff mechanisms to create a good investment environment leading to the next phase. The two sides have failed so far to finalise the Gwadar Smart City Master Plan, but promised to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the New Gwadar International Port before March 2019.

",1/14/2019,"PESHAWAR: The 352nd birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh was celebrated here on Sunday amid tight security and people from various minority groups participated in the event.

The celebrations in connection with the birth anniversary had commenced on Friday and concluded in Gurdwara Bhai Joga Singh at Mohallah Jogan Shah Qissa Khwani, Peshawar, on Sunday.

According to a statement, the three-day event was organised by the Auqaf, Religious and Minority Affairs Department, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to show harmony and celebrate inclusiveness.

Auqaf secretary says budget allocated for religious festivals of minorities

On the first day, a procession was held which was marked by rendering of hymns by Sikh community, including men and women. Over 5,000 Sikh devotees from across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took part in the procession and then other rituals followed by Langar (feast).

Adequate measures were put in place by the police department to ensure full security for smooth celebration of the event.

The chief guests included MPAs Ravi Kumar and Wazirzada and Sikh community leader Ranjeet Singh besides some government officials. The major attraction of the procession was the display of âGatka,â a famous Sikh martial art and other sword exercises.

On this occasion, MPA Ravi Kumar paid tribute to the slain Soran Singh and said that his services as adviser to the chief minister and his personal efforts for the communities would always be remembered.

He also said that such events would build understanding of traditions and beliefs of minorities and people here had shown a sign of interfaith harmony. In response to the demand of Sikh community, he said that Shamshan Ghat would soon be set up.

In this regard, MPA Wazirzada said that celebration of minoritiesâ events would help spread love and peace. He maintained that the minorities were allowed to practice their religion freely.

",1/14/2019,"PESHAWAR: The World Health Organisation, which is providing technical assistance to the authorities to streamline healthcare financing in all provinces and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, will help them to put in place a uniform programme of free healthcare across the country.

A mission of WHO including Prof Soonman, Dr Faraz Khalid and Dr Mohammad Saeed Akbar Khan held discussions with the officials of health and finance departments during a visit to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recently.

The mission, which reached Pakistan on January 8, 2019 on the governmentâs invitation to streamline its healthcare financing system, also visited other provinces and later presented its recommendations to Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (NHSRC) regarding improvement in the system.

The health department officials told Dawn that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had launched Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP) two years ago that benefitted about 150,000 patients. Under it, each household of eight persons is entitled to get services up to Rs540,000 but still there is room for improvement.

The government pays premium to the insurance company, but the latter retains 20 per cent of the unspent amount at the end of the year and returns 80 per cent to the former. The health department wants that entire amount should be spent on patientsâ health and profit margin by the company should be reduced.

As the government has designated about 100 private and state-run hospitals to treat people under the SSP, but bulk of the amount goes to the private sector because of prompt services being provided to the patients there.

In the government hospitals, the doctors and other staff involved in the treatment of SSPâs patients donât get any additional benefits due to which they are least interested in their treatment, according to sources.

âThe WHO has been providing technical assistance to the government to offer quality healthcare services to families living below the poverty line through free of cost health insurance programmes and is devising strategy to bring uniformity among the programmes run by federal government and province, especially SSP in KP,â said officials.

They said that those initiatives were steps towards realisation of the WHOâs Universal Health Coverage, which needed to be ensured in the face of hefty rise in public sector expenditure as well as high cost of medicines. Not only these programmes ensure that the under-privileged citizens across the country get access to quality medical services in a swift and dignified manner, but it also ascertains, by preventing the catastrophic expenditures on health, that poor families do not slip further down the poverty line.

The world health agency has conducted a âhealth financing diagnostic reviewâ of social health protection initiatives to plan for further public sector funding and sustainability of these initiatives, specifically undertaking an in-depth diagnostic analysis of the health financing system in the country by taking into consideration the developed political arrangement and identifying the challenges including raising, managing and using financial health resources.

According to officials, the WHOâs visit was aimed at generating a policy dialogue to promote more public money for health by undertaking a fiscal space analysis for the health sector and identifying alternative relevant resource mobilisation arrangements.

Pakistan has sought WHOâs technical cooperation to develop a federal health financing policy that could be used in the formulation of provincial health financing strategies. The UN health agency will also extend cooperation to the government in designing and implementing the health insurance programme in the provinces to enhance financial protection goal for the poor.

",1/14/2019,"PESHAWAR: The austerity drive of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is likely to sweep away wildlife department as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa environment department has moved a summary to merge it with the forest department.

Minister for Environment Syed Mohammad Ishtiaq said that summary regarding merger of the two departments was forwarded to chief minister and chief secretary on Friday last. The cabinet will approve the summary. He said that merger of Forest Development Corporation with forest department was also on the cards to avoid overlapping and streamline the affairs.

âThe purpose of merger of the two departments is to save resources and share responsibilities among employees to protect forests as well as wildlife,â the minister told Dawn.

Proposal shocks wildlife conservators

The wildlife department was set up in 1995. Before, it was functioning under the umbrella of forest department in the name of âgame wingâ. The government will amend the relevant laws for merger of the two departments.

The environment departmentâs proposal shocked wildlife conservators, who termed the move âvery damagingâ for the management of wildlife in the province.

âThis decision will affect wildlife management,ââ said Dr Mumtaz Malik, former chief conservator and founder of the department. He added that wildlife would go back to zero after merger of the two departments.

âA department, which got national and international recognitions and introduced activities like trophy hunting of wild species, established national parks, wildlife parks and conservancies, is being abolished in the name of merger,â he said.

An expert associated with an international conservation body said that wildlife would lose its identity and specialised staff if an established department was abolished. âThe government should not wind up an established department,â he said, adding that those two disciplines were separated in 1970s.

More than 1,000 employees of the wildlife department would be put at the disposal of forest department. In addition, the post of chief conservator of wildlife department would stand abolished after the merger.

The department is currently managing seven national parks including Lulusar-Dudipatsar, Chitral Gol, Broghil Valley, Ayubia, Saiful Muluk and Sheikh Badin. Setting up of national parks not only improved natural habitats but also moved some rare species like snow leopard and markhor from the endangered to vulnerable categories with the support of local communities.

If cabinet approves the merger, chief conservator forests will look after both flora and fauna in the province including thousands of hectors of national parks, wildlife parks, conservancies, game reserves and wetlands etc. The post of chief conservator of wildlife will also be dissolved, according to the summary.

The previous government of PTI had made a comprehensive law called Wildlife and Biodiversity (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Act, 2015. Forest and wildlife operate under the umbrella of environment department. The previous government had announced three more national parks in the province.

Minister Ishtiaq said that the merger would not only save resources, but would also resolve the issue of duplication. He expected over Rs30 million saving for the government annually after merger of the two departments. âThe problem is that employees of the two departments evade responsibilities and ignore offences in their areas of jurisdiction,â he said.

He said that officials of the wildlife remained indifferent when they came across any forest-related offences during duty and same was the case with forest staff in connection with wildlife offences.

But officials disagreed with the ministerâs remarks and alleged that some vested interests in the forest department were trying to increase âgrazing areaâ for themselves in the name of merger. They said that forest and wildlife were two different subjects, which required specialised expertise and qualifications and experts in forestry did not understand wildlife.

âHow a department (forest), which canât protect forests, will look after wildlife and its attached sectors,â questioned an official. He said that wildlife department had prosecuted over 62 offences in various courts for violation in Ayubia National Park as more than 200 cases were reported in other national parks of the province.

",1/14/2019,"RAWALPINDI: Federal Minister for National Health Services Aamer Mehmood Kiani here on Sunday defended the recent increase in medicine prices and linked it with the devaluation of the rupee against the dollar.

âWe will reduce the drug prices when the value of the dollar drops against the rupee. As medicines are imported, the devaluation of the rupee necessitated the increase in the prices,â he told media persons after visiting the Holy Family Hospital (HFH).

The minister said pharmaceutical companies had demanded an increase of 30pc in the drug prices but the government agreed only to 15pc.

Says prices will be reduced when value of dollar drops against the rupee

The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) on Jan 11 announced up to 15pc increase in the prices of various medicines. The surge drew criticism from the citizens and the opposition parties who demanded the government withdraw the decision as it would create problems for the people.

The minister said healthcare was ignored in the past but the PTI government was giving special attention to the sector at the direction of Prime Minister Imran Khan. He said the prime minister wanted to provide better healthcare facilities to the citizens in all government hospitals.

The minister said more than 20 million health cards would be issued by the end of this month.

âThese health cards will enable the citizens to receive medical treatment both at the government and private hospitals,â he said, adding the financial package under the health cards had also been doubled.

The government is working to establish three new hospitals and a nursing university in Islamabad to lessen the patient load on the existing hospitals.

He said after the visit of the prime minister to the HFH, 100 new beds were being added to its mother and child department.

He said the prime minister expressed his concerns after seeing two or three expecting mothers sharing a single bed in the hospital.

âThe prime minister assigned me the task to improve the facilities in the hospital so patients could get better healthcare facilities without any hurdle,â he said.

âMore than three million people get medical care annually at the HFH and it will be made a state-of-the-art hospital.â

He said for patient attendants, a shelter home was being constructed and such a facility would also be provided at Benazir Bhutto Hospital and District Headquarters Hospital.

The minister said incubators, baby carts, warmers and other facilities were also being provided to the hospital.

âThe Punjab government has been asked to ensure supply of medicines to the government hospitals,â he said.

The government will also recruit more staff to overcome the shortage in the hospitals. He said 150 employees would be recruited to improve the sanitation facilities at the HFH soon. He said new washrooms would also be constructed in the hospital.

The minister said he was monitoring the work at the hospital and the residents would seen the change within a week. He said special counters had been established at the hospital to resolve complaints of the patients.

127,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457323/number-of-pakistan-chairs-in-foreign-universities-reduced,"Number of Pakistan chairs in foreign universities reduced
",1/14/2019,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Education has decided to fill only six of the 14 vacant Pakistan chairs in foreign universities.

The ministry recently stopped the process of sending shortlisted candidates to represent Pakistan in 14 foreign universities. The candidates were finalised by a committee headed by Senator Syed Muzafar Hussain Shah last year.

The education ministry now has decided to advertise the entire process afresh.

âWe are going to re-advertise these positions within two weeks and in the first phase we will make appointments on four to six chairs instead of 14,â said the ministryâs Joint Education Adviser Rafiq Tahir.

He said in the first phase appointments would be made in important countries.

Education ministry says it will fill only six of the 14 vacant chairs abroad

Sources said because of budgetary constraints the ministry had decided to reduce the foreign chairs. Last year when the selection was finalised, there was a budget of around Rs50 million which was recently reduced by the federal government to Rs15 million.

The process to select candidates for the positions faced delay for the last around a decade. Pakistan has chairs in 14 foreign universities, including Germany, Turkey and China, which have been vacant for six to 10 years.

The chairs were set up on reciprocal basis and their holders used to deliver lectures aimed at promoting Urdu and the culture and history of Pakistan.

Earlier, the Cabinet Division used to deal with the issue but last year the function was given to the ministry of education.

A senior faculty member of Quaid-i-Azam University said chairs at international universities were a tool to build the countryâs image.

âThese chairs play an important role in promoting Pakistanâs culture and image. The appointees are academic ambassadors but unfortunately our bureaucrats are not taking this important issue seriously.â

He said India had almost 300 chairs in worldâs top university where its scholars were playing an important role to promote their countryâs interest.

A Pakistani scholar, who was shortlisted by the committee last year, said after a number of meetings he was selected but so far the education ministry has failed to complete the process.

âNow, we are being told that the process is going to be re-advertised which is unfortunate and a joke with scholars,â he said.

Last year, 28 scholars, two each against one post, were finalised by the committee. He said instead of reducing the number of chairs, the government should appoint more scholars to promote the countryâs soft image in the world.

",1/14/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Nearly a month after it was formed, the commission to review Islamabadâs master plan has yet to start working, raising the question of whether it will be able to complete its task within the stipulated six months.

The 12-member commission was formed on Dec 20 last year, but sources said an introductory meeting has not been convinced so far.

A source in the Capital Development Authority, who asked not to be named, said nearly a month â 25 days â has passed, but an initial meeting of the commission has not been called.

According to a notification issued by the Ministry of Interior on Dec 28, the chairman of the CDA will act as the convenor of the commission until someone from the private sector is appointment CDA chairman.

The current CDA chairman, Afzal Latif, is on leave for four months, and Islamabad Chief Commissioner Amer Ali Ahmed has been given additional charge of the office chairman in his absence.

Mr Ahmed was appointed on Thursday but has yet to take charge because his new assignment has not been notified.

MNA Ali Awan, adviser to the prime minister on CDA affairs, told Dawn he would look into the issue.

âThe revision of Islamabadâs master plan is highly imported as this work was not carried out in the past. We will check why the first meeting has not even been called yet,â he said.

The original developers the capitalâs master plan had recommended revising the plan every 20 years, but successive governments never made any comprehensive revisions. Instead, a number of selective amendments were made from time to time, mostly to benefit specific people.

The lack of revisions has resulted in poor planning and the proliferation of illegal construction.

The commission consists of experts tasked with revising the master plan for the next 20 years â from 2020 to 2040. It will also give its perspective on the regularisation of illegal construction in the capital.

The commissionâs terms of reference (ToR) state that it will keep in mind the increased participation of the private sector in health and education when recommending how to resolve this issue.

There are currently more than 300 private schools operating in the cityâs residential sectors, along with a large number of healthcare facilities, in violation of CDA by-laws.

The commission will also make proposals for short, medium and long-term development and may amend its ToRs with the governmentâs approval.

On Sunday, the Islamabad Guest House Association also demanded the government look into the guesthouse issue. The associationâs secretary general, Dr Osman Qazi Khan, said that the commission should look into bread and breakfasts in designated areas.

",1/14/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Khan Afridi on Sunday denied that he was friends with an alleged cocaine dealer.

According to claims circulating on social media, the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) arrested a man from an upscale part of the capital and recovered a large quantity of cocaine from his possession.

It has been claimed that the man supplied cocaine to parties in the capital and was a close friend of the state minister.

A photograph has also been circulated on social media allegedly showing the man standing beside Mr Afridi.

Mr Afridi, however, stated in a video that âcriminal-minded peopleâ had uploaded photos with him online and were âgiving the impression that they are my friends.â

He said as a political worker, he cannot stop anyone from taking photos standing beside him.

He said he had launched an anti-drugs campaign with the support of the prime minister.

âI am raising awareness against drugs on roads, on buses and in mosques. I have nothing to do with those who are seen in the pictures with me. I assume that the person took the pictures during the anti-drugs campaign. My and Imran Khanâs vision is to make the country drug-free,â he said.

Mr Afridi claimed people were trying to defame him because he was campaigning against drugs.

When contacted, ANF Director Headquarters Riaz Soomro told Dawn: âWe are still in the process of investigation, and we are not in a position to confirm or deny whether he had a link to the minister.â

He said it would be âinappropriateâ at this stage to link the suspect to the minister.

This is not the first time Mr Afridi has been linked to someone held for possessing drugs.

On Jan 7, after a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior, Mr Afridi said before the press that action would be taken against anyone caught with drugs regardless of their kinship.

Mr Afridi was then asked if he was related to Talal Nadir Afridi, who was arrested in Attock on Dec 11 for drug possession. The minister said: âWhoever he is, action will be taken against him in accordance with the law.â

He went on to say he had an extended family and his father had married thrice.

Nadir Afridi was arrested along with three others for possession of 507 grams of hashish.

The address he gave to the police was House No 3 in the Ministerâs Enclave, and he stated his fatherâs name as Farrukh Jamal Afridi.

PML-N lawmaker Hina Pervaiz Butt had submitted a resolution in the Punjab Assembly after the incident to condemn the recovery of drugs from the state ministerâs relative.

Meanwhile, in a statement, the Islamabad police claimed that 12 people were arrested for possession of liquor and drugs.

The Margalla police arrested someone allegedly involved in supply of drugs to educational institutions and recovered one kilogram hashish from him while the Secretariat police arrested two people and recovered 1.6kg hashish from them.

The Banigala police recovered 10 litres of liquor from an individual, and Noon police recovered 510gm of hashish from two people.

Khanna, Sihala, Koral and Golra police also recovered drugs and liquor from various suspects.

",1/14/2019,"RAWALPINDI: Backtracking from its previous claim of not utilising development funds through lawmakers, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab government is all set to allocate Rs100 million to each of its MPAs.

In this regard, the government has already collected development proposals from the ruling party MPAs.

In the past, the PTI criticised the PML-N for utilising development funds through its parliamentarians. But after coming to power in Punjab, the party sought development proposals from its members of the provincial assembly.

A senior leader of the party told Dawn that the MPAs submitted their development proposals to the government last month but due to the financial crisis the funds were yet to be released.

âPTIâs parliamentary meeting is scheduled to be held in Lahore on Monday to discuss issues pertaining to the ruling party members in their respective districts. The MPAs will ask the provincial government to start development works.â

Punjab govt collects proposals from ruling party lawmakers to carry out development works worth Rs100m each

He said the ruling party members had also decided to raise the issue of bureaucracy as senior officials of the district administrations were not cooperating with them to resolve problems of the citizens.

He said the MPAs also wanted to launch new projects in their areas, especially in those union councils which were neglected during the tenure of the PML-N government.

He said the party also wanted to change the local government system in the province as at present the PML-N has a majority in all the municipal corporations and district councils. Any changes to the local government law could only be made through the provincial assembly but the PTI does not have the required majority in the house.

In this situation, he added, the provincial government had allocated Rs100 million for each ruling party MPA and asked them to submit their development proposals.

âWe have submitted the development proposals to the Punjab government which would release the funds soon,â Chaudhry Adnan, PTI MPA from Rawalpindi city, told Dawn.

He said there was a dire need to launch new projects in many areas as the previous government remained busy in executing projects to make commissions.

âThe shortage of water and other issues were ignored in the past and being elected representatives of the people it is our duty to inform the government about it,â he said.

The MPA said the PTI lawmakers had presented their proposals to the government which would spend funds on the sectors as pointed out by the MPAs.

When contacted, MPA Umer Tanveer of the PTI said the development funds would be spent by the government and the role of the ruling party MPAs was only to identify problems of the residents.

âThe provincial government allocated Rs100 million for each constituency and in this regard we will give a presentation in the parliamentary meeting on Jan 14,â he said.

The government would also resolve problems of the citizens in the cantonment areas as the proposals included water supply schemes.

On the other hand, a senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the previous PML-N government in Punjab made a political move before the general elections by preparing the development plan in 2018 and launching many projects.

âMore than 50pc work on the projects had been completed on these development schemes worth over Rs3 billion and the provincial government would not take the risk of stopping work on them. These projects have to be completed before launching new schemes.â

The official said the government was facing problems to start new schemes before completing the ongoing ones.

âIt is the basic reason behind the delay in the release of funds for the new projects. But the MPAs are hopeful to arrange funds for development schemes in their areas,â he said.

",1/14/2019,"LAHORE: PPP Information Secretary Dr Nafisa Shah says new disclosures are being made about the PTI daily as its leadership is involved in corruption.

Speaking at a press conference along with Munawwar Anjum and Hassan Murtaza here on Sunday, she recalled that the PTI election manifesto was anti-corruption and one Pakistan for all. But, after coming into power, it adopted double standards on corruption, she said.

She said prime ministerâs sister Aleema Khan who is caretaker of Shaukat Khanum Hospitalâs donations, had been found to be owning $450 million property in New Jersey, US declared in the amnesty scheme in 2017. She asked whether the demand by opposition for investigation of the affair was just or not.

Likewise, she said, financial affairs and contracts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government during the last five years as well as fake accounts of the PTI funds must also be probed.

The PPP leader said Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Afridi talked of use of drugs by Islamabad college girls but the fact is that his own nephew had been caught smuggling drugs and Mr Afridi should decide his punishment on his own.

She told a questioner that the PPP would move every forum including courts against Aleema Khan, Imran Khan, Jahangir Tareen, Aleem Khan and others.

She lamented that names of her party leaders were placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) on the report of a so-called JIT and that despite the Supreme Court orders the same were not being removed from the list. Whereas, she pointed out, the name of Liaquat Jatoi was removed from the list despite investigation.

Ms Shah chided the finance minister for changing stance on national economy. She said Asad Umar took third U-turn in six months as he said Islamabad was not going to the IMF but was giving a second budget. She asked which government would give a second budget in six months.

Responding to a question, she said Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had talked of march on Islamabad on the basis of issues unlike Imran Khanâs attack on parliament. âWe are in contact with the masses. With the support of the masses weâll march on Islamabad when the conditions will become intolerable.â

Answering another question, she said the PPP had taken a principled stance against military courts.

According to park officials, the 40-year-old rhino has been âsickâ for the last few days and was found dead in the artificial lake in the enclave where she lived with the male rhino. Her body was retrieved from the lake after hectic efforts, the officials added.

The pair of rhinos was gifted to Pakistan by Nepal in 1982. On the orders of the then Punjab governor Gen Ghulam Jillani, the pair was housed at the National Park, Lal Sohanra.

The then park administrator late Maj Syed Manzoor Hussain Shah got built a trench-cum-lake for the pair where they used to bath and relax for hours to the joy of those visiting the park, especially the children.

As per park sources, the female rhino was pregnant and had a miscarriage a few days back and might have died because of excessive bleeding that had weakened her.

They said the female rhino had a stillbirth last year.

Park Conservator Javed Gill, who is also the administrator of the facility, told Dawn that a rhinoâs average lifespan was 60-70 years and the female could complete around half of it in captivity.

He said a postmortem examination of the dead beast had been ordered to determine the cause of death.

",1/14/2019,"LAHORE: Political parties are now being run through a remote-control mechanism as one cannot talk against the security establishment even in internal discourse, says the Awami National Party leader Afrasiab Khattak.

He was speaking on âProgressive Politics in Pakistanâ at ThinkFest here on Sunday.

Terming the prevailing judicial activism a âjudicial martial lawâ, he alleged that the Supreme Court chief justice was usurping the executiveâs authority.

He called for signing of a document by all political parties like the Charter of Democracy (CoD) to regain the space lost to undemocratic forces. He also talked of lack of democracy within the parties and urged their leaders to rectify the situation to be on a high moral ground in the struggle against undemocratic forces.

Awami Workersâ Partyâs Tooba Syed held the âcatharsisâ of activists through social media responsible for their reluctance to join actual political movements.

The Friday Times editor Aima Khosa didnât see any progressive movement in the country for the time being, blaming it on a lack of tradition and contemporary difficult conditions. She said the activists needed cadre organisation and political training for becoming part of such organizations.

Akbar S Zaidi, who conducted the session, didnât agree with Ms Khosa and said in fact difficult conditions enhanced the role and even gave birth to such movements and organisations.

Responding to queries from the audience, Mr Khattak admitted political parties suffered because of not embracing new classes like youth and the urban middle class, while these could not adjust themselves to the changes in political discourse and issues that emerged in the post-Zia period.

In the session on âGrowth, IMF and Pakistan Economyâ, former finance minister Salman Shah called for improving agriculture productivity through better water management, diverting Chinese investment, special economic zones, renegotiating free trade agreement with China to check its tilt towards Beijing, introducing public-private partnership concept in infrastructure development.

Miftah Ismael, who was financial advisor during PML-N government, downplayed the fears of Pakistan being put on black list by the FATF saying the country had earlier been on the list (without any serious harm) in 2008-09.

He said Islamabad could not substitute imports with exports for want of costly raw material used in many industries. Talking of lack of foreign visitors, he said at Dhaka more foreign airliners landed than Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore combined.

Ex-finance minister Hafeez Pasha advised the rulers not to (negatively) touch the National Finance Commission award issues and called for reducing the size of bureaucratic setup in Islamabad.

The chief minister was speaking to the media after attending the Valima ceremony of former MPA Syed Jawed Ali Shahâs son here on Sunday.

He said he had undertaken just a couple of private foreign tours so far since becoming the chief minister. âBy the way, I donât intend to go abroad in near future,â he added.

Mr Shah said he was not worried about placement of his name on the exit control list (ECL).

âImran Khan is the Prime Minister of the country; he is free to go anywhere he wants to go,â the CM said.

He said no conspiracy against his government would succeed. âThose sitting in Islamabad ought to tell me which of his or his governmentâs act had actually angered them,â he added.

In reply to a question, he said it was the media that keenly projected the unparliamentary language uttered guests at various programmes and other people. âIf the media stops this practice, the trend will certainly die down,â he argued.

Answering a question about future of military courts, the chief minister said that his party had already conveyed its stance on the subject to the authorities concerned.

",1/14/2019,"SUKKUR: The Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), currently engaged in political manoeuvring amid persisting uncertainty about future of the Sindh government, held a crucial meeting on Sunday at Gohar Palace in Khangarh, Ghotki district, ahead of Prime Minister Imran Khanâs Jan 27 visit to Sindh.

The meeting was presided over by GDA chief Pir Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi (Pir Sahib Pagara) and attended by other top alliance leaders including Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi, Ayaz Latif Palijo, Dr Hasnain Mirza, Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim, Irfanullah Marwat, Ghulam Murtaza Jatoi, Ghous Bakhsh Khan Mahar and the host, MPA Sardar Ali Gohar Khan Mahar.

Speaking to the media after the meeting, both Sardar Mahar and GDA secretary general Ayaz Palijo said that a âchangeâ in Sindh through constitutional means was discussed. They said the alliance would continue to support Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf as its ally at the Centre as there was a consensus among leaderships of both entities, as well as all other stakeholders of the state, on rooting out corruption from the country.

âConstitutional changeâ in Sindh discussed, required support within assembly claimed

Regarding GDAâs efforts to dislodge Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) from power corridors in Sindh, Mr Palijo argued that the PPP government had destroyed the agriculture sector in the province over the decade-long rule over it, besides plaguing all departments with corruption.

âThey have devastated growers in Sindh,â he said, adding that the province was not getting its due share in the Indus water while Wapda and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) remained indifferent to the issue.

Mr Palijo categorically stated that the GDA would not support any unconstitutional move aimed about a change of government in Sindh. He said GDA would play a vital role in bringing about such a change through constitutional moves. âThere are dozens of members of the Sindh Assembly in contact with Pir Pagara and Sardar Ali Gohar Khan Mahar who are willing to support such a move,â he said.

He said GDA had already started mobilising public support from Ghotki district and similar efforts would be made in all other districts very soon. He said GDAâs aim was to make the country corruption-free.

Any strategy in this regard, if chalked out, would certainly be a joint effort of the GDA and PTI, he said.

Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi told the media said there would be an in-house change in the Sindh Assembly. It would not come through unconstitutional means, he said, adding that GDA would not be part of any unconstitutional change.

Referring to PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardariâs warning to the PTI government over a possible âinvasion of Islamabadâ by oppressed people of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pir Rashdi said: âThe Zardari party is not strong enough to invade even Ghotki let alone Islamabad ... the party has done massive corruption in Sindh ... they have to face accountability firstâ

Commenting on Prime Ministerâs scheduled visit to Ghotki, MPA Ali Gohar Mahar said that he would seek a big package for Sindh from the Centre which should include establishment of a university in Ghotki.

He said many areas of the district were without gas though it was the first area of Sindh where natural gas was discovered in 1993 and first well of the province was sunk here. No other benefits were being given to Ghotki against the gas deposits and supplies.

Former chief minister Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim said that the prime minister was coming to Sindh to know about the issues confronting Sindh. He said Mr Khan would be apprised of all pressing issues. He said there were certain issues supposed to be addressed by the provincial government but it was shifting all responsibilities to the federal government.

He hinted that a change in Sindh was imminent âonce the accountability process in the province is completedâ.

After the meeting, Pir Pagara left for the Tar Ghar bungalow â the residence of Sardar Ali Gohar Mahar in Sardar Garh â for an overnight stay.

",1/14/2019,"KARACHI: The chief provincial law officer said on Saturday that the Supreme Court-mandated commission on water and sanitation in Sindh needed to continue till its objectives were completely accomplished.

When the commission, which is set to complete its tenure on Jan 15, resumed its sitting, Advocate General, Sindh, Salman Talibuddin made a statement on the behalf of the provincial government.

He appreciated the working of the commission and said that its tenure should be extended since many ongoing schemes would be better monitored by the commission while a number of other schemes were in a formative stage.

The AG also tendered an apology regarding the comments of an additional advocate general made about the commission last week before the Supreme Court when its final report was submitted in the apex court.

He further said that when the same matter would be taken up for hearing by the apex court on Monday, the law officer of Sindh will record âno objectionâ to the commissionâs final report.

Shahab Usto, who had petitioned the apex court regarding water and sanitation issues in Sindh, also endorsed the proposal of the advocate general regarding continuation of the commission.

However, the commission, headed by retried Justice Amir Hani Muslim, said that it was the sole domain of the Supreme Court to consider such a request independently.

Justice Muslim had already requested the apex court that he was stepping down upon the completion of his tenure on Jan 15 due to personal reasons and the Supreme Court had also allowed it.

",1/14/2019,"KARACHI: A man, who had filed a petition in court for the recovery of his estranged âwifeâ and three daughters, allegedly gunned down the 37-year-old man with whom his wife and the children were living in a flat in a New Town locality on Sunday in front of policemen, officials said.

They added that the police with the petitioner had gone to the flat to arrest the man on a court order to present the petitionerâs wife and his three daughters in court on the next hearing of the case.

âAn incident of firing took place within the remit of the New Town police station when the additional SHO Darakhshan went with applicant Sohail Mughal on a court order to arrest Munawar Ali,â said Karachi East SSP Azfar Mahesar.

Gulshan SP Tahir Noorani told media that Sohail Mughal had filed an abduction case of his family against Munawar Ali, which was quashed by the court.

However, the court directed the Darakshan police on Dec 31, 2018 on a petition of the suspect to recover the suspectâs three daughters and wife and present them in court on Jan 17, East SSP Azfar Mahesar said.

The petitioner was present during the last hearing of the case and stated that the âpolice authorities have not produced the ladiesâ.

He had urged the court to issue an âappropriate actionâ against the respondents.

The New Town police officer in whose jurisdiction the incident took place told Dawn that when petitioner Sohail Mughal with the additional SHO of Darakhshan arrived at the apartment in Sharafabad, Munawar Ali was already present at the gate of the multi-storey building.

However, before the police could arrest him, Mughal, who had hidden a 9mm pistol in his shalwar, took out the gun and opened fire on Munawar.

He fired four shots as a result of which Munawar sustained two bullet wounds and was taken by the additional SHO to the Liaquat National Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Later, the body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.

Dr Seemin Jamali, executive director of the hospital, said that Munawar had received two bullet wounds on his chest and abdomen.

The police arrested Sohail Mughal with the pistol and collected spent bullet casings from the crime scene.

The New Town police officer said that neighbours told the police that the suspectâs wife had taken âdivorceâ from him and was living with Munawar Ali with her three daughters.

The police detained the additional SHO of Darakhshan with other policemen on charges of criminal negligence.

DIG East Amir Farooqi said a murder case would be registered against Sohail Mughal and another case pertaining to criminal negligence against the Darakhshan policemen.

",1/14/2019,"KARACHI: Police resorted to baton-charge in an attempt to maintain order at the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, where thousands of young jobless persons, who came from all over Sindh, congregated on Sunday for walk-in interviews the hospital had announced for 300 lower-grade jobs.

The hospital administration said more than 12,000 people had arrived for interviews. The police, however, offered a figure of around 30,000.

It was beyond expectations for the hospital administration, yet the happenings reflected how grave the issue of unemployment was.

While witnesses said police resorted to baton-charge, a senior police officer denied that the police took such an action against the people gathered there.

The witnesses said the candidates had begun arriving outside the hospital since the early hours of Sunday morning. Many of them had graduate degrees, yet they wanted the jobs because of unemployment.

The long queues soon turned into unruly gatherings before all that merged into a mob that was restless and raucous, yet they restrained themselves from becoming violent.

Some of the candidates came for walk-in interviews were seen climbing the barricades formed by the hospital administration and the local police. A number of them clambered to the rooftop.

Policeâs decision to adopt mild tactics saved the day and stemmed the situation from going even graver and, fortunately, the general anguish remained suppressed and failed to create stampede.

The situation, however, warranted for further fortification and the paramilitary Rangers were called in.

The hospital had established 13 places â eight for men, four for women and one for the disabled persons â to take interviews of candidates.

Witnesses said although the counters for men, women and disabled persons were safely distant from each other outside the outpatient department of the hospital, yet, the hullaballoo at the menâs counters created concern on other areas.

âThere were dozens of disabled persons and some of them could not get the tokens for interviews because of the chaos and they returned,â said a witness.

Another said the situation at the womenâs counters remained normal where it was ensured â both by the candidates and the administration â to maintain calm.

SSP-City Muquddus Haider told Dawn that the police had advised the hospital administration that they should conduct interviews of the candidates in phases on different days to avoid a stampede-like situation and ensure the order but their advice was ostensibly not entertained by the authorities at the health facility.

The officer said people had arrived from across Sindh along with their relatives.

He also denied reports that the police resorted to baton-charge.

Another officer, Eidgah SHO Nadeem Haider said several thousand people had gathered outside the hospital for interviews.

The medical superintendent of the hospital said they had offered 300 jobs for lower grades for which they had called direct interviews.

âRest assured,â said hospitalâs medical superintendent Dr Sabir Memon, âeveryone who has come here will be interviewed; no matter, how much time it takes. We are here to manage all this.â

A senior health official said: âEverything is normal now. The recruitment is being made in accordance with the set SOPs [standard operating procedures].â

",1/14/2019,"KARACHI: The trial pertaining to extrajudicial killing of aspiring Waziristan model Naqeeb Ullah Mehsud and three others in an staged encounter has yet to formally begin, as the main suspect, former SSP Rao Anwar, and his 25 subordinates have not been indicted one year after the incident, it emerged on Sunday.

SSP Rao Anwar with his subordinates has been booked for killing Naqeeb and three others after dubbing them âTaliban militantsâ in a âfakeâ shoot-out on Jan 13, 2018.

The Anti-Terrorism Court No 2 had granted bail to Rao in the two cases pertaining to the kidnapping and murder as well as registering fake criminal cases against the victims in July last.

An antiterrorism court is set to announce order on bail pleas of 10 policemen today

The killing of the young Mehsud had sparked widespread protests by the civil society and Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar took suo motu notice of the killings.

After eluding law enforcers for two months and upon being offered opportunities by the CJP to surrender, the former SSP had finally appeared before the Supreme Court and was subsequently arrested in Islamabad.

Instead of detaining him in the Karachi central prison, jail authorities had shifted him to a house due to alleged security concerns, declaring it a sub-jail in the Malir Cantonment area.

Four other suspects â former DSP Qamar, Muhammad Yaseen, Supurd Hussain and Khizar Hayat â have also been granted bail.

After slain modelâs father Khan Muhammad Mehsud, who is the complainant in the main case, showed no confidence in the ATC-II, the Sindh High Court had transferred the cases to the ATC-III on Nov 5.

âThe formal trial has not taken off so far because none of the suspects has been indicted by the trial court in the cases,â Advocate Salahuddin Panhwar, the counsel for the complainant Mehsud, had told Dawn after attending the last hearing on Jan 6.

On the last hearing, the ATC-III had reserved its order on applications filed by 10 police officials, who remained absconding for as many months and then approached the court seeking pre-arrest bail to avoid their arrest in the cases.

âThe court will announce its verdict on their bail pleas on Jan 14 [today],â judicial staff told Dawn, adding that the hearing in the main case was fixed for Jan 30.

Around six suspended police officials â Sub-Inspector Sheikh Mohammad Shoaib alias Shoaib Shooter, SI Gada Hussain, SI Amanullah Marwat, Head Constable Shafqat Hussain, Constables Mohsin Abbas, Raja Shamim, Rana Riaz â are still absconding in the case.

Police probe finds Rao Anwar, others guilty

On May 2, 2018 the trial court had accepted a supplementary investigation report submitted by investigating officer SSP Dr Rizwan Ahmed, who had charge-sheeted all the suspended policemen in the cases.

The supplementary charge sheet that mentioned that the forensic reports of the weapons, a technical analysis of the call detail records (CDR), TV interviews of Rao Anwar and circumstantial evidence suggested the involvement of Rao Anwar and his team members in the extrajudicial killing and dubbing the victims as terrorists.

There was no criminal record of the victims against whom the suspects had highlighted âfake stories in the mediaâ to hush up the extrajudicial killings, the supplementary charge sheet said, alleging that during the investigation the nominated policemen were also found involved in destroying evidence, misusing their official authority in an attempt to cover up their other unlawful acts.

It further mentioned that in the light of all the evidence and statements of the witnesses, the arrested suspects, including Rao Anwar, were involved in kidnapping for ransom, murder and destruction of the evidence.

It had stated that the CDR showed the presence of Rao Anwar at the crime scene between 2.55am and 3.21am, adding that his presence was also recorded near the New Sabzi Mandi on Superhighway on Jan 4, 5, 8, 9 and 13.

The CDR analysis further revealed that PC Feroze, former SHO Marwat and ASI Hussain were present at the crime scene together on Jan 12, 2018 while the presence of SI Anwar, ASI Hussain, ASI Khair Mohammad and Raja Shamim was also recorded on Jan 13 last year.

It showed that PC Feroze and ASI Hussain contacted each other through mobile phones 18 times on the day of the incident and a day before it while PC Feroze also changed his mobile SIM cards and mobile phones several times after the incident.

âThe digital evidence show the important role of the suspects in planning and execution of the fake encounter, while it also suggest their involvement in failure to report the crime and abetting the police party in the fake encounter,â it stated.

The CDR analysis further showed that mobile phones of Mohsin Abbas and Raja Riaz were switched off at the time of the encounter and former DSP Qamar Ahmed had constantly been in contact with the police involved in the fake encounter.

It further mentioned that former ASI Allahyar, former HC Mohammad Iqbal, former constables Arshad Ali, Ghulam Nazik, Shafiq Ahmed and Abdul Wali were found involved in kidnapping Naqeeb and his friends from the Sher Agha hotel and taking them to the Abbas Town police post and trying to cover up the whole episode, which was an offence under the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

It added that former constables Abbas and Imran Kazmi were found involved in the kidnapping, torture and demanding ransom for the victimsâ release.

It said former ASI Akbar Mallahâs role in the fake encounter was determined while the former DSP was found involved in making entries of the fake encounter, tampering with the evidence and facilitating the police party involved in fake encounter.

The supplementary charge sheet revealed that there was no criminal record of the victims against whom the suspects had highlighted fake stories in the media to hush up the extrajudicial killings. The police were also found involved in destroying the evidence, misusing their official authority in an attempt to cover up their other unlawful acts.

The supplementary charge sheet mentioned that in the light of all the evidence and statements of the witnesses, the arrested suspects, including Rao Anwar, were involved in kidnapping for ransom, murder and destroying the evidence.

Court yet to take up eyewitnessâs affidavit

The trial court has yet to consider a personal affidavit filed by HC Shahzada Jahangir in which he deviated from his initial statement given to the police against Rao Anwar and his subordinates regarding their involvement in the extrajudicial killing.

In the affidavit, he said that he was not present at the place of the incident on January 13, 2018.

Deviating from his earlier statement, Jahangir stated that after seven or eight days of his arrest he was threatened and forced to give a statement. He had alleged that he was coerced to give the statement, which was not based on facts and the police had tortured him.

Earlier, he had told the IO that he was a close aide of then Shah Latif Town SHO Marwat, who on Jan 13 called him at the place of incident and upon arriving there he found the SHO and other police officials present there while the four detained men were also in their custody.

In the meantime, Rao Anwar, DSP Qamar, then SHO Shaikh and other police officials also arrived there and then Marwat, Shoaib and others took the detained men to an abandoned poultry farm, he said, adding that they heard gunshots and thereafter Marwat and other police officials came out of the poultry farm and asked him to do the paperwork.

141,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457310/why-do-ethnicities-tend-to-gravitate-towards-certain-professions,"Why do ethnicities tend to gravitate towards certain professions?
",1/14/2019,"PAKISTANâS labour market segmentation shows the concentration of ethnicities along occupational lines. The ethnic composition in several professions, however, is visibly changing. For policymakers this insight can be helpful for developing effective interventions to better harness the countryâs most valuable asset: its human capital.

Several economic, political and social factors push ethnic groups towards specific occupations. Generally, it appears that the choice of occupation is a cumulative function of an individualâs human and social capital and position on the social scale.

Currently the national labour database does not shed light on this dimension. The Labour Force Survey 2017-18 launched and posted on the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) last week did not reveal the ethnic composition of the labour force in Pakistan.

Shaista Sohail, secretary PBS, who holds an additional charge of chief statistician, joined the organisation last month. She acknowledged weaknesses in the current database of the country.

âWe wish to make data truly reflective of the reality by improving its efficacy. The organisation is in the process of transformation. Instead of limiting change to administrative steps we wish to invite International Labour Organisation experts and representatives of civil society, to bring about necessary changes in the methodology and the framework of data collection and processing,â she told Dawn over phone from Islamabad.

âFor a better understanding of the quiet societal transformation, it would also be relevant to probe the reasons for the domination of certain ethnicities in specific occupations. The starting point, however, is to collect dataâ

âI believe that the participation rate of women is under-reported as we can see an increasing number of ladies serving in the retail and fast food chains, etc. It is also absolutely necessary to improve the quality of agriculture data to include information on organic farming in Pakistan,â she said.

âWe are considering inducting young people and trained analysts to make this organisation dynamic so that it may better serve its purpose and assist policymakers and researchers,â Ms Sohail concluded.

In Pakistan, quite a few preconceived perceptions regarding professions based on ethnicity abound. These include: martial services are supposed to be mostly dominated by people from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; transporters, cobblers, unskilled construction workers are apparently more often Pakhtuns.

Other popular perceptions include: pharmacists and sweatmeat merchants are supposed to be dominated by Sindhis, low-grade civil servants, semi-skilled workers and khepias (agents who make foreign visits for the informal sale-purchase of goods) are thought to be disproportionately Urdu speaking, stockbrokers and gold merchants are supposed to be mostly Memons, while most carpenters and nurses are conceived to be Punjabis.

Shaukat Khattak, a senior officer informed that national labour statistics are survey based. âPBS carries out an extensive exercise to collect labour data. In all, 42,000 households are surveyed in four provinces and 6,000 are surveyed in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The survey form currently does not include a question on ethnicity of respondents though we do ask about the profession,â he commented.

The Labour Survey 2017-18 makes very broad 22 occupational classifications but does not go beyond gender and rural-urban dimensions. Retail and mechanics are clubbed together. Transport and storage is one category. Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply is another classification.

According to the current data 38.4 per cent of labour is absorbed in agriculture, forestry and fishing, 16.5pc in manufacturing, 14pc in wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles account for 14.9pc, transport and storage for 5.6pc and public administration, defence and compulsory social security for 2.4pc and other services activities for 2.1pc. Participation in all other categories is less than 1pc.

Some occupations in Pakistan may still have specific ethnicities dominating them but this trend has weakened with urbanisation and the influx of people of other nationalities in every profession, it is observed.

âFor a better understanding of the quiet societal transformation it would also be relevant to probe the reasons for domination of certain ethnicities in specific occupations. The starting point, however, is to collect data that sheds some light on this dimension of the labour market.

âThis information may help carve out strategies of cross-ethnic harmony based on policies insuring equal opportunity for all as the country learned the hard way the pitfalls of ethnic discrimination when the East-wing seceded,â commented an analyst.

âIt is only when people are treated by the ruling clique as an asset and not a liability that they start caring to dissect data for evidence-based planning to improve governance quality, ensure equitable sharing and equal opportunity. Currently, disparities are rampant in Pakistan. It is hoped that a stable democratic government will prove to be more caring,â he added.

142,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457312/sindh-should-take-a-leaf-from-punjabs-book-to-fight-drought,"Sindh should take a leaf from Punjabâs book to fight drought
",1/14/2019,"The year began in Tharparkar â Pakistanâs biggest arid region with large human and livestock populations â with inhabitants facing drought yet again.

Droughts and famines are a regular feature of life in Tharparkar. Barring a few pockets that received rainfall in 2017, the rest of the area has not been getting any rain for the last four years. Locals believe droughts usually come to an end with enough rainfall that enables the farming community to grow seasonal crops and produce sufficient fodder for livestock, which is their prime asset.

Tharâs agro-pastoral life revolves around water and fodder. Provincial and federal governments tend to address the issues faced by the local population using a relief-based approach. A sustainable, institutional oversight has so far eluded this least developed region where people endure harsh conditions regularly. This is despite the fact that Thar is blessed with a fascinating landscape that mesmerises tourists after every monsoon rainfall.

Climate change has also affected the rainfall cycle in Thar, which receives the annual drizzle around August-September. But the May-July period is considered ideal for the sowing of crops as farmers hope to have better per-acre yields in the seasonal crops like bajra. Late sowing in September leads to lower yields.

No permanent arrangement to ensure fodder availability exists in Thar, although livestock plays a central role in sustaining economic life in the area

Every drought triggers migration among communities. This migration is in addition to the seasonal ones that take place at the time of cotton-picking or sugar cane and wheat harvesting. Groundwater levels drop considerably in the absence of rainfall. Livestock, which is the communityâs only source of livelihood, forces them to leave their area in search of fodder and water in canal command areas.

No permanent arrangement for fodder availability, like fodder banks, exists in Tharparkar during the drought. This is despite the fact that livestock plays a central role in sustaining economic life in the area. It provides them with milk and butter, but animals suffer a loss of immunity during every drought. As a result, milk production drops considerably, causing undernourishment especially among expecting mothers. This makes the survival of malnourished newborns difficult.

Based on the projected animal population number and the human population of 1.6 million as per the latest census, one individual maintains around four animals in Tharparkar. Immunity loss necessitates preventive vaccination among animals, but its coverage is hardly 20pc in Sindh for want of resources, an official admitted.

The livestock sector has a share of 58.92pc within the countryâs agriculture sector, which contributed 18.9pc to GDP as per the 2017-18 Economic Survey of Pakistan. The estimated livestock population in 2017 was 41.68m in Sindh. About 6m of them were in Tharparkar, according to Sindhâs livestock department. It makes Thar the district with the highest livestock population.

âWe get hardly 25pc vaccination coverage in Sindh and the same goes for Thar,â said a senior livestock department officer. âBut there has luckily been no major disaster as the livestock department has hired additional manpower and resources from other districts for vaccination. Thatâs why the department didnât draw the ire of the chief justice of Pakistan,â he added.

Changing climatic conditions are causing multiple challenges for Tharparkar, which calls for a paradigm shift at the policy level. The Sindh government needs to look beyond hurried livestock vaccination, wheat distribution and reverse osmosis plants. An increase in livestockâs budgetary allocations â currently Rs1.3bn â is badly needed.

The Punjab governmentâs initiatives in the arid region of Cholistan offer a cue. As opposed to Thar, Cholistan seems relatively better managed. This is why it has not had any disaster of the kind that Thar has witnessed. The Cholistan area, consisting of 29,000 square kilometres, is spread over Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur and Rahimyar Khan. The Punjab government has also established the Cholistan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences in Bahawalpur, which is affiliated with Glasgow University.

Cholistan, however, had a smaller estimated human population of roughly 220,000 in 2017 along with 1.6m heads of livestock. The Punjab governmentâs Cholistan Development Authority (CDA) deals with this area exclusively. Within the provincial livestock department, a directorate looks after the affairs of Cholistan.

Dr Ali Raza Abbasi, CDAâs directorate head, considers the drought an opportunity. âWe provide livestock farmers with wanda (feed supplement) on a cost-to-cost basis throughout the year at fixed entry/exit points,â he said. He added that ponds are built in the area for human and livestock populations in addition to an old natural waterway that is connected with pumping stations.

Since 2018, he said, his department has been buying camel milk for Rs42 per litre and keeping it in chillers. It is then sold for Rs120 per litre in Lahore. He said that the department also purchased cattle milk in 2010. But the private firmsâ intervention jacked up the market price, which benefited farmers. âThe animal vaccination coverage in 100pc,â he remarked.

Around 17 chillers (out of 153 in Sindh) were set up in Thar. But those were part of the foreign-funded Sindh Agriculture Growth Project (SAGP). Reportedly, only three of them are functioning. Since a large number of livestock left Thar for want for fodder, milk could not be collected in the rest of the chillers. The provincial livestock department has provided three livestock farmers with solar-powered submersible pumps to lift groundwater and grow fodder on an experimental basis.

Indiaâs Rajasthan and Pakistanâs Thar and Cholistan are part of the same region, said former chairman of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), Dr Mohammad Ashraf. He said reverse osmosis plants are not a solution to Tharâs woes. âManaging these plants is difficult even in urban areas. The Sindh government needs to focus more on rainwater harvesting projects in Thar,â he said.

A draft of the Sindh Drought and Disaster Mitigation Policy 2014 was prepared following the 2014 drought. It proposed that a Thar Development Authority be set up in the area along the lines of CDA. The Sindh Assemblyâs relevant committee has okayed the policy, but it still needs the legislatureâs nod.

",1/14/2019,"QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani has refuted ârumours of differencesâ in the ruling Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and said that no one can create a rift in the party which is making efforts for development of the province and prosperity of the people.

According to reports, differences have emerged in the BAP over its candidate for a Senate seat from Balochistan which has fallen vacant after death of Sardar Azam Khan Musakhail.

However, Mr Alyani, who is also president of the BAP, said, âSome elements which are spreading rumours about differences in the party on social media canât even win union council elections. They are trying to create misunderstanding within the party.â

CM says opponents canât swallow better performance of his govt

âThe BAP is united and making efforts to secure rights of Balochistan and solve the problems being faced by the people of the province,â he said in a statement issued here on Sunday.

The chief minister said, âWe contested general elections under the slogan of âprosperous Balochistanâ and are trying to implement the manifesto of the party.â However, he added, some people were spreading negative propaganda against the party with rumours that it had weakened.

He criticised previous provincial governments alleging that during their tenures, jobs were sold at high prices and Balochistan remained backward due to their negligence to the issues being faced by the province.

He said that the rulers running the previous governments did not pay attention to the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) that kept Balochistan a poor and deprived province.

Mr Alyani said that his government was making all out efforts to bring a positive and progressive change in the life of the people of Balochistan.

He said that his government would continue making efforts to improve the situation in the province through providing basic facilities to the people and solving their problems.

Referring to the opponentsâ criticism on the provincial governmentâs performance, the CM said those irresponsible politicians could not swallow the performance of the government over the last four months,

âOur government has made record legislation and taken action over major issues the province is facing. Seven meetings of the provincial cabinet have been held so far in which important decisions were taken on the PSDP in the interest of the people of Balochistan,â he said.

Lauding the support of coalition partners, the chief minister said, âThey have been supporting us in making decisions for better future of the province.â

The clash reportedly erupted over the removal of a âdysfunctionalâ power transformer which fed a tube well irrigating the farmland.

Villagers in the nearby farm claimed that heavy firing was heard for 50 minutes. Sources said that 13 tenants and four security personnel of the farm were injured in the clash.

Rescue 1122 sources confirmed that they shifted the injured to the Baiel Ganj Basic Health Unit and the Pakpattan DHQ Hospital.

Pakpattan Health Authority CEO Imtiaz Rana told the media that emergency was declared in the DHQ Hospital. The sources said Mamshad Ahmed, son of Haji Manzoor, succumbed to his wounds sustained in the clash.

As police did not reportedly register the case, some 500 residents and Mazareen from Farid Nagar Colony, adjacent to the farm, marched in protest towards the Pakpattan police chief office.

Carrying the workerâs body, the protesters demanded the registration of an FIR against the culprits.

Later, the protesters assembled outside the deputy commissionerâs office where the sit-in continued for over four hours.

Sources in police confirmed that the DPO office had to call reserve police force to avoid any possible clash around the farm. They said the road connecting Pakpattan with Deepalpur and Kasur had been closed.

The sit-in ended when Â­a three-member committee comprising Deputy ComÂ­misÂ­sioner Ahmed Kamal Maan, DPO Mariya MahÂ­mood and SP Investigation Syed Abbas Shah met the protest leaders.

Mr Maan told Dawn by phone that the protesters dispersed after an assurance that FIR would be registered under the law.

146,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457463/nab-accused-of-harassing-metro-bus-project-contractors,"NAB accused of harassing Metro bus project contractors
",1/14/2019,"ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has been accused of setting an example of âharassmentâ in the case of the Multan Metro Bus Project (MMBP) as the countryâs top of the line contractors involved in the project are on bail to avoid their arrest.

According to the Contractors Association of Pakistan (CAP), NAB has challenged engineering estimates made by the Multan Development Authority (MDA) much before the award of the Rs28 billion MMBP contract. Thus the contractors had nothing to do with preparation of these estimates. The only charge is that the engineering estimates were high and led to a loss of Rs1.7bn to the national exchequer. Meanwhile, over Rs3.2bn dues of the contractors are yet to be paid by the MDA.

NAB claims that it has to recover Rs1.7bn from the contractors and, therefore, the anti-graft watchdog is running after the contractors to arrest them, the CAP says. However, the MDA owes twice this amount to the contractors, it adds.

The opposition believes that NABâs case is weak and the bureau is just using tactics for arm-twisting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leaders by implicating them in the MMBP case.

The contractorsâ association has written a letter to NAB Chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal, complaining that audit objections are being treated as criminal cases.

In the letter, the CAP has asked the NAB chief to ensure a fair and transparent probe into mega development projects and expressed the fear that âharassment will drive away investorsâ.

The CAP has alleged that despite meeting legal requirements and procedures, a group of contractors engaged in the project is being harassed and victimised.

The MMBP was launched in June 2015 and the bus service was inaugurated by the then chief minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, in Jan 2017.

Six top-ranking national and international firms had taken part in the execution of the MMBP. They completed the project two years ago and almost all of them are presently engaged in other national projects.

A source told Dawn that the heads of six firms, who worked on different segments of the MMBP, had obtained pre-arrest bail from court, but the head of another company, who could not get bail, had been arrested by NAB.

The CAP has assured NAB of its support in the probe into the Metro bus project or any other construction project, but said: âWe feel that complex construction issues and disputes between construction companies and the government are being dragged into criminal jurisdiction.

âThis appears to be due to lack of understanding and expertise of NABâs investigation officers with International Federation of Consulting Engineers [FIDIC] conditions, besides other complex technical and contractual matters.â

The letter says that contractual disputes and audit objections need to be segregated from criminal proceedings.

It has said that the construction sector of Pakistan is running businesses worth trillions of rupees, giving employment to millions of people and making huge investments.

âIt may also be considered that we are the engines of growth and contribute towards national economy in various ways by paying direct and indirect taxes, generating direct and indirect employment, driving the steel, cement, glass and tiles industries as being major consumers of such products,â the CAP letter says.

The contractorsâ association has said: âWe are the ones building dams, roads, motorways, houses, schools, universities and hospitals for the nation of international standards and at most economical prices.â

A spokesman for NAB said that four firms involved in the project were ready to return some amount under voluntary return (VR) deals. âThere must be something wrong. That is why the contractors are ready to return the money to the government exchequer,â he added.

He said that a reference had been prepared against officials of the Multan Development Authority for âillegalâ acquisition of state land for the project.

The NAB spokesman said that the inquiry into the MMBP covered four main dimensions â evaluation of feasibility study and approval of the project; evaluation of bidding process, award of the contract, execution of works, international procurements, payments made to contractors, sub-contractors and vendors; evaluation of land acquisition process; and tracking/trailing of financial transactions into accounts of M/s Yabaite China.

He said that NAB Multan was conducting investigations as per laws and it would send its report to the bureauâs headquarters for scrutiny and review. The report will be presented before the executive board of NAB to decide further course of action.

The main opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is also planning a strong protest on the floor of the assembly, if the speaker does not issue the production order for former railways minister Khwaja Saad Rafique, who has been in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) along with his brother Salman Rafique in connection with an inquiry into a housing society scam.

Sources in the National Assembly Secretariat told Dawn that the speaker had already issued the production order for Leader of the Opposition Shahbaz Sharif while the process of the issuance of the production order for Mr Rafique was under way.

Seventh session of National Assembly begins today

Mr Sharif has been attending the NA sessions and meetings of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on the speakerâs production orders since his arrest by NAB on Oct 6 last year in the Ashiyana housing scam.

Mr Rafique had been arrested by NAB on Dec 11 last year at a time when the assembly was already in session. The opposition parties had lodged a strong protest and even boycotted most of the sittings before the speaker issued production order only a day before prorogation of the house on Dec 21.

The speaker has already summoned a meeting of the House Business Advisory Committee comprising representatives of all the parties present in the assembly before start of the session in which he is expected to take up the issue of the formation of the committees, besides discussing the agenda for the upcoming session which is expected to continue for more than two weeks as the government intends to present a mini-budget on Jan 23.

Finance Minister Asad Umar, while speaking to the members of the business community during his visit to the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Saturday, had announced that the government would present a mini-budget on Jan 23 and dispelled the impression that it would be loaded with new taxes.

Mr Umar had admitted that last year had been difficult not only for the government but also for the business community as during the five months (July-November) of the current financial year, only $818 million came under Foreign Direct Investment against $1.35 billion in the same period last financial year.

The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the PML-N are questioning the governmentâs move to present second mini-budget in less than six months.

Strongly opposing the plan, PPPâs vice president Senator Sherry Rehman had asked if the government, which was determined to bring about a revolution, would introduce mini-budgets every four months. She alleged that the mini-budget was being unveiled to meet the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund.

She regretted that just a day after an increase in the prices of drugs, the government announced its plans about unveiling a mini-budget.

Similarly, the PML-N leaders, including former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, had also questioned the governmentâs move to present another mini-budget. Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, the PML-N leaders had lashed out at the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government for its âdirectionless and failedâ economic policies, which had drastically brought down the countryâs growth rate in just five months.

House committees

Despite succeeding in breaking the deadlock between the government and the opposition over the issue of the PAC chairmanship last month, Speaker Asad Qaiser is still struggling to complete the process of the formation of house committees.

The delay in the formation of over three dozen committees has badly affected the legislative work of parliament, and the National Assembly which came into existence in August after the general elections held in July is functioning with only two committees, including the PAC.

Sources said that an understanding between the government and the opposition had already been reached on the distribution of the chairmanship of 38 standing committees. Under the agreed formula, the chairmanship of 18 committees would go to the opposition while the remaining 20 committees would be headed by the PTI and its allies.

However, they said, the two sides were yet to discuss the committees to be distributed among the treasury and the opposition members. The opposition parties, the sources said, wanted to head the important committees like interior, foreign affairs, power and finance.

The speaker had met Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan and the opposition leaders in the last two days and after his meeting with the government and the opposition representatives, he expressed the hope that he would constitute the committees during the session.

Meanwhile, the NA Secretariat on Sunday issued a nine-point agenda for the Mondayâs sitting which includes presentation of a report by the government on âI-Voting Pilot test in 35 constituencies held on October 14 last year, as required under Section 94 of the Elections Act, 2017â.

148,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457450/minister-terms-all-previous-budgets-fake,"Minister terms all previous budgets fake
",1/14/2019,"LAHORE: Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Sunday said that all previous budgets were fake and now real budgets were being presented.

âThe upcoming January 23 mini-budget will lay a foundation of Pakistanâs strong economy,â he said and added that the PTI government would come up to the expectations of people.

The information ministerâs remarks come a day after Finance Minister Asad Umar on Saturday dispelled the impression that the upcoming mini-budget would be loaded with new taxes. While addressing members of the business community in Karachi, Mr Umar had said that the mini-budget would focus on ease of doing business and measures to facilitate trade and industrialisation.

Says governance will improve in two to three years

The information minister urged people to have trust in the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, adding that governance would improve in two to three years.

âHave patience for two to three years and this governmentâs governance will be of par excellence,â he told the media at ThinkFest at Alhamra Arts Council.

Mr Chaudhry said PM Khan did not believe in giving relief (NRO) to any corrupt.

âOne has already landed in jail, while the other will follow suit,â he said while referring to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and ex-president Asif Ali Zardari, respectively.

He reiterated that Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari were pressurising (the government) in and out of parliament but they would not get any NRO.

The information minister said that Mr Sharifâs and Mr Zardariâs parties had collapsed.

âThey have dug their political graves with their style of politics. We didnât contribute anything [to their troubles],â Mr Chaudhry said.

The minister expressed wonder over the way the trial of Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif was being conducted, saying they were enjoying all freedom when compared with incarceration of Wali Khan, Faiz Ahmad Faiz and other high-profile people who remained in prison. âNawaz Sharif flew to London during his trial and his lawyers cross-examined witnesses for 22 days.â

He said that Opposition Leader in National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif was in jail only on papers as he was living in his house and holding meetings and sometimes even called the NAB and prosecutors to appear before him. âI havenât seen such a trial in my life,â he said and added, âstill they are heading towards their political deathâ.

Responding to a question about former US Ambassador Cameron Munter that Pakistan had misused funds given by the US to counter terrorism as well as promote education, Mr Chaudhry brushed aside Mr Munterâs statement, saying he had retired long ago and did not know anything happening now.

He pointed out that the US had already discontinued the Coalition Support Fund. However, he added, Pakistan-US relations were now improving. He said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had visited Pakistan and later Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi met him in Washington leading to improvement in Pak-US ties.

âI guess Munter has not visited Washington for quite some time,â he said.

Referring to the PPP leadersâ names on the ECL, he said the direction was given by the JIT and the government had just implemented it.

Regarding his re-scheduled visit to Sindh and PPP minister Saeed Ghaniâs assertion that he could stop him entering Sindh, Mr Chaudhry said Sindh was part of Pakistan and no one could stop him from going there. He said he was going to Sindh in connection with the affairs of his ministry and would obviously meet his colleagues there.

Mr Chaudhry said the information ministry would come up with a calendar of mega events in the country in a couple of weeks to allow space to thinkers and writers to speak up their minds.

Emphasising the need for promotion of tourism, he said Pakistan had decided to allow visa-free entry to people from 66 countries.

âPeople from across the globe will be invited to participate in various literary, cultural, social and religious festivals,â the minister said and added that the government was working on mechanisms to keep the events safe.

He said authors would be encouraged and film industry would be revived.

âPM Imran Khanâs vision is not just political but also social, and he wants to generate activity that will bring people closer unlike past rulers, who only worked to fill their coffers,â Mr Chaudhry said.

",1/14/2019,"UN experts on Sunday urged Pakistan not to carry out the âarbitrary executionâ of a former police officer who suffers from mental illness.

The execution of Khizar Hayat, sentenced to death in 2003 for killing a colleague, was suspended by the Supreme Court on Saturday, his legal team said, just three days before the 55-year-old was due to be hanged.

The top court will on Monday hold a hearing into whether the execution can go ahead, according to a press release from Justice Project Pakistan, an NGO handling Hayat's case.

The group welcomed the âtimely intervention by the highest seat of justice in the land to prevent a wrongful execution,â and also gave Khayat's age as 60.

âThe imposition of capital punishment on individuals with psychosocial disabilities is a clear violation of Pakistan's international obligations,â said Agnes Callamard, UN expert on extrajudicial executions and Catalina Devandas, the special rapporteur on disabled rights.

Hayat, who has spent more than 15 years in custody, has been kept in solitary confinement since 2012, the UN experts said, urging the government to halt the execution and questioning the veracity of his conviction.

âDuring his trial, no evidence or witnesses were called in his defence and no questions were asked regarding his mental health, although he was later diagnosed with a mental health condition and has been receiving treatment for the past 10 years,â they said.

âImplementing the death penalty under these conditions is unlawful and tantamount to an arbitrary execution, as well as a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment,â the UN panel said.

Two years ago, experts from the World Psychiatric Association also appealed to Pakistan to halt his execution, saying he was suffering from schizophrenia and did not understand the crime he had committed.

""I will offer free legal assistance to the oppressed, poor and helpless people at my free legal clinic,"" he said, stressing that the country belongs to the disadvantaged populace as much as it does to those from the more privileged sections of society.

",1/13/2019,"Former United States ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter on Sunday said President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Imran Khan ""may find some sort of common ground"" if and when a meeting is held between the two leaders.

Addressing an event organised by the Karachi Council on Foreign Relations, the former envoy said Trump and Khan are in power because they both have ""very good political sense"".

""They have the fingertip feeling, as we say, they're very clever with people,"" he said while speaking at the event, 'Brunch & Conversation with Ambassador Cameron Munter', held at Karachi's Movenpick Hotel.

Munter said there was a possibility that if the two leaders meet, they might find some common ground that could help improve their bilateral relationship.""Not the kind that typical analytical diplomats find, but they may find that there is common ground in some way,"" he added.

On January 2, President Trump had expressed his desire to meet Prime Minister Khan for talks on US-led efforts to jump-start the Afghan peace process. âI look forward to meeting the folks from the new leadership in PakisÂ­tan [and] we will be doing that in not-too-distant future,â he had said.

Following this, the Foreign Office had welcomed Trumpâs remarks on ties with Pakistan and said the government was keenly waiting for the engagement at the highest level.

âWe look forward to positive engagement with the US at the leadership level,â FO spokesman Dr Mohammad Faisal had said during a weekly media briefing.

During the event today, Munter expressed a desire for better relations between Washington and Islamabad, DawnNewsTV reported.

The former US envoy said that at a tactical level there was still a sense that the kind of ties the United States has with the Pakistani military are ""valuable and important, if for no other reason then that there is still a residual [American] force in Afghanistan"".

He said it was the ""competence"" of the Pakistan Army that made them a ""good partner"" for Washington, and cited the example of the 2010 floods in Pakistan. During the catastrophic floods, he said he had opted not to call the PPP government to help the affected people, and instead approached the Pakistani military.",Dawn.com | Qazi Hassan,Dawn,Current Affairs,"Donald Trump, Imran Khan, meeting, Cameron Munter",1,"['former', 'united', 'states', 'ambassador', 'pakistan', 'cameron', 'munter', 'sunday', 'said', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'may', 'find', 'sort', 'common', 'ground', 'meeting', 'held', 'two', 'leaders', 'addressing', 'event', 'organised', 'karachi', 'council', 'foreign', 'relations', 'former', 'envoy', 'said', 'trump', 'khan', 'power', 'good', 'political', 'sense', 'fingertip', 'feeling', 'say', 'clever', 'people', 'said', 'speaking', 'event', 'brunch', 'conversation', 'ambassador', 'cameron', 'munter', 'held', 'karachi', 'movenpick', 'hotel', 'munter', 'said', 'possibility', 'two', 'leaders', 'meet', 'might', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'could', 'help', 'improve', 'bilateral', 'relationship', 'kind', 'typical', 'analytical', 'diplomats', 'find', 'may', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'way', 'added', 'january', '2', 'president', 'trump', 'expressed', 'desire', 'meet', 'prime', 'minister', 'khan', 'talks', 'usled', 'efforts', 'jumpstart', 'afghan', 'peace', 'process', 'ai', 'look', 'forward', 'meeting', 'folks', 'new', 'leadership', 'pakisatan', 'nottoodistant', 'future', 'said', 'following', 'foreign', 'office', 'welcomed', 'trumpas', 'remarks', 'ties', 'pakistan', 'said', 'government', 'keenly', 'waiting', 'engagement', 'highest', 'level', 'awe', 'look', 'forward', 'positive', 'engagement', 'us', 'leadership', 'level', 'fo', 'spokesman', 'dr', 'mohammad', 'faisal', 'said', 'weekly', 'media', 'briefing', 'event', 'today', 'munter', 'expressed', 'desire', 'better', 'relations', 'washington', 'islamabad', 'dawnnewstv', 'reported', 'former', 'us', 'envoy', 'said', 'tactical', 'level', 'still', 'sense', 'kind', 'ties', 'united', 'states', 'pakistani', 'military', 'valuable', 'important', 'reason', 'still', 'residual', 'american', 'force', 'afghanistan', 'said', 'competence', 'pakistan', 'army', 'made', 'good', 'partner', 'washington', 'cited', 'example', '2010', 'floods', 'pakistan', 'catastrophic', 'floods', 'said', 'opted', 'call', 'ppp', 'government', 'help', 'affected', 'people', 'instead', 'approached', 'pakistani', 'military']"
153,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457278/mohmand-dam-inauguration-ceremony-postponed-again,"Mohmand Dam inauguration ceremony postponed again
",1/13/2019,"The much-awaited inauguration ceremony of the Mohmand Dam scheduled for Sunday was postponed for at least the second time this month, government officials said.

The ceremony for the dam was to be held on January 2 but was rescheduled until today due to a controversy that emerged following the award of the contract of the hydropower project.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Minister Shaukat Yousafzai confirmed to DawnNewsTV that the ceremony today had been postponed.

Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Media Iftikhar Durrani said a new date would be announced after consultation with Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who would attend the inauguration ceremony.

Durrani ruled out the impression that the project's inauguration had been delayed due to any controversies. He said the tender for the project was awarded in the PML-N government's tenure and the incumbent government had no role in the matter.

Chief Justice Nisar had last week taken offence over not being informed about the rescheduling of the ceremony and had said he may not attend.

Justice Nisar has paid close attention to the issue of water scarcity and had ordered the creation of the Dam Fund in July last year â a fund that appeals to the general public and overseas Pakistanis for donations for the construction of the Mohmand Dam and the Diamer-Bhasha Dam.

The top judge's initiative was later joined by the prime minister. Within a span of five months, a total of Rs8.46bn was deposited in The Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of Pakistan Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand Dams Fund, according to State Bank of Pakistan data in December 2018.

Justice Nisar and Prime Minister Imran Khan were to be the chief guests of today's event.

Mohmand Dam contract controversy

The dam contract was awarded on a single-bid basis to a consortium of three companies led by Descon, a company previously owned by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, in which he and his family members currently hold ownership stakes.

A second contestant for the bid, a consortium comprising the Frontier Works Organisation, Andritz Hydro and Power China was technically disqualified and its financial bid was not considered, some top-ranking national contractors cited by Dawn said earlier.

The award of the bid to the Descon-led consortium raised questions about a possible conflict of interest and the process of the award.

Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda claimed the controversy around the award of the dam's contract has been created ""on the agenda of international powers"".

He said that Dawood had already resigned from the company before the bidding was held on July 18 â before the new government came to power. He added that the PM's adviser had nothing to do with the contract and had no way to influence the bidding process.

Descon only holds 30pc of shares in the consortium and the bids were evaluated by technical experts comprising Nespak, an Australian company, and another foreign firm, according to Vawda.

Wapda Chairman Hussain said that it was coincidental that the single bidder's price was also almost the same as estimated by the government and insisted there was no conflict of interest in the award of the contract to a company having links with a sitting cabinet member.

Although Hussain agreed that Descon was linked to Dawood, he maintained it had nothing to do with the bidding conducted by Wapda and dismissed the notion that he or the body was facing pressure over the groundbreaking of the project.

Abdul Razak Dawood in a statement also explained that he had founded and headed Descon like several other business ventures, but had disclosed all his business associations in writing to the prime minister and resigned from these positions before joining the government to ensure transparency and avoid conflict of interest.

The Mohmand Dam project

The construction of the Rs309 billion Mohmand dam â which will be situated on the Swat river in the Manda area â is said to be imperative to resolve the problems of water scarcity and electricity shortfall in the country.

A sum of Rs2bn has been allocated for the project in the Public Sector Development Programme 2018-19.

Work on the dam will begin this month and is expected to be complete within five years. It will have the capacity to store 0.676 MAF of water and generate 800 megawatts of electricity. It will also irrigate 16,000 acres of land and increase agricultural production in the area.

The completion of the project will require 8,668 acres of land mostly in Mohmand tribal district and some parts of Bajaur and Malakand.",Dawn.com | Sirajuddin,Dawn,Current Affairs,"Mohmand Dam, inaugration delay, Imran Khan, Saqib Nisar",0,"['muchawaited', 'inauguration', 'ceremony', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'scheduled', 'sunday', 'postponed', 'least', 'second', 'time', 'month', 'government', 'officials', 'said', 'ceremony', 'dam', 'held', 'january', '2', 'rescheduled', 'today', 'due', 'controversy', 'emerged', 'following', 'award', 'contract', 'hydropower', 'project', 'khyber', 'pakhtunkhwa', 'information', 'minister', 'shaukat', 'yousafzai', 'confirmed', 'dawnnewstv', 'ceremony', 'today', 'postponed', 'special', 'assistant', 'prime', 'minister', 'media', 'iftikhar', 'durrani', 'said', 'new', 'date', 'would', 'announced', 'consultation', 'chief', 'justice', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'would', 'attend', 'inauguration', 'ceremony', 'durrani', 'ruled', 'impression', 'project', 'inauguration', 'delayed', 'due', 'controversies', 'said', 'tender', 'project', 'awarded', 'pmln', 'government', 'tenure', 'incumbent', 'government', 'role', 'matter', 'chief', 'justice', 'nisar', 'last', 'week', 'taken', 'offence', 'informed', 'rescheduling', 'ceremony', 'said', 'may', 'attend', 'justice', 'nisar', 'paid', 'close', 'attention', 'issue', 'water', 'scarcity', 'ordered', 'creation', 'dam', 'fund', 'july', 'last', 'year', 'fund', 'appeals', 'general', 'public', 'overseas', 'pakistanis', 'donations', 'construction', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'diamerbhasha', 'dam', 'top', 'judge', 'initiative', 'later', 'joined', 'prime', 'minister', 'within', 'span', 'five', 'months', 'total', 'rs846bn', 'deposited', 'supreme', 'court', 'pakistan', 'prime', 'minister', 'pakistan', 'diamerbhasha', 'mohmand', 'dams', 'fund', 'according', 'state', 'bank', 'pakistan', 'data', 'december', '2018', 'justice', 'nisar', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'chief', 'guests', 'today', 'event', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'contract', 'controversy', 'dam', 'contract', 'awarded', 'singlebid', 'basis', 'consortium', 'three', 'companies', 'led', 'descon', 'company', 'previously', 'owned', 'adviser', 'prime', 'minister', 'commerce', 'abdul', 'razak', 'dawood', 'family', 'members', 'currently', 'hold', 'ownership', 'stakes', 'second', 'contestant', 'bid', 'consortium', 'comprising', 'frontier', 'works', 'organisation', 'andritz', 'hydro', 'power', 'china', 'technically', 'disqualified', 'financial', 'bid', 'considered', 'topranking', 'national', 'contractors', 'cited', 'dawn', 'said', 'earlier', 'award', 'bid', 'desconled', 'consortium', 'raised', 'questions', 'possible', 'conflict', 'interest', 'process', 'award', 'federal', 'minister', 'water', 'resources', 'faisal', 'vawda', 'claimed', 'controversy', 'around', 'award', 'dam', 'contract', 'created', 'agenda', 'international', 'powers', 'said', 'dawood', 'already', 'resigned', 'company', 'bidding', 'held', 'july', '18', 'new', 'government', 'came', 'power', 'added', 'pm', 'adviser', 'nothing', 'contract', 'way', 'influence', 'bidding', 'process', 'descon', 'holds', '30pc', 'shares', 'consortium', 'bids', 'evaluated', 'technical', 'experts', 'comprising', 'nespak', 'australian', 'company', 'another', 'foreign', 'firm', 'according', 'vawda', 'wapda', 'chairman', 'hussain', 'said', 'coincidental', 'single', 'bidder', 'price', 'also', 'almost', 'estimated', 'government', 'insisted', 'conflict', 'interest', 'award', 'contract', 'company', 'links', 'sitting', 'cabinet', 'member', 'although', 'hussain', 'agreed', 'descon', 'linked', 'dawood', 'maintained', 'nothing', 'bidding', 'conducted', 'wapda', 'dismissed', 'notion', 'body', 'facing', 'pressure', 'groundbreaking', 'project', 'abdul', 'razak', 'dawood', 'statement', 'also', 'explained', 'founded', 'headed', 'descon', 'like', 'several', 'business', 'ventures', 'disclosed', 'business', 'associations', 'writing', 'prime', 'minister', 'resigned', 'positions', 'joining', 'government', 'ensure', 'transparency', 'avoid', 'conflict', 'interest', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'project', 'construction', 'rs309', 'billion', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'situated', 'swat', 'river', 'manda', 'area', 'said', 'imperative', 'resolve', 'problems', 'water', 'scarcity', 'electricity', 'shortfall', 'country', 'sum', 'rs2bn', 'allocated', 'project', 'public', 'sector', 'development', 'programme', '201819', 'work', 'dam', 'begin', 'month', 'expected', 'complete', 'within', 'five', 'years', 'capacity', 'store', '0676', 'maf', 'water', 'generate', '800', 'megawatts', 'electricity', 'also', 'irrigate', '16000', 'acres', 'land', 'increase', 'agricultural', 'production', 'area', 'completion', 'project', 'require', '8668', 'acres', 'land', 'mostly', 'mohmand', 'tribal', 'district', 'parts', 'bajaur', 'malakand']"
154,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457276/how-the-newly-established-panah-gahs-in-islamabad-are-helping-labourers,"How the newly established Panah Gahs in Islamabad are helping labourers
",1/13/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Munir Ahmed, 52, has been living in Rawalpindi, where he works as a hawker at the Pirwadhai Bus Stand, for years.

Originally from Peshawar, Mr Ahmed said he earns around Rs1,000 a day, calling out to passengers and trying to persuade them to get the bus to Peshawar. Sometimes he doesnât get any work at all, because of the lack of buses, transportersâ strikes or a protest in the city.

âI used to spend Rs200 a day on food, and at night I would get a charpoy at the bus stand for Rs60. But since the Panah Gah opened in I-11 last month, I first try to get a charpoy there, because itâs provided for free, and failing that I go to the bus stand,â he told Dawn.

Whether or not he gets a charpoy, Mr Ahmed has breakfast, lunch and dinner at the new shelter - altogether, he is able to save around Rs300 every day, and send more money back to his family every month.

Two shelters â one at the I-11 Sabzi Mandi and one in Tarlai â have been opened by the district administration under orders from the prime minister.

Both the shelters were set up in 20 days; the one in Tarlai can house around 150 men and 50 women, while the one in Sabzi Mandi can house 150 men and women.

There are a number of homeless shelters that have opened across the country, but most are run in tents. Islamabad is the only city with fully functional shelters in buildings, with staff deputed there as well.

But Mr Ahmed said the capacity at the shelter is insufficient. âThe capacity for charpoys should be increased by tens of times. There are thousands of people who cannot even afford charpoys available for just Rs60 a night,â he said.

Jehangira-native Umer Daraz, 65, has a handcart on which he carries peopleâs goods.

âI have been working as a labourer despite becoming a senior citizen,â he told Dawn. âIt is good that the Panah Gah has been established, but I suggest the government also introduce some honorarium for the elderly.â

Mohammad Kamran, 35, has also been staying at the shelter. Mr Kamran is from Abbotabad and works as a labourer; the free meals and accommodation at the shelter mean that he is able to save some money.

Ghulam Naseem Khan, 56, who belongs to a village near Mianwali, has been staying at the shelter as well. Mr Khan said he was forcefully retired from the army in 1993 because a gun was recovered from his possession.

The following inquiry proved he had a licence for the pistol, based on which it was decided that he would receive two-thirds of his pension.

âI have been running from pillar to post since then, but no one has listened to my problem,â he said. âI am staying in Rawalpindi so that one day I might get someone in [General Headquarters] who would listen to my problem.â In the meantime, Mr Khan is working as a labourer.

The caretaker of the I-11 shelter, Rosh Dil Khan Hoti, said the shelter building was owned by Haji Allah Rakha - also known as Mukhtar Shah - who would distribute free meals in a street in I-10 in the early 1980s.

âSome of the residents complained to the district administration that the street would be blocked because of the distribution of food, so the district administration stopped him.

âLater the assistant commissioner, Chaudhry Mohammad Ali, forwarded a request to President Ziaul Haq to allocate land for the free distribution of food, and in 1986 a two and a half kanal plot was allocated for the Langar Khana in I-11. They used to give free curry and charge for naan; initially it was just a few paisas, and by last year it was Rs5 per naan,â Mr Hoti said.

âWhen Prime Minister Imran Khan directed to establish Panah Gahs, we held a camp at the fruit market giving away free food.

âThe Langar Khana contacted us and asked her to move the Panah Gah there. We involved philanthropists and not only contracted the building but a number of other facilities, such as a dispensary, food and residence have also been provided there,â he said.

Chief Commissioner Amer Ali Ahmed visited the site every day and pushed the staff, because of which the two-storey building was finished in 20 days and other facilities, such as televisions and so on, were also provided, he added.

âWe provide residence on a first-come-first-serve basis daily, and all the particulars and every personâs details are not only registered but also shared with the police. We cook here, a tandoor has also been established here, and we pay all the staff,â he said.

In response to a question, Mr Hoti said commodities such as flour and pulses are preferred to cash donations.

A senior district administration official, who asked not to be named, also told Dawn it has been decided to increase the number of charpoys to 400 and arrange food for 1,000 people.

He added that the dining hall will be moved to the basement, and another floor will be added to provide accommodation to up to 1,000 people in a few weeks.

155,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457274/editorial-why-india-should-revive-saarc,"Editorial: Why India should revive Saarc
",1/13/2019,"Revive Saarc: the message is clear, sensible and ought to be heeded.

The foreign minister of Nepal, Pradip Gyawali, has called on India to revive the Saarc heads of state summit, the last round of which was to be hosted by Pakistan in 2016 but was cancelled after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to travel to Pakistan and New Delhi leaned on other Saarc members to boycott the summit.

Meanwhile, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai has also added his voice to calls for the revival of Saarc and has spoken of the need for India and Pakistan to work together to reactivate the moribund organisation.

Mr Gyawali and Mr Karzai are right: Saarc needs to be revived and the multilateral forum should not be held hostage to bilateral tensions.

Indeed, Saarc could be a platform to address the very problems that India has wanted addressed by Pakistan, and Pakistan wants India to address.

It is striking that the smaller countries in Saarc are now openly recognising what has long been apparent: it is the countries of the region collectively that lose when dialogue and cooperation is suspended.

With a general election in India scheduled for later this year, there is a small window of opportunity before the Indian government goes into election mode and policy decisions are suspended.

There is no indication that Mr Modi and his government are seeking to reassess their approach to Pakistan ahead of a general election that could be closer than was expected until relatively recently.

But in seeking a second consecutive general election victory, Mr Modi and his team ought to recognise that the cycles of domestic politics and international relations are different and ought to be addressed separately.

Prime Minister Imran Khan and the military leadership in Pakistan have continued to express a desire for dialogue with India on mutually acceptable terms.

A generational shift may be imminent in Afghanistan and Pakistan and India could have pragmatic talks with Afghanistan on helping craft a stable and peaceful region.

Indiaâs Kashmir policy has been disastrous and dialogue remains the only sensible path ahead.

",1/13/2019,"In a session on âMuslim Women, Laws and Sexualitiesâ, researcher Afia Zia and Fauzia Viqar spoke about the family laws and Muslim women with respect to socio-political order, secularism and feminism.

Viqar spoke about the challenges and obstacles that women in Pakistan faced within the law and in society.

Fauzia Viqar said there were three or four basic laws that guarantee women their rights in a family system, including the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (MFLO) formed in 1961, Dissolution of Marriage Act, the Child Custody Law and the Child Marriage Restraint Act, with amendments in 2017.

She said while these laws had made certain improvements there was a lot more left to do. She said the MFLO for the first time gave the right to divorce, the right to apply for khula (permission for divorce), and the right to refuse her husband another marriage.

She said it must be noted that the Christians, the Hindus and the Sikhs had their own marriage and divorce laws, although they too needed a lot of work on these to protect the womenâs rights.

âWe still see many problems arising from lack of implementation and the mindset starting from the judges down to the process servers,â she said.

She said the worst part was the discrimination between the ages of boys and girls in the Child Marriage Restraint Act where girlsâ age is given as 16 years and boysâ age as 18 years.

âWhenever we speak about changing this, there seems to be an uproar as if we are going against the basic tenets of religion,â she said. âThe same is the case with right to refuse polygamy. No one wants to accept this.â

Also read: A comprehensive list of things you can 'lightly beat' other than your wife

Ms Viqar also spoke of protection of women post divorce, and said that women must be given financial support after divorce. Womenâs right in marital property should be divided equally too.

Meanwhile, Afia Zia, a feminist, researcher and author of âFaith and Feminismâ spoke about the women in Pakistan and how they had changed under every regime. She addressed the post-9/11 situation with regard to women movements in the Muslim context.

She said Gen Zia had politicised womenâs sexuality and painted the image of immoral women as those who were open about themselves.

âZina became an easy tool to control women with, and was used by the state, by society and by families and parents,â she said. âFour decades later women are still easy targets and are being used to further establish patriarchy in different ways.â

Also read: Like every other year, 2018 was the year of male rage

Speaking about womenâs movements, Ms Zia said a prevailing notion was that there had been no rural movements, but she counted out the lady health workersâ movement that managed to regularise their positions, as well as raise their salaries across Pakistan, the Sindhyani tehreek (beginning from rural Sindh) and the women councillorsâ and the hari movements.

âThere is a difference of political positioning between women activists and feminists,â she added. âFeminists take on issues that impact more than just women. They speak of human rights essentially.â

In her book, Afiya Zia says that the Muslim womenâs secular autonomy promises major transformation and effectively challenges Muslim male dominance.

In a session âFog from London to Lahoreâ, Dr Christina Corton and Ahmed Rafay Alam spoke about the fog (now smog) that infected London back in the Victorian era while today Lahore was also suffering similarly.

In an interesting presentation, Dr Corton showed pictures, cartoons, and paintings by people who depicted the infamous London fog, sometimes even known as the London particular.

Rafay said Lahore was suffering the same way and only Saturdayâs air quality readings were 163 (AQ) and PM 2.5, which was double the limit. He said people must speak out against it.

",1/13/2019,"Illustration by Abro

The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), once the most dominant political party in Karachi, is in complete disarray. At the moment there are three factions of the party vying for the Mohajir vote and at least two sub-factions within one of the splinter groups.

The immediate memory associated with the MQM in the minds of the partyâs supporters is that of an organisation that was able to stall the political and economic alienation of Sindhâs Mohajirs. The other immediate memory of the party â mostly held by its detractors â is of an outfit which plunged Sindhâs capital, Karachi, into ethnic turmoil and of heinous crimes allegedly committed by the partyâs armed wings.

There are also those who have maintained that the party was the outcome of âpolitical engineeringâ undertaken by the âagenciesâ at the behest of Gen Ziaâs dictatorship (1977-88). This has often been repeated by various political analysts. Even though this claim has never been convincingly substantiated, it is possible that this indeed was the case before the party broke away from the agenciesâ orbit sometime in the late 1980s.

Was the MQM simply engineered by Gen Zia or was there more to its history?

This perception is largely rooted in comments by some Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) leaders and then those belonging to the PPP. In 1986, when one of the worst ethnic riots in Karachi propelled the MQM into the forefront, the JI claimed that the party had been created by the Zia dictatorship to neutralise the support the JI once enjoyed in Karachi. The PPP, on the other hand, claimed that the party had been engineered to âbalance out the PPPâs influence in Sindh.â

There are various theories about MQMâs formation. But there is enough agreement among historians and analysts about the train of events which led to the formation of a Mohajir nationalist outfit. Dr Tanvir A. Tahirâs book Political Dynamics of Sindh traces the roots of this evolution all the way back to the 1950s when, according to Tahir, the Mohajir community began to feel it was being pushed out of the countryâs ruling and economic elite. Tahir writes that the Mohajirs had become part of this elite immediately after Pakistanâs creation in 1947 when the Punjabis dominated the military and the Mohajirs were prominent in the bureaucracy.

After the assassination of Pakistanâs first prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan (a Mohajir), the Mohajirs began to feel that they were being nudged out. According to Tahir, the Mohajirs â who had come in droves from various parts of India and had mainly settled in Sindh â did not find the need to become familiar with the Sindhi culture because they became a majority in Karachi. Tahir also writes that this delayed the formation of a Sindhi middle class because the Mohajirs immediately managed to bag important positions in the provinceâs economy and government from Karachi that had become the countryâs first capital.

In 1954, a Mohajir politician, Mahmud-ul-Haq Usmani demanded that Karachi be made a separate Mohajir-majority province. But the imposition of the One Unit system, that clubbed West Pakistan as a single province, somewhat placated the Mohajir community which was suspicious of provinces being based on ethnic considerations.

According to Tanvir, the Mohajirs found themselves almost completely ousted from the ruling circles during the Ayub Khan regime in the 1960s. They vehemently took part in the 1968 anti-Ayub movement. But when, after Ayubâs departure in 1969, Gen Yahya Khan agreed to do away with the One Unit, the Mohajir groups protested against Karachi becoming part of Sindh.

The February 23, 1969, edition of daily Dawn reported the formation of a Jeay Karachi Committee. It was mainly led by a faction of the left-wing National Students Federation (NSF-Kazmi). The Committee demanded the creation of a âKarachi sooba (province).â Another organisation, the Mohajir Mahaz (MM) came into being in late 1969. But MM could win just one Sindh provincial assembly seat during the 1970 election. Mohajir vote largely went to JI and Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Pakistan (JUP).

In 1972, when the PPP-led Sindh government declared Sindhi as the provinceâs official language, groups of Mohajir students formed the Muttahida Tulaba Mahaz Karachi (MTMK). They asked car owners to change their number plates to Urdu and also attacked English signboards. Riots broke out between the police and the MTMK in Karachi and between Mohajir and Sindhi youth elsewhere in Sindh.

Usmani, who had demanded Karachi to be made a separate province in 1954, had joined the left-wing National Awami Party (NAP). But he lost the election in 1970. During the 1972 riots, he formed the Urdu Qaumi Council. The July 15, 1972, edition of daily Jang quotes the Council members as saying that the organisation was launched to âinculcate in the minds of Mohajirs, scientific consciousness of their history and culture.â The Council also demanded that the state treat Mohajirs as a separate ethnic community as it does the Punjabis, Sindhis, Baloch and Pakhtuns. Two years later, in 1974, a Karachi Province Movement was launched but it fizzled out.

The Mohajirs of Karachi played a leading role in the 1977 movement against the Bhutto regime. In 1978, two Karachi University (KU) students, Altaf Hussain and Azeem Ahmad Tariq formed the All Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO). In his 2011 biography, My Lifeâs Journey, Hussain writes that Mohajir youth were exploited by JI and JUP against the Bhutto regime.

In 1981, APMSO became a member of the progressive student alliance, the United Students Movement (USM) at Karachi University (KU). Hussain writes that JIâs youth wing âexpelledâ APMSO from KU and the party began to establish offices in Mohajir mohallas (localities).

According to their 2011 essay for Berkeley Journal of Social Sciences, Ali Chandio, M. Ahmad and F. Naseem quote famous Sindhi scholar Ibrahim Joyo as saying that âPunjabi economic hegemonyâ increased immensely in Sindh during the dictatorship of Gen Zia. This situation had a negative impact on the interests of Karachiâs prominent (non-Punjabi) business communities. This concern saw some members of these communities form an organisation called the Maha Sindh (MS) in 1983.

It was an organisation set up to protect the economic interests of Karachiâs Memon, Sindhi and Mohajir businessmen and traders. Chandio, Ahmad and Naseem write that Maha Sindh encouraged the formation of a Karachi-based party. Many APMSO members were involved in the partyâs activities. MS eventually became a Mohajir-dominated organisation, which then evolved into becoming the MQM in 1984.

158,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457271/chinas-re-education-system-and-pakistans-silence,"China's 're-education' system and Pakistan's silence
",1/13/2019,"IN an interview with a Turkish television channel, Prime Minister Imran Khan completely sidestepped a question about the condition of Uighur Muslims in Chinaâs western Xinjiang province. He admitted that he knew little about the issue, and, instead, preferred to focus on and highlight Chinese financial assistance and investment in Pakistan.

China is under stiff criticism for its alleged persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, especially Uighur Muslims. Freedom Houseâs 2018 country report on China classified it as âreligiously-not-freeâ on its freedom index. China is seriously concerned about this growing perception that hurts its efforts to promote a âsoft imageâ of China for a successful execution of its Belt and Road Initiative and other global commercial and strategic projects. Last week, China said that it welcomed UN officials to visit Xinjiang provided that they stay out of its internal affairs.

Pakistan usually avoids commenting on Chinaâs internal affairs. But many Pakistani men, married to Chinese Uighur women, claim their spouses are being held in so-called re-education camps and are demanding their release. The issue has put Pakistan in a difficult position, mainly due to Chinaâs huge investment in the country, as well as the extreme sensitivity of Chinese authorities to discussions on the subject.

Mystery continues to shroud the nature of the camps in Xinjiang.

Mystery continues to shroud Chinaâs re-education camps, with authorities least interested in opening them up to independent observers. However, Chinese scholars claim that they are a part of the countryâs countering violent extremism strategy, which was not built in isolation from rest of the world. They assert that China has designed its re-education strategy after carefully examining CVE approaches in practice in the West and Muslim world, which also employ similar community engagement programmes. Though they tend to justify their muscular approach by quoting examples from the Gulf, and South and Southeast Asian Muslim nations, the Chinese CVE strategy still appears highly politicised and opaque to Western practitioners and policymakers.

Much of the information about Chinaâs re-education centres comes from West. Though the criticism has forced Chinese authorities to âreleaseâ some information, it is insufficient to make a proper assessment. Last year, a state-run news agency published an interview of Shohrat Zakir, the Xinjiang governor, describing the camps as âprofessional vocational training institutionsâ for people influenced by terrorism and extremism who have not committed an offence warranting criminal punishment.

Similarly, in a seminar in China last November, local scholars explained Chinaâs CVE approaches. Alluding to diverse and disparate CVE practices in different countries, they tended to conclude that no uniform or global CVE programme exists. One Chinese scholar presented a four-layered model based on the four principles of breaking, establishing, preventing and developing. âBreakingâ referred to isolating individuals from an extremist environment; âestablishingâ meant introducing them to the true spiritual values of religion; âpreventingâ was seen as educating; and âdevelopingâ was interpreted as a skill development programme.

However, one of the best works available on the subject of Chinaâs CVE strategy is by Zunyou Zhou, a Germany-based Chinese scholar. In a paper published in the Journal of Terrorism and Political Violence in 2017, he noted that the Chinese CVE strategy is based on multiple approaches and, interestingly, that they consulted Western CVE and deradicalisation approaches extensively and then built their own, more muscular model. The approaches include âfive keysâ, âfour prongsâ, âthree contingentsâ, âtwo handsâ and âone ruleâ. Viewed together, these approaches point to legal, religious, cultural, ideological, and scientific aspects of the deradicalisation effort, implemented by governmental agencies, public institutions and non-governmental organisations in the region.

The Xinjiang government has developed several programmes to target different groups of people, including those who are âradicalisedâ as well as those who are not but considered vulnerable to recruitment. The âfive keysâ â ideological, cultural, customary, religious and legal â give a long-sustaining solution to terrorism. The âfour prongsâ refer to a combination of four methods: âsqueezing by correct faithâ; âcounteracting by cultureâ; âcontrolling by lawâ; and âpopularising scienceâ. âSqueezing by correct faithâ refers to clarifying peopleâs understanding of Islam while âcounteracting by cultureâ means seeking effective and practical solutions to thwart extremism and guiding people towards secularisation and modernisation. The âthree contingentsâ refer to the policy of reinforcing three main groups of people the government can count on to maintain stability and security. The âtwo handsâ refer to the one âfirm handâ that cracks down on terrorists, and the other âfirm handâ that educates and guides Uighur people, and the âone ruleâ means the policy of ruling Xinjiang according to the law.

The author also provides historical background on the evolution of the Chinese CVE strategy and mentions that it materialised in a policy document entitled Several Guiding Opinions on Further Suppressing Illegal Religious Activities and Combating the Infiltration of Religious Extremism in Accordance with Law, issued by Xinjiangâs CCP Committee in May 2013. The policy document was also referred to as âNo. 11 Documentâ, and described the borders between ethnic customs, normal religious practices and extremist manifestations.

For the CVE strategyâs smooth implementation, the Xinjiang authorities have introduced new legal regimes, and the latest amendment (titled âRegulation on Anti-Extremismâ) was introduced in April 2017 to ban a wide range of extremist behaviours. Under the new legal framework, authorities have launched many programmes including deradicalisation for prisoners, and social programmes for those who have engaged in terrorism or extremism but do not deserve criminal punishment.

The re-education camps â or ârehabilitation centresâ â have been created as a part of Chinaâs social programming. These centres run through civil society groups in Xinjiang or through âFang Hui Juâ working groups, dispatched by the regional government, comprising practitioners tasked with winning the hearts and minds of the people.

For CVE practitioners, the Chinese model may have a lot of substance to learn from. But the Uighur problem is more complex than religious extremism, as it has added dimensions of ethnic, cultural and political rights. For Pakistan, the Chinese CVE model offers nothing to learn from except to find a way of resolving the issue of Pakistani citizensâ spouses held in these camps.

159,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457201/the-emperors-new-clothes,"The emperorâs new clothes
",1/13/2019,"THE emperor walked beneath the beautiful canopy in the procession, and all the people in the street and in their windows said, âGoodness, the emperorâs new clothes are incomparable! What a beautiful train on his jacket. What a perfect fit!â No one wanted it to be noticed that he could see nothing, for then it would be said that he was unfit for his position or that he was stupid. None of the emperorâs clothes had ever before received such praise.

âBut he doesnât have anything on!â said a small child.

Pakistanâs most recent emperor problem is about to exit. The tales are many but they shall have to wait until after retirement â and perhaps never be told. After all, when one emperor exits, another tends to quickly appear. The system abhors a vacuum of would-be saviours.

Theyâve all stood silent as the emperor passed by them with his new clothes on.

Who knows the rabbits the next one will have us chasing after.

But as we bid farewell to one and prepare for the arrival of the next, letâs turn to the starring role in the Hans Christian Andersen tale: the child who cried, âBut he doesnât have anything on!â

Where is the Pakistani version of that child?

Someone to say, no, this is wrong, you canât do that. Stick to your job, stop interfering, stop pretending you know better, stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Stop trying to invent reality!

Or even a mild version of that.

Where is the person within the system willing to say no?

It canât be that hard; it isnât that hard. Especially within the court. An odious character showed the way recently, but for the wrong reasons and in a terrible way. But what happened to him? Stripped of his high-court judgeship, heâs been sent home.

Thatâs it. He lost his job and maybe his pension and probably a shot at one of those post-retirement sinecures that abound. For some thatâs a lot to sacrifice and maybe even too much. But not for everyone.

And yet theyâve all stood silent as the emperor passed by them with his new clothes on.

It is possible that the more damage was caused by Iftikhar Chaudhry. He didnât just think he was the messiah, he had proved that he was â who else can claim to have slain a dictator through mere defiance in a robe.

The worst thing about Chaudhry was that he was aware of what he had achieved and had an appreciation for the system â and his potentially limitless role within it. Chaudhry may have been mocked for trying to fix the price of sugar and excoriated for wading into the Steel Mills sale, but it was his eye for institutional and constitutional re-jigging that was truly dangerous.

Had it not been for the unavoidable judicial retirement age locked into the Constitution â who knows where weâd be today.

In contrast, the current occupant can seem tame. Flitting here and there, disrupting private and state business, it hasnât really amounted to much. No prime ministers ousted â though maybe that was already done â no shockwaves through the system, nothing that canât be patiently reversed.

But he could yet end up being worse because of something else: a willingness to break out of the judicial straitjacket and head for the orchestra pit itself, conducting an incoherent symphony.

Chaudhry is more famous, a trailblazer, as it were, but the incumbent has raised the populist bar. In theory, itâs easy enough for the successor to walk back: just donât do what the predecessor has done.

But it may not be that easy.

First, you need a willingness to do so â to walk back some of the excesses and make the institution less of a lightning rod. But before the incumbent became the best known judge in the land, there was another.

To be overshadowed is a worrying place to start from.

Second, the judge headed for the exit has already taken the hit for being unconventional. The folksy, always-in-the-headlines, being-the-centre-of-everything model is already here and the public has been primed to accept and enjoy it.

Third, it is real power and leverage. Whimsical, arbitrary and fierce may be hard to make institutional sense of, but when youâre pounding the gavel and working the headlines, you are creating significant space for yourself within the system. Folk ignore your orders and ignore you at their peril.

All of which to say, more than ever we may need that child to cry, âBut he doesnât have anything on!â

It is depressing to think that there is no such man, woman or child here.

So maybe all we can do is remember how the Hans Christen Andersen fable The Emperorâs New Clothes ends:

âGood Lord, let us hear the voice of an innocent child!â said the father, and whispered to another what the child had said.

âA small child said that he doesnât have anything on!â

Finally everyone was saying, âHe doesnât have anything on!â

The emperor shuddered, for he knew that they were right, but he thought, âThe procession must go on!â He carried himself even more proudly, and the chamberlains walked along behind carrying the train that wasnât there.

The End.

The procession must go on. The emperor has no clothes. There is no child here in this luckless land of ours to tell us the truth.

They said that the NLC personnel questioned the distribution of passports on Thursday to which the FIA staff objected as the former was not authorised to interfere in the official work of immigration.

",1/13/2019,"PESHAWAR: An anti-terrorism court here on Saturday recorded the statement of Mohammad Iqbal during the trial of four of many people charged with lynching his son, Mashal Khan, in the Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, in 2017.

The accused, including Asad Katlang, Sabir Mayar, Arif Khan and Izharullah alias Johny, who were arrested after remaining at large for a long time, were indicted on Sept 11, 2018, for involvement in the killing of Mashal Khan.

The court, which has been conducting in-camera proceedings, fixed Jan 19 for the next hearing after summoning some other prosecution witnesses.

Mashalâs father, Mohammad Iqbal, is also a complainant in the case.

Barrister Amirullah Khan Chamkani, Shah Khattak and Fazal Khan represented Mohammad Iqbal in the case.

Mashal Khan, a 23-year-old student of the Department of Mass Communication at the AWKU, Mardan, was lynched by a mob over the blasphemy allegation on Apr 13, 2017.

On Feb 7, an anti-terrorism court had convicted 31 of the 57 accused in the lynching case, awarding death sentence to the prime accused, Imran Khan, life imprisonment to five of them and three-year imprisonment to 25 others.

He said 10 million new jobs would soon be created for the youth while 500,000 houses would be constructed for the poor as promised by the PTI government.

Addressing a press conference at Mangla near Jhelum, the minister said 2019 was going to be the year of an economic change in the country.

Prime Minister Imran Khan is poised to give no let-up or make a deal or compromise on recovering looted resources of the country. He said overseas Pakistanis were the backbone of Pakistanâs economy and they should send foreign exchange through legal channels instead of hawala or hundi.

The minister said accountability was the election slogan of the PTI and would continue. He said grabbed lands were being retrieved from the land mafia.

The minister said Mangla and Jhelum had centuries-old history and the people of Jhelum had always defeated mafias.

",1/13/2019,"ISLAMABAD: The management of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) has decided to constitute an independent committee to investigate incidents of deaths of patients.

The decision has been made after a number of incidents in which relatives beat up doctors following the death of their patient or doctors held strikes after clashes with relatives of patients.

âI get annoyed with such incidents. A number of times relatives of deceased patients held protests and beat up doctors. Moreover, the media highlighted the incidents and spoke only in favour of the patients.

âOn the other hand, a number of times doctors held protests and strikes after such incidents,â Pimsâ Executive Director (ED) Dr Raja Amjad told Dawn.

He said a few days ago a child was brought to the children hospital in a critical condition.

Though a doctor suggested conducting dialysis, the nephrology department doctors were of the view that dialysis could not be done on the child because he was very weak.

âIn the meantime, the child died and it became a big issue. Even a mediaperson reached the hospital and blamed the âirresponsibleâ behaviour of doctors for the death.â

In most of the cases, Dr Amjad said, patients were brought to the hospital at the last stage due to which it becomes almost impossible for doctors to save their life.

A few days ago a swine flu patient was admitted to a private hospital at H-8. Later, he was shifted to another private hospital at G-8 and when the private hospital doctors told his relatives that the patient cannot survive, he was shifted to Pims, he said.

âIt becomes impossible to treat such patients. However, after the death of the patient, his relatives started blaming the doctors of Pims.

âI assume that soon doctors would stop treating very serious patients because of fear that they would be blamed for the death,â Dr Amjad said.

Pims is a tertiary care hospital and every day eight to 10 patients die here. Though inquiry committees are established in all the units, âwe have also set up a âdeath review committeeâ but patients and their relatives never trust such committees.â

He said the management has now decided to establish the independent committee in which even representatives of the media and civil society would also be included.

âI would request relatives of patients to file complaints with the committee rather than protesting and beating doctors after the death of a patient,â Dr Amjad said.

",1/13/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio Chairman Dr Jean Marc OlivÃ© on Saturday urged the government to go extra mile to free Pakistan from the crippling disease.

Chairing the concluding session of TAG here, he said Pakistan was in a good position to stop polio in the very near future with the exceptional political commitment, strong coordination under the umbrella of Emergency Operations Centre and a strategy â the National Emergency Action Plan â which was delivering results.

âI urge everyone to continue the work they have been doing. Karachi and Peshawar are the primary areas of concern for the programme, and this is where the extra efforts are needed,â he said.

Dr OlivÃ© also appreciated the work of polio frontline workers who work tirelessly in all weather conditions, and across all terrains, to ensure that each and every child in every community is vaccinated and fully protected from polio.

The group met on Jan 11-12 in Islamabad to assess the programme progress, opportunities and the remaining challenges towards achieving the goal of stopping transmission of the poliovirus.

Prime Ministerâs Focal Person for Polio Eradication Babar Bin Atta said the government was committed to eradicating the poliovirus.

âI suggest that all parents should ensure that their children would be vaccinated. Civil society, media and religious scholars should also play their role to create awareness. I am hopeful the virus would be completely eradicated from Pakistan during year 2019,â he said.

Director General Ministry of National Health Services Dr Asad Hafeez said though the last mile to eradicate the virus was most difficult the government was committed to doing so.

National Coordinator Emergency Operation Centre for Polio Dr Rana Safdar said children who were missed during the campaigns become reason for the spread of poliovirus.

âHowever we are focussing more on the areas where poliovirus is present and hope that things will improve soon,â he said.

",1/13/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Athar Minallah on Saturday said live coverage of judgesâ speech and its subsequent airing on broadcast media is against the code of conduct of the adjudicators.

During the certificate distribution ceremony of a six-day training course on âLeadership and managementâ for district and sessions judges held at the Federal Judicial Academy, Justice Minallah stopped mediapersons from live coverage of his speech and also asked them not to even record the speech for subsequent airing, saying it was against the code of conduct of superior judiciary judges.

Justice Qazi Faez Isa of the Supreme Court in November last year had politely refused to answer questions asked by mediapersons after delivering a keynote address on âFuture of Pakistanâ in the UK, saying it was against the ethical practice if a judge speaks to the media.

Justice Athar Minallah stops mediapersons from live coverage and recording of his speech at certificate distribution ceremony

Justice Athar Minallah distributed certificates as chief guest among 25 heads of the district judiciary from all over Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir.

In his address, he said leadership and management training was vital for promoting and ensuring rule of law.

âIt is essential to be an effective leader so as to make an impact within your organisation.A single good leader can create an endless chain of social changes. First of all, a good leader always puts his or her house in order. District and sessions court judges are important leaders of judicial system because the district judiciary is an important tier of the administration of justice system.â

Justice Minallah also spoke about some of the important qualities of a good leader such as honesty, integrity, inspiring others, good communication and decision-making capabilities.

âFor all leaders whether they belong to politics, judiciary, sports or any other discipline, the attributes of good leadership are the same. When a leader is honest, his honesty has the trickle-down effect. District and sessions judges as leaders must put in practice their leadership attributes to reform the district judiciary and ameliorate the plight of the litigant public who are the key stakeholders of the administration of justice system.â

Lamenting growing nepotism in society, he said: âThe menace of nepotism has become a way of life in our society. As leaders, district and sessions court judges must play the desired role to combat nepotism which has permeated into the very fabric of society.â

The IHC CJ also highlighted issues related to petitioners and said after his maiden visit to the district courts Islamabad he realised the miseries of the citizens and was embarrassed to note that the courts gave relief to powerful while the cases of real stakeholders kept pending for decades.

âThere is no proper sitting area for the litigants in the district courts of Islamabad and the district administration should take appropriate steps to provide proper facilities to the litigants who come to seek justice from the courtsâ, he added.

Security agencies have also warned of any untoward incident within the district courts and the administration must adopt measures to ensure safety and security of the courts premises, he added.

The training course was carried out through syndicate discussions, command tasks, presentations and conducted in a participatory process. The participants obtained an in-depth understanding of leadership and management for effective administration of justice system.

",1/13/2019,"LAHORE: Former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar said Pakistan always chose to be a client state instead of becoming strategic partner of one country or the other. With a begging bowl in both hands, Pakistan cannot command respect in the comity of nations.

Speaking in a session on the US-Pakistan relationship at ThinkFest here on Saturday, she said Pakistan always imagined itself as a complete strategic partner, which was far-fetched. Pakistanâs most important relations should be with its neighbouring countries like Afghanistan, India, Iran and China instead of the US. âThe US does not deserve that much importance as is given in Pakistan because our economy is not dependent on US aid, as is widely believed.â

Referring to the incumbent rulersâ claims of copying China, she said Beijing had brought its people out of poverty, while the Islamabad rulers were doing the opposite.

United States Institute of Peace Associate Vice President Moeed Yusuf said the US-Pakistan relations were non-existent during the past 18 months. Regretting that Pakistan was looking elsewhere instead of involving itself in the region to resolve local and regional issues, he said there could be no conversation on the US-Pak ties till the Afghanistan issue was resolved. For Pakistan, he said, the idea was to consider how to work with the US and China simultaneously.

Speaking on the future of democracy in Pakistan, author Aqil Shah from Oklahoma University said democracy gave the freedom to speak up and enabled accommodating ethnic divisions peacefully. He, however, said the democracy in vogue in Pakistan was a hybrid regime where elected representatives were answerable to both the people and army generals.

He alleged that the 2018 general elections were manoeuvered to ensure that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his party did not come back to power and that the rule was given to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), calling the ruling party âPakistan Tehreek-i-Establishmentâ.

He further said that the corruption narrative was a universal phenomenon and not exclusive to Pakistan.

Federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood claimed that democracy in Pakistan was getting stronger and robust. While the PTI government took over just a few months ago, people had high expectations from them to resolve serious issues, including the economic crisis.

He said education had faced a serious neglect in the past and was separated into different streams to create a divide among people. He said there was a small pool of audience attending the ThinkFest, but even this much crowd could not be attracted if the event took place in Dera Ghazi Khan or Sibbi.

",1/13/2019,"LAHORE: Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmad says the government will have to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) sooner or later to improve the economic situation of the country.

âIn such a situation, the governments cannot avoid the IMF and the PTI government also will have to go to the IMF finally,â the minister told the media on the premises of the Planning and Development Department.

He said being a member of the Economic Coordination Committee he was in contact with Finance Minister Asad Umar on the matter of mini-budget and other issues.

âI am sure there would be no pressure on the poor in the mini-budget,â Mr Rashid believed, saying the government had collected about US $4 to 6 billion from other countries, enabling it to minimise its dependence on the IMF.

He appreciated Chief Minister Usman Buzdar for directing the P&D department to revive Nullah Lai project and complete it within the stipulated timeframe. The project cost had exceeded to Rs40bn from Rs16bn due to various issues â such as cost escalation and increase in length of the project for 6km, he claimed.

Says he will ask PM to accommodate him as PAC member

Earlier, at a press conference at the railways headquarters, Mr Rashid said he would ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to accommodate him as member of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) by dropping someone from the PTI.

âSince I am representing a separate political party, I will write to the PM to also include me in the PAC. There is no issue in my appointment as PAC member,â he said.

Talking about the ongoing reforms in the railways, he said there was a plan to construct shopping malls at Rohri and other major railway stations.

He said Railways would soon introduce a gift scheme on tickets just like some airlines give to their passengers.

He said the railways would soon launch two VVIP state-of-the-art trains wherein facilities and cleanliness would be provided like a five-star hotel.

âWe are inviting Prime Minister Imran Khan for inauguration of Lahore railway stationâs main hall and new trains,â he added.

",1/13/2019,"LAHORE: Former foreign minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri said long-lasting peace between Pakistan and India is possible through people-to-people contact.

âWe have taken the Kartarpur initiative believing that no progress can be achieved regarding peace between the two countries without people-to-people contact. In fact, long-lasting peace is only possible through this, but unfortunately it has not begun yet,â Mr Kasuri said at a talk, titled âIndian elections and the possibility of South Asian peaceâ, held on the first day of ThinkFest at Alhamra here on Saturday. Senior journalist Najam Sethi moderated the discussion.

Mr Kasuri said he was optimistic about resumption of talks between the two countries that would lead to good relations. âAs Prime Minister Imran Khan said, what option are we left with if not warâ¦ peace is the only option,â he said, adding that if the Indian opposition parties created a formidable alliance against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it might win and form the next government.

âAnd even if Mr Modi returns to power, he will have to hold peace talks with Pakistan. He has already come to Lahore,â he added.

Prof Dibyesh Anand of the University of Westminster, UK was critical of the Modi government, saying hate politics would not work for the BJP nor would anti-Pakistan politics. âInternal issues matter the most for them. Even in Pakistan people are more concerned about the internal issues.â

He predicted that the BJP might return to power in India, but with a thin majority.

Moeed Yusuf, associate vice president of the United States Institute of Peace, said six months were enough for the Modi-led BJP to cash in on the anti-Pakistan rhetoric as well as some domestic issues and it would likely return to power.

The panelists were of the view that India would eventually have to hold talks with Pakistan as there was no other option. They said that whichever party formed the government after this yearâs elections in India, it would resume dialogue with Pakistan.

A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar was hearing a suo motu case at the Lahore registry regarding losses and damage to life and property during a three-day long countrywide protest by religious parties led by the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after the apex court had acquitted Aasia Bibi.

The law officers of the provinces and officials of the Punjab home department appeared before the bench.

A Punjab law officer told the bench that the government assessed the value of the losses up to Rs262 million.

He said the provincial cabinet had approved a plan for the payment of the compensation to the affected people and the matter had been forwarded to the chief minister for the release of the funds.

Chief Justice Nisar regretted that had the court not taken notice of the peopleâs sufferings, the government would have been still making its plans. He said over two and a half months passed but a complete plan regarding compensation packages had not been submitted.

A section officer of the home department said the compensation would be paid to people within a month.

The bench disposed of the matter and directed the federal and the provincial governments to pay compensation to the victims within one month and submit a compliance report with the registrar of the court.

It warned that if ever Sindh was divided, PPPâs âbiased and racial policiesâ would be responsible for it.

Speaking at a press conference held at the partyâs district office, MQM-P deputy convener MNA Kanwar Naveed Jamil recalled that it was PPP that had introduced the quota system in 1970s to divide urban and rural population.

He said MQM always adopted the culture of Sindh, and added that it was he who, as the Hyderabad district nazim, had named a flyover after Hosh Mohammad Sheedi and got Sindhâs cultural heritage preserved. A monument of Sheedi was also built.

MNA Jamil said that a road network had been laid during the district government system but between 2010 and 2018, PPP government neglected Karachi and Hyderabad and the present destruction of Hyderabad city was reflective of its âbiasedâ policies.

He said it was criminal negligence of the government that people of Hyderabad were facing all kinds of problems today.

He noted that strongholds of MQM were hit by insanitation, collapsed sewerage system, broken roads and unending loadshedding of gas and electricity. He said despite MQMâs best efforts and announcement for a general university in Hyderabad, PPP was demonstrating slackness in its establishment.

Mr Jamil claimed that PPP government stopped funds for the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) to paralyse it; the trauma centre in the city was closed and its machinery was shifted somewhere else; a housing scheme was launched by the district government but the money of its allottees was utilised somewhere else; and child, cardiac and kidney care hospitals were approved but they were shifted to some other places.

He said PPP punished people of Hyderabad for electing MQM-P, adding that MQM-P was tolerating all kinds of excesses by the present Sindh government.

In order to raise peopleâs grievances, MQM-P had convened a public meeting in the city on Jan 18.

Mr Jamil said that his party supported across the board accountability and demanded that those who had looted the national wealth be brought to justice. He said according to an estimate, the countryâs Rs94,000bn had been shifted abroad.

He said MQM-P had some grievances against the federal government but currently it had no option other than remaining with the PTI government.

On Friday, the matter was fixed before the accountability court-II judge Aaliya Latif Unnar, when four accused appeared before the court on bail and two others were produced from prison.

The IO informed that Rauf Akhtar Farooqui was arrested in Islamabad following dismissal of his bail application by the Supreme Court on Jan 8. Earlier, he had escaped to avoid his arrest after his bail was recalled by the Sindh High Court.

The judge was informed that the federal anti-graft watchdog had filed a reference against eight persons accused of their involvement in illegal regularisation of 940 employees of the KPT, causing losses to the tune of Rs2.8bn to the national exchequer.

",1/13/2019,"KARACHI: Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) on Saturday stated that it was âextremely concernedâ over the âunacceptableâ increase in the prices of medicines by the federal government.

âThe announcement of 15 per cent hike in medicine prices by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan with the consent of the federal government is highly disappointing and unacceptable,â said Dr S.M. Qaisar Sajjad, secretary general of the PMA, in a statement issued here.

âIt is very distressing that instead of providing any relief to the people, the government had increased drug prices despite the fact that the older prices were already unaffordable,â he said.

He added that the painful aspect of the issue was that prices of lifesaving drugs had also been increased.

âIn such a situation when there is scarcity of health facilities at public hospitals, this increase in medicine prices will add to the miseries of people.â

Dr Sajjad said half of the countryâs population lived below the poverty line and they went to public hospitals for medical treatment.

âThe conditions in the public hospitals are very poor. It is responsibility of the government to improve these facilities; and it should provide free medicines to all the patients coming to the government hospitals.â

The PMA official suggested that the government should consider some other ways to minimise the impact of the increased prices of medicines because of devaluation of the rupee.

âIt could be done by supporting pharmaceutical companies through reducing taxes and cut in import duty of the raw material for drugs manufacturing and packaging. Vaccines and raw material for medicines should be produced in the country. Fake, counterfeit drugs and medicinesâ smuggling should be eliminated on a priority basis.â

The PMA demanded that the federal government review its decision and withdraw the notification regarding the increase in drug prices to lessen difficulties of poor people who were already suffering because of the irrepressible inflation and bad economic situation in the country.

",1/13/2019,"KARACHI: The administrative judge of the antiterrorism courts on Saturday remanded five suspects, said to be involved in an attack on the Chinese consulate general in Karachi last year, in police custody in explosives and illicit weapons cases.

The investigating officer, Nusrat Shaikh, produced the suspects â Ahmed Hussain, Nadir Khan alias Baladi, Ali Ahmed alias Hashim, Abdul Latif and Mohammad Aslam â before the judge and submitted that they were arrested during a raid in Sadiq Baloch Goth, Taiser Town, and explosive substances as well as unlicensed weapons were found in their possession.

The IO submitted that the suspects were required for questioning as the police had to arrest their absconding accomplices and trace their criminal record since they were also involved in some other cases.

Police filed an âA-classâ report last month stating that suspects in Chinese CG case are not traceable

The administrative judge handed over the suspects to the police on five-day physical remand and directed the IO to produce them again on the next date along with a progress report.

A main case was registered against the suspects under Sections 4/5 of Explosive Substances Act, 1908 read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at the Gulshan-i-Maymar police station. They were also booked in four connected cases under Section 21(i)(a) of Sindh Arms Act, 2013.

The remand papers were silent about their alleged involvement in the Chinese CG attack and their affiliation with any banned militant outfit.

It was mentioned in the FIRs that police conducted a raid on a tip-off that the accomplices of the militants who attacked the Chinese CG were planning to carry out more attacks.

However, the Karachi police chief had told a press conference on Friday that the held suspects facilitated the militants who stormed the Chinese mission in Karachi and were associated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).

Three heavily armed militants carried out the gun-and-grenade attack on the consulate in a high-security zone of Clifton on Nov 23, 2018 in which two policemen and two visa applicants (father and son) were killed before the suspects were gunned down. One private security guard of the foreign mission sustained injuries.

Last month, police had filed an A-class report in the consulate attack case stating that the suspects were not traceable.

Justice Gulzar Ahmed of the SC presided over a meeting at the apex courtâs Karachi registry about encroachments. The meeting was attended by officials of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Karachi Development Authority, Sindh Building Control Authority, Pakistan Railways, cantonment boards and others. Progress reports were submitted to the court.

Sources said that the apex court judge directed the authorities to remove encroachments from the cityâs parks within a week, stop the charity organisations from using footpaths for food distribution, demolish a wall illegally built near a shopping mall in Clifton and remove illegal parking lots around restaurants and residential buildings as well as commercial activities on military land.

Justice Ahmed also directed the Railways to continue its operation against encroachments to revive the Karachi Railway Circular, they added.

After the meeting, Metropolitan Commissioner Saif-ur-Rehman told reporters that the apex court also ordered removal of the nurseries from footpaths and green belts of the city. He contended that the KMC had so far removed around 90 per cent encroachments in the provincial metropolis.

",1/13/2019,"KARACHI: Retailers have pushed up prices of essential food items including sugar and vegetables prices ahead of the mini-budget which will be announced on Jan 23.

Sugar now costs Rs60 per kg versus Rs55 per kg a few days ago following an increase in the wholesale price to Rs57-58 per kg from Rs55 per kg. Two months ago, the wholesale price of sugar was Rs52-53 per kg.

Retailers with old stocks of sweetener are now taking full advantage of the fresh price hike in wholesale markets and are demanding Rs5 per kg more from consumers.

Talking to Dawn, Patron-in-Chief Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA) Anis Majeed said the issue of late cane crushing and reports of low sugarcane crop can be blamed for the recent price hike.

The price may remain under pressure as a number of mills have yet to start cane crushing over price dispute, he said. However, he ruled out any shortage of sugar in the wholesale market.

Mr Majeed feared further price shocks in case the government raises import duties on raw materials and finished items in the mini budget.

Pakistanâs sugar exports plunged to 182,142 tonnes ($55.5 million) in 5MFY19 from 320,593 tonnes ($129m) in same period last year. In FY18, sugar exports swelled to $1.469m tonnes ($508m) from 307,348 tonnes ($161m) in FY17. Sugar production fell by seven per cent to 6.565m tonnes in FY18 from 7.048m tonnes in FY17.

Pricey tea whiteners, colas

The price of Nestle tea whitener 950 gram pack went up to Rs865 from Rs825 while 375 grams pack now costs Rs425 as against Rs400. The company did not mention any reason of price rise in a letter issued to retailers.

Despite the ongoing winter season, soft drink manufacturers have also increased the prices of beverages.

The price of one litre and 1.5 litre cola bottles produced by two main beverage makers surged by Rs5 per bottle, followed by Rs 10 increase for jumbo bottles.

Vegetables become expensive

Not to be left out, vegetable retailers are making huge windfalls by charging over 100 per cent profit from consumers on wholesale rates.

The retail price of onion is now Rs 30 per kgm from Rs 25 per kg earlier on. In Sabzi Mandi, wholesale price of onion hovers between Rs10-15 per kg.

The same situation exists for potato. The retail price of the root vegetable has been raised to Rs30 per kg from Rs20 per kg, while its wholesale price hovers between Rs10-12 per kg.

Tomato can be purchased at Rs40 per kg which was selling at Rs 20-30 per kg. Its wholesale price is Rs 20-25 per kg.

President Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market New Sabzi Mandi Super Highway Haji Shahjehan said retailers are depriving consumers from taking benefit of low rates of Sindhâs onion and tomato crop and Punjabâs potato crop.

Transportation charges have definitely increased due to Rs23 per kg hike in CNG rates coupled with diesel and LPG prices which have pushed up the cost of living for everyone, he said.

Cucumber and turrai now sell at Rs80 per kg which were priced Rs40-50 per kg. Lokki and tinday are now available at Rs60 and Rs80 per kg as against Rs40 per kg each few days back. Shimla mirch (capsicum) prices moved up to Rs80 from Rs60 per kg. Bhindi (lady finger) is available at Rs120 as against Rs80 per kg.

A retailer said tomato prices are rising as the vegetable could not ripe due to low temperatures. As a result, unripe tomatoes are being sold in the market in larger quantities.

",1/13/2019,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoplesâ Party (PPP) has rejected the governmentâs plan to unveil a mini-budget later this month.

Parliamentary leader of the PPP in the Senate Sherry Rehman in a statement expressed her reservations over the ever-increasing price hike and governmentâs plans to introduce a mini-budget to make lives of the common man more miserable.

Strongly opposing the plan, Ms Rehman asked if the government which was determined to bring about a revolution would introduce mini-budgets every four months. She advised the government to prepare for the annual budget, saying that this was not the time to unveil a mini-budget.

She observed that the mini- budget was being unveiled to meet the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). âWe strongly oppose the decision,â she said. Ms Rehman regretted that the government continued to levy new taxes and increase the prices of one or the other commodity every month.

She regretted that just a day after increase in the prices of drugs, the government announced its plans about unveiling a mini-budget. âThe tsunami of change has turned into a price hike tornado,â she remarked and pointed out that the rate of inflation which stood at 5.8 per cent had gone up to 6.2pc while the growth rate had substantially gone down. Ms Rehman said that those who talked of business-friendly policies had devastated businesses. She said the government had no direction and had failed to efficiently run the economy.

The PPP leader said that the government had done nothing except chanting slogans of accountability and setting the economy aright.

Talking to Dawn, she said that the economy appeared to be in shambles while âaccountabilityâ was merely being used as a tool against political opponents. She said that the opposition demanded that the government reverse its policy of witch-hunt and stop taking steps that added to the problems being faced by the people.

",1/13/2019,"GILGIT: Despite continuous snowfall and harsh temperatures, three foreign expeditions have entered decisive stages in the quest to scale the most challenging peaks of K2 and Nanga Parbat.

A foreign expedition team, comprising Daniele Nardi from Italy with Britainâs Thomas Ballard and two Pakistanis Rehmatullah Baig and Karim Hayat, are currently attempting to develop a new route on Mummery Spur to scale Nanga Parbat. They reached camp 3 at 5,714 metres through a new route on Saturday. The team had started the expedition on Dec 24, 2018.

Daniel Nardi, the team leader, through a satellite phone informed Dawn that the deteriorating weather conditions at Nanga Parbat had caused hurdles to progress.

He said that the team had scaled to camp 3 but heavy snowfall and speedy winds had forced it to descend back to the base camp. The team would continue its expedition as soon as the weather conditions improved, he added.

Meanwhile, two other foreign expedition teams are en route to the K2 base camp. Climbers of these teams are from Russia, KazakÂ­hstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland and Spain and Nepali Sherpas.

One team is led by Vassiliy Pivtsov from Kazakhstan and Artem Brown from RusÂ­sia is their project organiser.

Elena Laletina, official secretary of the other team â Russian K2 expedition 2019 â said that the climbers were on their way to the K2 base camp. She said that they had left Urdukas on Saturday morning and the team would be at the base camp by next week. The team has planned to attempt K2 through the Abruzzi Spur route.

Famous mountaineer Karim Shah Nizari told Dawn that it was very challenging to climb K2 and Nanga Parbat in winter through the Mummery Spur route. He said that the success of the expedition teams seemed difficult.

Both teams, he said, had already lost important days of the season and the weather conditions did not seem to be suitable for completion of the expeditions on time.

182,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457172/govt-asked-to-withdraw-hike-in-prices-of-medicines,"Govt asked to withdraw hike in prices of medicines
",1/13/2019,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and some of the stakeholders of the health sector have criticised a sudden increase in prices of various medicines and urged the government to withdraw the decision as middle and lower classes would suffer the most because of it.

Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, the spokesman for PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has said that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government is preying on the people by hiking the prices.

The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) on Friday had announced up to 15 per cent increase in prices of various medicines.

He said the constant increase in prices of goods was unacceptable and would not be tolerated. The government first snatched the calm of the people and was now snatching their lives by increasing the prices of medicines, he said.

âThe governmentâs only performance has been taking from the people the facilities provided to them. In the guise of claims of providing people with five million houses, the government has only rendered people homeless,â Senator Khokhar said.

He said that the governmentâs conduct had been disappointing and it was only a matter of time that the people of Pakistan would start protesting against the injustice and biased attitude of the PTI rule. The government had proven itself to be a destructive tsunami, he concluded.

Secretary General of the Pakistan Medical Association Dr Qaisar Sajjad has stated that the association was very much concerned over the hike in medicine prices.

âThe government should find other ways to minimise the effect of increasing the cost of medicines because of the rupeeâs devaluation. It could be done by supporting pharmaceutical companies by reducing taxes and duty on import of raw materials for manufacturing drugs. Vaccines and raw materials should be produced locally. Fake and counterfeit drugs and smuggling of medicines should be eliminated on a priority basis,â Dr Sajjad said.

Pakistan Islamic Medical Associationâs president Prof Afzal Mian said the rising inflation had exposed the governmentâs inability to plan for welfare of the nation. Even if the excuse of devaluation was accepted, it is deplorable that the crunch was yet again transferred to the people who were struggling to survive, he added.

However, Pharma Bureauâs Executive Director Ayesha Tammy Haq while talking to Dawn said that the increase was not sufficient as most of the medicine prices were increased by 9pc while the rupee was devalued by over 30pc.

âChief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar had also directed the government and Drap to increase the prices of medicines, considering the hike in the dollarâs value and finally it has been done,â she said.

Ms Haq said that although the increase was not sufficient it would help the pharmaceutical companies to survive. âWe expect that the prices will be further increased at the end of the financial year, considering the Consumer Price Index,â she said.

In reply to a question, she said that the government could have reduced the taxes rather than passing the burden to patients, but it did not go for that option.

",1/13/2019,"LAHORE: Punjab Minister for Health Dr Yasmin Rashid on Saturday told the Supreme Court that the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute (PKLI) would start conducting paediatric liver transplant within six months.

The minister also informed a two-judge SC bench that the Punjab cabinet had approved a draft legislation to abolish the trust of the PKLI which would be run by the government through a board of governors (BoG) after its approval by the chief minister and the provincial assembly.

The bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, was hearing a matter regarding alleged irregularities at the PKLI and any possibility to conduct paediatric liver transplant at it.

Punjab cabinet approves draft legislation to abolish the instituteâs trust and take over its management, says health minister

Dr Rashid said she along with the chief minister had recently visited the PKLI and had a detailed meeting with doctors over there. She said the doctors assured the government that the institute would be able to hold the first-ever paediatric liver transplant in the public sector by June.

Advocate Zafar Iqbal Kalanuri, however, raised objection to the composition of the BoG and said the government wanted to appoint certain officials at the institute to take control of its affairs.

However, the minister dispelled the impression and assured the court that no official from the previous government would be made part of the BoG.

At the hearing, the chief justice also took notice of a negative propaganda campaign being run in government circles against Dr Rashid in the light of harsh remarks of the court regarding her working. He said the remarks had been misconstrued.

âI was personally very happy when you were given the portfolio of health,â Chief Justice Nisar told

Dr Rashid and added that it was his wish to see a practising doctor run the health ministry.

CJP says he wonât let minister resign

The minister said the opposition parties in the provincial assembly had also demanded her resignation.

âYou need not to be worried about criticism. Look at me, who else can face criticism more than I experienced,â CJP Nisar said while giving her assurance that he would not let her resign.

Meanwhile, Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Director General Hussain Asghar submitted an inquiry report about the institute.

He said the project, which was supposed to be completed by December 2017, was still under construction. He said no action had been taken against the contractors for delaying the project.

He said some government officials were involved in misappropriation of funds and a detailed investigation could be held after registration of a case against them.

Representing the previous management of the institute, Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan objected to the fairness of the report. He said the ACE report was mainly based on a forensic audit report that itself carried grave factual mistakes.

He also requested the bench to stop the ACE from registration of an FIR till the submission of a reply to the report. âThe FIR carries a big stigma,â he added.

The bench did not pass any restraining order to this effect but directed the ACE not to cause any illegal arrest in the case. The court also asked Barrister Ahsan and other counsel of the PKLIâs old management to submit their replies on the report by Jan 16.

Next hearing will be held at Islamabad.

Addressing a public meeting here on Saturday after inaugurating Kotri-Jamshoro overhead bridge, he said the PPP had faced âGen Ziaâs lashes and Gen Musharrafâs prisons and exileâ and it was not afraid of the incumbent âpuppet and benami prime ministerâ.

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, PPP provincial president Nisar Khuhro and MPA Malik Asad Sikandar also spoke on the occasion.

PPP leader warns PTI govt against testing patience of jiyalas

Mr Bhutto-Zardari said if the people of Sindh, Balochistan, southern Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa decided to âtake on Islamabadâ to secure their rights and protest against deprivation, it would prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the âfake governmentâ.

He warned the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government against testing patience of PPP jiyalas, saying if it didnât refrain from it, the PPP would show it how âtheft of voteâ was avenged.

He said the PPP preferred service delivery like construction of bridges over the River Indus, canal lining, road networks, subsidy to farmers and provision of employment in Thar and quality cardiac care services.

He said the âselected prime ministerâ and the Punjab chief minister could not compete with the Sindh chief minister.

âYour plan to oust us through conspiracies has failed and you will fail again,â he said while addressing PM Imran Khan.

He said an inept federal government was meting out step-motherly treatment to the people of Sindh who were being punished for voting for the PPP.

He said Imran Khan needed to learn principles of politics before talking about principled politics and added that the finger of umpire worked in cricket and the peopleâs will in politics.

He accused the PTI of making false promises and fraudulent claims and said Pakistan was heading backwards under its government. âThe national economy remains weak and people are drowning in the tsunami of price hike while mills and shops are being closed.â

The PPP leader said poor people didnât have two square meals a day because their sources of livelihood had been snatched.

He said those who talked about providing 10 million jobs and five million houses to people had snatched from them already available job opportunities and deprived them of shelter.

âPakistan does not have electricity, gas and investment but the federal ministers are claiming there is no price hike and advising people to be patient. The eyes of the ministers are closed with arrogance and minds intoxicated with power while their hearts are insensitiveâ, he said.

Mr Bhutto-Zardari accused the government of closing water and electricity supplies to Sindh which contributed 80pc of gas produced in Pakistan.

He said billions of rupees of the Sindh government had been withheld which badly affected development process.

He asked for what crime the people of Sindh were being pushed against wall and then answered his question, saying because they did not vote for âpuppetsâ and were loyal to the Bhuttos.

He said the government didnât know how the rupee got devalued and the wheels of economy got jammed although it claimed to be working faster than lightâs speed.

âThe government doesnât know how the debt of Rs5bn has increased but those who said they preferred suicide over the begging bowl are now celebrating foreign borrowingsâ.

Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the federal government had tried to commit robbery over the mandate of Sindh in just three months but got only disappointment and shelved the plan.

185,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457176/cjps-order-termed-void-days-before-his-retirement,"CJPâs order termed void days before his retirement
",1/13/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Another judge of the Supreme Court has declared the order of Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, who is going to doff his robes on January 17, about reconstituting a bench of the Peshawar registry in the middle of a hearing void and non-est.

In the absence of any recusal from any member of the bench, the reconstitution of a smaller bench by removing a judge (Justice Qazi Faez Isa), who had questioned the exercise of suo motu powers, would amount to stifling the independent view of the judge that could shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in a six-page strongly worded order.

He said his order be read into other cases fixed before the three-member bench on that day and which were again fixed before the reconstituted two-member bench. âAll those cases are to be put up for rehearing before an appropriate bench again to be constituted by the chief justice and record of the court must reflect the correct status of these cases,â the order stated.

Judgeâs removal from SC bench after he questioned legality of suo motu proceedings amounts to shaking the foundation of impartial justice system, observes Justice Mansoor Ali Shah

Justice Shah agreed with the viewpoint expressed by Justice Isa who had raised objection to the reconstituting of the smaller bench whilst hearing the case in March 2018. The bench comprising Justice Isa, Justice Shah and CJP Nisar was reconstituted after Justice Isa questioned the legality of the proceedings related to hospital waste. Justice Isa was excluded from the reconstituted bench that comprised Justice Shah and the CJP.

In a separate note, Justice Isa had objected to the exercise of Article 184(3) of the Constitution by holding that before exercising its original jurisdiction, the SC must satisfy itself that the jurisdiction it is assuming accords with the Constitution. Justice Isa had also held that he was constrained to write this, since not doing so would weigh heavily on his conscience and he would be abdicating his responsibility as a judge.

Now Justice Shah in a separate note admitted that his sitting on the reconstituted two-member bench was a mistake and having realised that after examining the legal position, he did not sign the orders passed by the reconstituted bench but as a junior member of the bench, awaited for the CJP to pass an appropriate order in response to the reaction of Justice Isa. He waited for the appropriate order by the CJP to respond to the note of Justice Isa by explaining the reasons of the reconstitution of the smaller bench on that day, Justice Shah observed. But no such order was passed till date and the case had been incorrectly reflected in the bench disposal statement as an adjourned case, Justice Shah recalled.

âThe chief justice is retiring on Jan 17, therefore, I feel constitutionally obligated, as a member of the bench, to express my views regarding the order of brother [Justice Isa] and to pass my order in this case for May 19, 2018 when it came up for hearing before the bench.â

In his opinion, Justice Shah explained, a bench once constituted and is seized of a matter on the judicial side, cannot be reconstituted by the chief justice in exercise of his administrative powers, unless a member of the bench withdrew himself from the bench.

Thus the reconstitution of the bench on that day was unwarranted and unprecedented and undermined the integrity of the judicial system, wrote Justice Shah.

In the absence of a recusal by a member of the bench, Justice Shah observed, any amount of disagreement amongst members of the bench on an issue before them, could not form a valid ground for reconstitution of the bench. And any reconstitution of the bench on this ground would impinge on the constitutional value of independence of the judiciary, he added.

âThe construct of judicial system is pillared on the assumption that every judge besides being fair and impartial is fiercely independent and is free to uphold his judicial view,â Justice Shah said, adding this judicial freedom was foundational to the concept of rule of law. Thus the reconstitution of the bench while hearing the case, in the absence of any recusal from any member on the bench or due to any other reason, would amount to stifling the independent view of the judge and any effort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an alternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, he feared.

âThis erodes the public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands,â he stated. Public confidence was the most precious asset that this branch of the state (judiciary) had, Justice Shah stated, adding it was also one of the most precious assets of the nation.

Citing from international jurisdictions, Justice Shah recalled how Prof Ahraon Barack pointed out that a judge ought to be aware of his power and the limits thereof. âNaturally, the judge knows the law and the power it grants to the judge, but he must also learn the limits imposed on him as a judge.â

Also, a judge must recognise his mistakes, Justice Shah said, adding that like all mortals judges erred but a judge must admit this.

While quoting Justice Jacksonâs statement âwe are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are finalâ, Justice Shah stated: âI think the learned judge erred. The finality of our decision is based on our ability to admit our mistakes and our willingness to do so in appropriate cases.â

Justice Shah also cited âThe Charter of Rights and Freedom: A Judicial Perspectiveâ in which McLachlim Beverly noted that if judges admitted their mistakes they would strengthen public confidence in the judiciary. Besides, he said, in writing and thinking, judges must âdisplay modesty and an absence of arroganceâ. Statements such as those of Chief Justice Hughes that âwe are under the Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it isâ are not merely incorrect but also perniciously arrogant, Justice Shah observed.

He said his order be read into other cases fixed before the three-member bench on that day and which were again fixed before the reconstituted two-member bench. âAll those cases are to be put up for rehearing before an appropriate bench again to be constituted by the chief justice and record of the court must reflect the correct status of these cases,â the order said.

The request filed by Hayat's mother, which was submitted before the court's human rights cell, was reviewed by Chief Justice Nisar. The petition called for the Supreme Court's attention to the fact that a mentally ill prisoner was being sentenced to death.

It has stated that the judgment passed by Lahore High Court ""is not in accordance with law and the Prison Rules"".

The petition has also argued that the court has ""mixed the conviction with execution and thereby has dismissed the writ petition on wrong premises"".

It further argued that neither the medical history of the petitioner's son has been taken into account and nor have the medical board's reports been considered which establish the prisoner's ailment.

The petition notes that ""the extensive jail medical records establishing the mental ailment of the condemned prisoner are sufficient to withhold the execution of death sentence till the time the condemned prisoner is fully recovered from the ailment"".

Moreover, the petition has also stated: ""There is no way that Khizar Hayatâs execution can be carried out in a manner that complies with Pakistanâs obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the UN Convention against Torture.""

Hayat was sentenced to death in 2003 over the shooting of a fellow police officer. He has spent nearly 15 years on death row. He was first diagnosed as a schizophrenic in 2008 by jail medical authorities. In 2010, the jail medical officer recommended that Hayat needed specialised treatment and should be shifted to the psychiatric facility. However, this was never done.

In 2017, the Lahore High Court had stayed the execution of Hayat.

On Monday, a two-member bench comprising Justice Manzoor Ahmad Malik and Justice Sardar Tariq Masoof will hear the case.

Hayat's mother, in a letter, requested the chief justice to visit Kot Lakhpat jail's ward for mentally ill prisoners and investigate what medicines were being given to her son.

She pleaded that his medical records be investigated ""to determine why his treatment was not being done properly and why his condition was worsening day by day"".

""I read in Dawn that a prisoner named Khizar Hayat has been sentenced to be hanged,"" the chief justice remarked, inquiring from the Punjab attorney general which jail Hayat was serving his sentence in. The official replied it was Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail.

Justice Nisar asked that it be immediately ascertained if Hayat has been diagnosed as mentally ill and sought a report today.

Meanwhile, Justice Project Pakistan (JPP), which has been contesting the case, has been running a campaign on social media, asking President Arif Alvi to ""grant mercy"" to Hayat. According to Article 45 of the Constitution, the president has the ""power to grant pardon, reprieve and respite, and to remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by any court, tribunal or other authority"".

Earlier on Saturday, a press conference was organised by the Pakistan Psychiatric Society to call to attention the prisoner's execution.

""All medical officers who have examined Khizar Hayat over the years have found him to be actively exhibiting schizophrenic symptoms,"" said Dr Usman Ahmad Hotiana of the Pakistan Psychiatric Society. ""In 2009, Khizar's mental illness got so severe that he got horribly beaten by his fellow prisoners. His injuries were severe enough to require surgeries. After that, he was put in solitary confinement.""",Rana Bilal,Dawn,Judiciary,"Chief Justice, Saqib Nisar, Khizer Hayat, death row",1,"['chief', 'justice', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'saturday', 'took', 'notice', 'media', 'reports', 'regarding', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'khizer', 'hayat', 'mentally', 'ill', 'prisoner', 'death', 'row', 'announced', 'suspend', 'sentence', 'till', 'orders', 'moreover', 'chief', 'justice', 'also', 'fixed', 'matter', 'hearing', 'monday', 'january', '14', 'read', 'statement', 'issued', 'supreme', 'court', 'earlier', 'day', 'hayat', 'mother', 'iqbal', 'bano', 'moved', 'court', 'calling', 'suspension', 'death', 'sentence', 'grounds', 'mental', 'illness', 'friday', 'district', 'sessions', 'judge', 'lahore', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'hayat', 'deathrow', 'prisoner', 'diagnosed', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'january', '15', 'central', 'jail', 'kot', 'lakhpat', 'request', 'filed', 'hayat', 'mother', 'submitted', 'court', 'human', 'rights', 'cell', 'reviewed', 'chief', 'justice', 'nisar', 'petition', 'called', 'supreme', 'court', 'attention', 'fact', 'mentally', 'ill', 'prisoner', 'sentenced', 'death', 'stated', 'judgment', 'passed', 'lahore', 'high', 'court', 'accordance', 'law', 'prison', 'rules', 'petition', 'also', 'argued', 'court', 'mixed', 'conviction', 'execution', 'thereby', 'dismissed', 'writ', 'petition', 'wrong', 'premises', 'argued', 'neither', 'medical', 'history', 'petitioner', 'son', 'taken', 'account', 'medical', 'board', 'reports', 'considered', 'establish', 'prisoner', 'ailment', 'petition', 'notes', 'extensive', 'jail', 'medical', 'records', 'establishing', 'mental', 'ailment', 'condemned', 'prisoner', 'sufficient', 'withhold', 'execution', 'death', 'sentence', 'till', 'time', 'condemned', 'prisoner', 'fully', 'recovered', 'ailment', 'moreover', 'petition', 'also', 'stated', 'way', 'khizar', 'hayatas', 'execution', 'carried', 'manner', 'complies', 'pakistanas', 'obligations', 'international', 'covenant', 'civil', 'political', 'rights', 'un', 'convention', 'torture', 'hayat', 'sentenced', 'death', '2003', 'shooting', 'fellow', 'police', 'officer', 'spent', 'nearly', '15', 'years', 'death', 'row', 'first', 'diagnosed', 'schizophrenic', '2008', 'jail', 'medical', 'authorities', '2010', 'jail', 'medical', 'officer', 'recommended', 'hayat', 'needed', 'specialised', 'treatment', 'shifted', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'however', 'never', 'done', '2017', 'lahore', 'high', 'court', 'stayed', 'execution', 'hayat', 'monday', 'twomember', 'bench', 'comprising', 'justice', 'manzoor', 'ahmad', 'malik', 'justice', 'sardar', 'tariq', 'masoof', 'hear', 'case', 'hayat', 'mother', 'letter', 'requested', 'chief', 'justice', 'visit', 'kot', 'lakhpat', 'jail', 'ward', 'mentally', 'ill', 'prisoners', 'investigate', 'medicines', 'given', 'son', 'pleaded', 'medical', 'records', 'investigated', 'determine', 'treatment', 'done', 'properly', 'condition', 'worsening', 'day', 'day', 'read', 'dawn', 'prisoner', 'named', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'sentenced', 'hanged', 'chief', 'justice', 'remarked', 'inquiring', 'punjab', 'attorney', 'general', 'jail', 'hayat', 'serving', 'sentence', 'official', 'replied', 'lahore', 'kot', 'lakhpat', 'jail', 'justice', 'nisar', 'asked', 'immediately', 'ascertained', 'hayat', 'diagnosed', 'mentally', 'ill', 'sought', 'report', 'today', 'meanwhile', 'justice', 'project', 'pakistan', 'jpp', 'contesting', 'case', 'running', 'campaign', 'social', 'media', 'asking', 'president', 'arif', 'alvi', 'grant', 'mercy', 'hayat', 'according', 'article', '45', 'constitution', 'president', 'power', 'grant', 'pardon', 'reprieve', 'respite', 'remit', 'suspend', 'commute', 'sentence', 'passed', 'court', 'tribunal', 'authority', 'earlier', 'saturday', 'press', 'conference', 'organised', 'pakistan', 'psychiatric', 'society', 'call', 'attention', 'prisoner', 'execution', 'medical', 'officers', 'examined', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'years', 'found', 'actively', 'exhibiting', 'schizophrenic', 'symptoms', 'said', 'dr', 'usman', 'ahmad', 'hotiana', 'pakistan', 'psychiatric', 'society', '2009', 'khizar', 'mental', 'illness', 'got', 'severe', 'got', 'horribly', 'beaten', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'injuries', 'severe', 'enough', 'require', 'surgeries', 'put', 'solitary', 'confinement']"

",1/12/2019,"The second edition of the National Academy of Performing Artsâ (Napa) Laughter Fest began on Thursday night with a play titled Haye Muhabbat.

To be honest, it was not a bad effort. It had its moments. But one is not sure if it was worthy enough to start an 11-day-long festival with.

The tightrope that a theatre director walks in putting together a dialogue-driven drama is to know at what stage or till what time the use of funny words ââ innuendo, repartee, punch line ââ will become predictable for the audience. Mind you, the interest of those who had packed the Zia Mohyeddin auditorium on Thursday did not waver too much. Still, there were many a moment where âlaughterâ, the USP of the fest, appeared to be a rare commodity. And the actors hadnât brought their A-game, either.

Written by Babar Jamal and directed by Uzma Sabeen, Haye Muhabbat tells the tale of Kashi (Samhan Ghazi), a forty-something man leading a loveless life. When the play begins he dials a number from his (landline) telephone (whose short handset cord was causing the actor trouble and a lapse in concentration) to try his luck one last time. He finds Neelofar (Zarqa Naz) at the other end. She is in her thirties and is also looking for someone to have a romantic relationship with. After a bit of a whacky conversation, they decide to meet at a restaurant. To his surprise, when he reaches the restaurant, he finds out that Neelofar has brought along her mother (Shumaila Taj). This gives away the mental state of Neelofar to Kashi, and instead of him following her, she starts to stalk him, trying to persuade him to get married to her.

Her dodgy intent is further highlighted when, while visiting his house for the first time, her mamoo (Hammad Khan) tags along to sort out some legal stuff. All of this drives Kashi up the wall. And yet, he canât do anything about it. The girl is pushier than he initially thought she was.

Haye Muhabbat heavily relies on the conversations between its male and female protagonists. It works, although in patches. Zarqa Naz plays a talkative character. Unfortunately, her loquaciousness as Neelofar made her say her lines with such rapidity that it was often difficult to understand the tone of her voice. On the other hand, Shumaila Taj as her mother and therapist had a voice-projection issue, which is strange, because both the girls have a reasonable wealth of experience as theatre artists.

One has mentioned this because one has seen all these individuals grow as artists in recent years. They are competent. But who can dodge a lean patch?

",1/12/2019,"The Supreme Court on Saturday ordered the federal and provincial governments to compensate within one month the affectees of violent protests held in the wake of the release of Aasia Bibi â a Christian woman previously condemned to death on blasphemy charges.

A two-member bench, under Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar's stewardship, was hearing a suo motu case at the Lahore registry.

Read: These 7 points explain the Supreme Court's decision to free Aasia Bibi

Punjab advocate general, at the outset of the hearing, told the court that losses have been estimated to the tune of Rs262 million, adding that the cabinet has approved the estimated figure.

""You have submitted reports [on estimated loss] but what about the time frame and the mode of payments,"" the chief justice asked.

""Have you devised a plan or is this [merely] paperwork?"" Justice Aijazul Ahsan enquired.

At this, the interior department's section officer assured the bench that payments will be made during the ongoing month.

The court ordered the provincial government to submit an implementation report after making payments within a month.

During the last hearing of the suo motu notice on loss of properties during violent protest against the release of Aasia Bibi, the apex court had directed the federal and provincial governments to submit their plans for the payment of compensation to those who lost their lives and properties during protests.

Justice Nisar had exprÂ­eÂ­ssÂ­ed dissatisfaction over reports submitted by the governments of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber PakhtunÂ­khwa about the loss of lives and damage caused to private property by the protesters.

A Punjab law officer had told the bench that as many as 2,936 activists and their leaders had been detained. He said 503 cases were registered, including 26 under terrorism charges. He had added that the damage caused to public property had been estimated at Rs40.6 million.

The law officer said the damage to private property was estimated at Rs3.3m in the province.

The government should have invited the claims through newspaper advertisement, Justice Ijazul Ahsan had observed and said the report was not satisfactory, rather a faulty one.

An additional home secretary had told the bench that the matter of mode of compensation amount would soon be taken up by the provincial cabinet.

The Sindh IGP had told the bench that 342 protesters were arrested in 41 cases registered by the police. The report filed by the KP government showed that 62 people were arrested. It said the protesters had not caused any major damage to public and private property in the province.

",1/12/2019,"The federal government has decided not to enter an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme for now, Finance Minister Asad Umar said on Saturday.

The finance minister made the remarks while talking to businessmen at the Karachi Chamber of Commence and Industry (KCCI).

Umar said that instead of rushing into the IMF programme, the government was exploring alternative options.

Furthermore, the finance minister announced that the government will unveil a mini-budget on Jan 23 instead of Jan 21. He associated the two-day delay to an impending foreign trip of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The finance minister said that his visits of Lahore and Karachi were regarding a one-point agenda: the amended finance bill, which he said will facilitate businessmen.

Umar indicated that the amended bill will also carry ""some good news"" for the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) .

The minister said that he consulted all stakeholders over the upcoming mini-budget, assuring the assortment of businessmen that tax anomalies will be eliminated in the budget.

The minister rejected the impression that the government was only borrowing money, stressing that several agreements have also been signed to bring investment into the country.

""The impacts of the investment agreements will start surfacing from the next week,"" he added.

Asad Umar, even before he was sworn in, had said that the economy would need an infusion of more than $12 billion within six weeks.

In a later interview with Bloomberg, he had said that the nationâs financial gap was somewhere between $10bn to $12bn, adding that the new government would need a bit extra so it doesnât âlive on the edgeâ.

In October last year, Saudi Arabia had announced a $6 billion bailout package for Pakistanâs ailing economy. The package includes $3bn in balance of payments support and just as much in deferred payments on oil imports.

The UAE had also announced a package exactly the same size and terms and conditions as given by Saudi Arabia. The all-weather friend, China too, had pledged to lend $2 billion to Pakistan to shore up dwindling foreign exchange reserves.

Moreover, Islamabad and Riyadh are expected to ink memorandum of understanding (MoUs) to bring in Saudi investment in excess of $10bn this month. Pakistan is also eyeing similar MoUs with China, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia over the next two months.

The federal cabinet has also approved a strategy to issue so-called 'Panda bonds' in the Chinese market to raise foreign exchange from global markets.

'Budget bomb'

Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in a statement strongly opposed the government's upcoming mini-budget.

The party's vice president, Senator Sherry Rehman, expressed grave reservations against rising inflation and the government's announcement of the mini budget.

""Will this inquilab sarkar (revolutionary government) announce a new mini budget every four months?"" she asked.

She said that the government should make preparations for an annual budget and that this was not the time to announce a mini budget.

The PPP leader likened the decision to a ""budget bomb"" being dropped on the people, based on supposed conditions put forth by the IMF.

""Every month new taxes are being imposed and some commodity or the other sees a hike in prices.

""One day the prices of medicines go up and the next, a mini budget is announced,"" Rehman said adding that the government is ""robbing the people of the right to live"".

She said that the ""tsunami of change"" had now transformed into a ""storm of inflation"".

Rehman recalled that inflation stood at 5.8 per cent in July, whereas now it had gone up to 6.2pc.

She said that those who claimed being ""friends of businessmen"" are in fact their enemies and declared that the government is incapable of running the economy.

",1/12/2019,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar on Saturday lauded Punjab Health Minister Dr Yasmeen Rashid's performance and advised her to not be fazed by criticism.

Dr Rashid has been on the receiving end of severe criticism by the chief justice in recent weeks, first over the issue of Punjab Healthcare Commission's board and then on a lack of legislation regarding Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute.

The chief justice had expressed his disappointment with Dr Rashid's performance since taking charge, saying that he had a lot of expectations from her.

However, in what seemed a departure from his evaluation of the minister's conduct, the chief justice today appreciated Dr Rashid when told by the minister that his recent remarks had led to the opposition demanding her resignation.

Dr Asad Majeed Khan, Pakistanâs new Ambassador to the United States, presented his credentials to US President Donald Trump at a ceremony held at the White House, a press release issued from the country's mission in Washington said on Saturday.

""Ambassador Khan conveyed the greetings of Pakistanâs leadership to President Trump who reciprocated with similar positive sentiments for Prime Minister Imran Khan,"" read the press release.

President Trump, according to the press release, said that he wants to explore opportunities for the two countries to work closely together and to renew their partnership.

The new envoy arrived in Washington earlier this week to take charge of the effort to renew once close relationship between the US and Pakistan.

Dr Majeed, until recently Pakistanâs ambassador in Tokyo, replaced Ali Jehangir Siddiqui who was appointed by the PML-N government days before its departure. Siddiqui held the position for more than seven months from May 9 to Dec 25, 2018 before being relieved of his duties by the incumbent PTI government.

Ambassador Majeed, who was also Pakistanâs deputy ambassador in Washington till 2015, is expected to revive Pakistani lobbies on the Hill that once played an effective role in promoting bilateral ties but have become ineffective due to internal disputes and lack of interest.

",1/12/2019,"Renowned fiction writer and novelist Khalida Hussain passed away on Friday due to complications from a long illness. She was in her 70s.

She had been suffering from various diseases after the tragic death of her only son and husband last year.

Her funeral prayer was held at a local mosque in G-8/2 which was attended by family members, friends and senior writers. The late writer was buried in H-9 graveyard after Asr prayers.

Ms Hussain was known as one of the best fiction writers and novelists in Urdu Literature. She rose to fame in the 60s with her short stories and became a trend setter. Kaghazi Ghat was her last masterpiece in Urdu literature.

Before marriage, she wrote under the name Khalida Asghar.

âKhalida Hussain was the best fiction writer in the country after Intizar Hussain. She always wrote stories on real life and introduced a new trend in Urdu fiction writing,â said poet Iftikhar Arif while talking to Dawn.

Mr Arif said Khalida Hussainâs death was a great loss to Urdu literature, adding that she was a serious writer who worked for women and literature.

âHer work depicted maturity and sensitivity. She focused on social issues and lives of people in her stories,â he said.

Mr Arif said he and Kishwar Naheed visited her just a few days ago.

âShe gave us her last book Kaghazi Ghat which is the best novel in modern times,â he said.

Famous writer Hameed Shahid, who had compiled her short stories, told Dawn that Ms Hussain stayed away from publicity.

âKhalida Hussain started her work with short stories that revolved around international crises and their implications on the lives of people,â he said.

She knew how to narrate stories which made it difficult for people to ignore, he added.

",1/12/2019,"AFTER the recent gas shortages across the country, the prime minister sacked the heads of the two distribution companies possibly in an attempt to appear in charge.

However, is such arbitrary sacking of senior officials accepted as a sign of a decisive person in charge â ie the prime minister â exercising executive authority? When you read an analysis of the decision such as the one in this newspaperâs leader on Friday, you form the opposite view.

A few lines from the editorial in a reminder of what it said:

Government officials and ministers can have no excuse for talking up a doomsday scenario and then blaming the media for causing panic.

âOn the face of it, assigning blame to the MDs of the gas distribution companies appears odd, given that they are not responsible for the production of gas or for its import. Besides, they neither draw up the merit order list nor do they decide how the pace of the expansion of gas demand is to be regulated. Their role is simply to run the gas distribution system. If there is a shortage of gas in the system, or if there is a technical outage at some point that is going to constrict the supply of gas, this information is available to authorities in the federal government in real time.

âAt least four officials in Islamabad, with offices very close to each other â the secretaries for power and petroleum as well as the ministers of these respective divisions â have in their offices screens displaying real-time data on how much gas is in the system, how the fields are functioning, how the distribution system is operating, and so on.

âWith all this readily available information, it is difficult to comprehend how blame was assigned to the very last link in the gas supply chain: the heads of the two distribution companies.â

This is a pertinent question. One can be assured there will be no honest answer apart from the one we suspect which, too, will remain unsaid: the need to do something drastic to take notice of the countrywide gas shortage. This was hardly the right thing to do.

The PTI government knows that it enjoys the full support of powerful state institutions and, therefore, it should feel no need to succumb to the temptation of such misplaced gestures and optics which can only demoralise professionals in key positions. It has the room to make mistakes, learn from them and carry on.

There are hints aplenty that the bureaucracy is now treading extremely cautiously, shying away from making decisions, having seen how some of the senior civil servants in the last government are being made to pay for both acts of omission and commission and even uncommitted sins.

The only answer to critics and to all the tentative cogs that make up the government is sure-footed decision-making. Only this creates an order where it is not the fear of recriminations but the pride in making the right decisions for the countryâs sake that is the primary motivating factor.

The fiasco of the appointment, or letâs say non-appointment, of the federal governmentâs spokesman on economy and energy has been discussed in these pages as elsewhere, particularly social media, exhaustively so it neednât be dwelt upon again but it remains a case in point.

And then, of course, there is the concern regarding the economy that was fuelled by PTI cabinet members when, on coming to power, they started painting a gloomy picture. If they are still in the opposition at least in psychological terms, they should rethink their ways.

Government members and ministers privy to all facts and figures can have no excuse for talking up a doomsday scenario and then blaming the media for running away with stories that caused panic among the people and in the markets.

From devaluation to the deficit, we have had a cacophony of ministerial voices saying contradictory things at different points over the past five months of the PTI government, and while it is easy to blame the media, there has been no attempt to speak with one credible voice on the economy.

From social media to TV talk shows, there is a dozen or so PTI senior members seemingly assigned to represent the governmentâs point of view but, despite talking a lot, they have disappointingly, for the government, not said much â at least in terms of offering a concrete defence of the governmentâs position in key areas where it is being subjected to questions and remains at the centre of concerns regarding the economy. What the government may consider is to prepare daily talking points or fact sheets with vital facts and figures that all ministers may use.

One can be sure Imran Khan is a central authority figure in his party and all his senior members and ministers gravitate towards him and are keen to toe his line. The clarity that is so far missing is in what that line may be in vital areas such as the economy and energy to name just two.

Over the medium to long term the government will sink or soar on the strength of its governance, the vision of its policy architects and the competence of its managers. As long as it has the support of state institutions it has no fear of being destabilised like some of the past governments.

Therefore, it is incumbent on it to focus on the way forward. Equally, it needs to clearly spell out its vision to the people. Only this can promote a widespread buy-in and generate confidence about the future.

197,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457096/how-and-when-did-pakistan-lose-its-mojo,"How and when did Pakistan lose its mojo?
",1/12/2019,"OLDER readers will recall that there was a time when Pakistan punched above its weight, and was taken seriously in international forums.

Now, our green passport is listed at fifth from the bottom by the Henley Passport Index that ranks the acceptability of passports by other countries that permit their holders entry on arrival. Thus, Japanese passports, at the top of the index, are accepted at the airports of 190 countries, while 33 nations extend a similar courtesy to Pakistani passports. Even this number seems a bit high, considering the hoops Pakistanis are made to jump through when applying for a visa to most countries.

So when did the slide to the bottom begin? And how and when did Pakistan lose its mojo? I addressed these questions in a column three years ago, and used cricket as a metaphor to capture our decline. But now as our team is getting thrashed by South Africa, while the Indian team has become the first team from South Asia to achieve a series win against Australia on its own turf, cricket will no longer serve as a metaphor.

So when did the slide to the bottom begin?

The harsh reality is that Pakistan is now regarded as a bankrupt country that mistreats its minorities and women, and is a violent, dangerous country to visit. The PTI government has been touting Pakistan as âan investment hubâ, but who are we trying to kid? The sight of Imran Khan travelling to friendly countries with begging bowl in hand is a national humiliation, although given fiscal realities, he really had no choice.

So why have things got so bad? Wars have consequences, and this is something past generals did not manage to grasp. The 1965 war over Kashmir under Ayub Khan, the 1971 war under Yahya Khan, and the absurd Kargil conflict unleashed by Musharraf all had one thing in common: they were led by generals who had seized power through coups.

Out of the three wars, the 1971 conflict with India has left the deepest scars, and not just because we lost on the battlefield. The bloody civil war and the widespread killing of Bengalis tarnished Pakistanâs image around the globe. This event was followed by decades of increasing levels of extremism that led to terrorism on a huge scale. Minorities and foreigners have been targeted, and the state and security personnel challenged as never before.

As a result, the abiding image of Pakistan abroad has been that of a breeding and training centre for jihadis. Although the security environment has improved considerably over the last year, many still see the country as ground zero for the global jihad. Every now and then, televised images of ferocious, bearded men holding the country to ransom are beamed around the world.

And with a population that has exploded to some 220 million, rampant poverty, widespread illiteracy and unpredictable policies, Pakistan is perceived as a nation on the brink. We may think this is an unfair picture, but like it or not, this is how the world sees us. And ever so often, cases like those of Malala Yousafzai and Asiya Bibi remind the world how women and minorities are treated.

Constant political upheavals have not helped in changing this perception. Elected governments have either been turfed out by the military establishment, or destabilised by ambitious rivals. A hyperactive judiciary has added to the political uncertainty.

With all these negative factors, the positive elements get overlooked. Above all, Pakistan is a very resilient country that has withstood a host of problems, many of them are of our own making. Futile wars, support for extremism, and a limitless appetite for loans to pay for our defence forces have pushed us into a corner.

Before 1971, our diplomats demanded â and received â âparityâ with India from foreign states. They were consulted by other Third World countries at the United Nations, and respected in the chanceries of global powers. Those days are long gone. Now they have the single-point agenda of Kashmir that they try to push with no success.

Indeed, the rest of the world is tired of the 70-year-old Kashmir problem, and even our closest friends no longer talk about implementing the old UN resolutions on the Valley. This may seem unfair, but who said life was fair? The reality is that India is a huge market, and its soft power gives it a clout few countries can match.

And our two-faced posture towards the Taliban in Afghanistan has served to lose us friends in the West, with Nato soldiers being killed and wounded by fighters who allegedly found shelter in our tribal areas. Small wonder our stock in Washington is the lowest it has been in decades.

",1/12/2019,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to give the residents of tribal districts relaxation in the age and qualification criteria for recruitment in its various departments.

Spokesman for the government Ajmal Wazir told reporters at the Chief Ministerâs House here on Friday that heads of all government departments had been directed to prepare lists showing their staff and equipment requirements.

He said sports activities would begin in tribal districts on Feb 10, while steps were also being taken to promote tourism there.

Spokesman says locals to get all basic facilities on priority basis

The spokesman said the government would consult the local residents on ways to boost local economy. He said the government was committed to bringing the merged districts on a par with developed ones.

Mr Wazir said both provincial and federal governments were serious about providing all basic facilities to the people of tribal districts on a priority basis to remove the prevailing sense of deprivation in the shortest possible time.

He said Chief Minister Mehmood Khan had already directed revenue officials to address the peopleâs problems in few months.

The spokesman said the health department had been told to take necessary steps without delay for establishing district headquarters hospitals in tribal districts and providing them with essential medicines and employees.

He said the government was making serious efforts to fulfil the needs of health centers, educational institutions and other departments in tribal districts by hiring employees on adhoc and contractual basis and even age and qualification relaxation would be given to the residents in those jobs.

Mr Wazir said the local residents would be recruited in government departments, including police.

He said the chief minister and other ministers had already visited merged districts on the advice of the prime minister to examine the existing facilities and prepare plans for their development.

The spokesman said the government would extend the independent monitoring unit to various districts to ensure the presence of staff in hospitals, schools and other departments so that the people could see a real change in the system.

He said a powerful committee headed by the chief secretary had been formed for the implementation of all government decisions in tribal districts.

Mr Wazir said the committee would thoroughly examine the activities of departments in the region and take necessary steps for their improvement.

He said the chief minister had visited Bajaur and Khyber districts and would visit other districts soon to learn about the residentsâ problems and order their resolution.

199,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456953/two-years-on-senates-directives-to-regulate-housing-societies-not-yet-enforced,"Two years on, Senateâs directives to regulate housing societies not yet enforced
",1/12/2019,"ISLAMABAD: Even after two-and-a-half years, the city managers have failed to properly implement the recommendations of the Senate to regulate housing societies.

In 2016, two reports compiled by the Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice had pointed fingers at the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the local administration for the mushroom growth of illegal housing schemes and the violation of layout plans by genuine cooperative housing societies.

The reports, which were adopted by the Senate in 2016 and by the CDA in March 2018, are yet to be properly implemented.

Two reports prepared by a standing committee in 2016 pointed fingers at CDA and capital administration for growth of housing societies

In one of the reports about the cooperative housing schemes, the Senate had recommended that the violations of layout plans committed by housing schemes may be accommodated by amending the regulations.

However, the house had directed the civic agencies that no compromise should be made regarding public parks.

After being informed that green areas and amenity plots had been sold out by housing societies, the Senate had recommended that any land adjacent to the housing schemes may be bought and utilised as public parks while space for graveyards should be acquired in the vicinities of the societies.

Two to three cooperative societies can also make joint ventures for providing and maintaining such a space. The report also said alternative sites should be given for public buildings.

The Senate had also directed that the role of the CDA and capital administration officers and officials in the mushroom growth of illegal housing societies should be identified.

The CDA was also recommended to acquire land for the development of sectors and get land in Zone 3 for the Margalla Hills National Park.

However, the sources said, the recommendations of the upper house of parliament were not properly implemented.

When contacted, CDA spokesman Syed Safdar Ali claimed that the civic agency had been implementing the recommendations.

âNothing is pending on our part and approval will be processed once formalities are completed. During the last four year, no scheme has been approved formally as documentation is not completed by sponsors,â he said.

But sources said the level of violations made by housing societies was so enormous that in many cases it was practically not possible for them to comply with the recommendations.

For example, they added, it was recommended that land adjacent to a housing society which violated its layout plan should be bought by the same society to provide public parks and graveyards.

âIn the surrounding of many societies, no unutilised land is available,â said the sources.

Meanwhile, in a related development, the civic agency issued notices to 13 housing societies for the recovery of Rs1.5 billion pending against them in terms of excess charges, extension of development period, changes in approved layout plans and development without obtaining no-objection certificates.

According to CDA documents, Cabinet Division Society has to pay Rs181 million, Engineersâ Society Rs71 million, Khayaban-i-Kashmir-I Rs261m, Margalla View Rs93m, Ministry of Interior Housing Society Rs94m, Multi Gardens-I, Rs337m, Tele Gardens Rs83m, Zarkoon Heights Rs16m, Bahria Town Phase-7 Rs3.8m, Capital Enclave Rs41m, CBR Town Rs34m, Gulberg Town Rs34m and Jinnah Town Rs91m.

Officials said the CDA on and off took action against housing societies which had got layout plans approved or had NOCs but there were over 100 totally illegal housing societies against whom no proper action was taken on time. In most of such societies, their operators have sold out plots to the citizens.

They said in such schemes on the directions of the CDA now utility connections were not being provided to the residents.

The CDA spokesman said action was being taken against both illegal housing societies and those that had deficiencies in their layout plans.

",1/12/2019,"LAHORE: Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar said on Friday he laid the foundation of judicial activism in the country with full bona fide.

âThis judicial activism was never meant to interfere in the jurisdiction of other institutions or to humiliate anyone,â Justice Nisar said at a farewell dinner by the Lahore High Court Bar Association. âIt was not an aggression.â

Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar: Herald Person of the Year 2019

Chief Justice of Pakistan-designate Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan and other judges were also present.

Justice Nisar said he always kept in mind the constitutional limits of the judiciary and other institutions. The sole purpose of his visits to hospitals was to ensure correct utilisation of government resources.

The chief justice said he would have made mistakes intentionally or unintentionally but whatever he did was for the rule of law only. He reiterated that he never tried to disgrace anyone.

Sharing his experience of holding open courts, the chief justice said he met people in public hospitals having no money to buy medicines.

He regretted that the people were not getting justice in time in courts. âWe also miss quality of arguments by lawyers in the courts nowadays,â added the chief justice. He advised the judges of district judiciary to do their work like a passion, and not a job.

The chief justice said he witnessed top lawyers of their time like Ijaz Batalvi and SM Zafar advancing arguments in courts well before joining the legal profession. âMy association with Lahore High Court is 56-year-old as I used to visit this premises with my father during my school days,â he said.

âMy whole life, I tried to become a fair judge as it carries a great reward in life after death.â

He urged lawyers to do hard work as they were part and parcel of the judicial system. He lamented that petitions being filed under section 22-A of Cr.P.C (against non registration of FIR) had hijacked the courts. He said the judges were not supposed to ensure registration of cases.

He pointed out that a police reform package was going to be introduced on Jan 14 in Islamabad with the support of the law and justice commission.

Chief Justice Nisar told the bar with a pride that Supreme Judicial Council had decided all the pending references against the judges and was left with two only. The judiciary was holding its accountability on merit, the chief justice added and urged the lawyers to also put their house in order.

",1/12/2019,"LAHORE: Scores of shopkeepers launched a massive protest by blocking the main road after an elderly fruit seller died of a cardiac arrest during an anti-encroachment operation in the Multan Road (Chungi) vegetable and fruit market on Friday.

The shopkeepers also besieged the encroachment team head (city assistant commissioner), forcing the officials to leave the area. They refused to lift the body of 60-year-old Sharif from the road and end the protest till registration of criminal cases against all those conducting the anti-encroachment operation.

Read: No injustice to be done during anti-encroachment drive: PM

âWe will neither remove the body of Sharif nor will we end the protest until registration of cases on murder charges against the officials who launched the operation,â Qaisar, a vendor, told Dawn.

âWhat this government wants to do with us... it seems it wants to kill the poor people,â he deplored.

The city administration had decided a couple of days ago to launch operations in cityâs five vegetable & fruit markets including the one on Multan Road (Mandi stop) near Mansoora. A team comprising city and respective zonal / town officials and led by AC (City) Ahmad Raza Butt removed 300 temporarily built shops in the market and arrested four people for protesting and offering resistance.

The teams even crushed fruits and vegetables under the wheels of the tractors.

âSome officials manhandled the vendors including Sharif who collapsed and died on the spot,â alleged a vendor.

AC Ahmad Raza Butt told Dawn the operation was carried out in the light of instructions issued by the agriculture department.

âThis market was turned into a non-formal set-up as no auction had been done for a long time. Those who had been allotted shops had left the businesses and these were being used for other purposes such as workshops. Many people had illegally occupied various spaces and the operation was meant to remove such encroachments / businesses and revive the market,â he claimed.

He denied that the vendor died due to manhandling. In fact, the vendors were selling fruits / vegetables in a street leading to the market and the operation was carried out only inside the market, he said.

âWhenever such operations are carried out, the vendors start fleeing with their wheel carts. So the vendor might have suffered a heart attack in a bid to hastily move away,â he said.

The protesters held talks with the senior officials including the SP (city) and demanded that the Chief Justice of Pakistan take notice of the situation.

âWe appeal to the CJP to take suo motu notice and order registration of cases against the officials,â a protester demanded.

203,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456933/a-variety-of-flavours-on-offer-at-karachi-eat-festival-2019,"A variety of flavours on offer at Karachi Eat Festival 2019
",1/12/2019,"KARACHI: The Karachi Eat Festival (KEF), despite competition from several other smaller festivals held in the city, enjoys a cult-like status and on Friday, the eventâs opening day, Karachiites thronged the Beach Park in Clifton to partake in the latest culinary offerings that aim to push the traditional boundaries of fast food and gourmet meals.

âWith around 95 food stalls this year, almost 56 are of home cooks, or budding âfoodpreneursâ, who donât have restaurants of their own, who are the real gems of the festival,â says Omar Omari of CKO Event Architecture, the organisers of the festival.

There are many success stories that have come out from the KEF. Wingitt, Desi Gali, Jucy Lucy all started off as stalls at the KEF and ventured out and became big businesses. Babamoo is one such success story that has emerged from the KEF and has made a name in Karachiâs culinary world.

âKarachi is an audience hungry for innovation in the area of foodâ

Run by brothers Ibad and Nabil, along with two other partners, the Babamoo stall was in full swing on the first day as the orders had already started rolling in moments after the KEF was officially open. âWhen we first took part in last yearâs KEF we wanted to launch an item that hadnât been introduced to foodies in Karachi before â the jacket potato and innovative toppings. To be honest we had not expected it to sell much as it was a niche product. However, the outcome and feedback we got was tremendous. Within five hours we had sold off the stock we had planned for three days.â

The brothers opened up their first restaurant in March. Nabil is of the opinion that âKarachi is an audience hungry for innovation in the area of food and the KEF is an essential place that provides a platform to budding foodpreneurs.â

Tayyaba Gulâs patisserie tucked away in one corner at the KEF is another such home-based venture that is introducing to the Karachi audience flavours from France. A graduate of Le Cordon Bleu, she returned to Pakistan almost two years ago and established Le Saint HonorÃ© PÃ¢tisserie, which focuses entirely on French desserts. Her signature offering are smaller versions of the St. HonorÃ© cake, also known as St. Honoratus cake, which is a pastry named for the French patron saint of bakers and pastry chefs.

According to Omari, the design philosophy behind KEF is to make the festival look premium but making it accessible to everybody. This allows those from all walks of life access to a shared space at the same time, and on Friday the KEF seemed to have successfully accomplished this vision.

A parking map, event layout and stalls list is provided on the Facebook page of the festival. The KEF 2019 will continue on Saturday and Sunday, from 12.30pm to 10.30pm.

",1/12/2019,"KARACHI: On the 109th day of their sit-in outside the Karachi Press Club and following a protest rally they had staged a day earlier, the 1,751 dock workers of Port Qasim Authority were paid their long overdue salaries on Friday.

It was a sigh of relief for the workers, who were paid five monthsâ salaries, from July 18 to November 18, through two cheques of a total amount of Rs20.547 million after a meeting between representatives of Huaneng Fuyun Port and Shipping (HFPS), which handles berths three and four at Port Qasim, and representatives of the workers, social workers, human rights activists and trade unionists.

The cheques were handed over by Chen Long, executive director of the HFPS, to Hussain Badshah, the secretary general of the Workers Union of Port Qasim. Nasir Mansoor of the National Trade Union Federation, as the convener of the Workers Action Committee for Dock Workers, was also present.

He and Karamat Ali of the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research congratulated the workers for successfully holding their ground by carrying a peaceful protest for so long and for finally seeing their demands met by their employers. âWe are extremely happy for the poor dock workers and their families,â Karamat Ali told Dawn.

The workers are now to be paid only their December salaries and they have also been asked to fulfil certain recruitment requirements by their Chinese employers in the contracts offered to them.

",1/12/2019,"KARACHI: Opposition members in the Sindh Assembly, barring two minor parties, on Friday walked out of the house, accusing the deputy speaker of âbulldozingâ their business and showering âundueâ favours upon the treasury benches.

The treasury benches, on the other hand, said members of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and the Grand Democratic Alliance â which collectively formed the combined opposition in the assembly â left the house on âbaselessâ issues having nothing to do with the betterment of their constituents.

Initially, the MQM and the GDA joined the PTI to march out of the house when all of them accused Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari, who was presiding over the proceedings, of not allowing them to ask supplementary questions during Question Hour.

IT minister says steps being taken to install 10,000 security cameras in Karachi

With the opposition â barring Muttahida Majlis-i-Amalâs Abdul Rasheed and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistanâs Mohammad Qasim â out of the house, there was smooth sailing for the treasury benches, which took advantage of the conditions and concluded Question Hour early.

All the five calling-attention notices were filed by the opposition members and none of them could be taken up as the movers were absent.

Similarly, a privilege motion filed by MQM-Pâs Mohammad Hussain could also not be taken up. However, as soon as the house was tackling other business, Mr Hussain returned along with some other colleagues and GDAâs Nand Kumar.

He demanded the chair to go back to the dayâs agenda and allow him to move his privilege motion.

The chair said the time for the motion had lapsed.

Mr Hussainâs certain words were inaudible to the galleries. However, Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani requested the chair that his words be expunged.

The MQM-P lawmaker later stayed for a while in front of the chair and warned: âNow, weâll tell how the house is run.â

Later, he fired a broadside at the chair along with PTIâs parliamentary party leader Haleem Shaikh as both accused her of forming âa dictatorshipâ.

The bitterness in the house emerged during Question Hour when Information Technology Minister Taimur Talpur was criticised, first by PTIâs Khurram Sher Zaman and then by GDAâs Mustafa Jatoi while the former was responding to queries.

Both sides exchanged personal remarks directed against each other.

Spelling bee?

Mr Jatoi insisted that the minister should spell out the word âscienceâ. His assertion was regarded as non-serious for a parliamentarian by the treasury benches.

Soon, the opposition benches rose and protested when the chair jumped to the next question when, as opposition members insisted, they were yet to ask supplementary questions.

Ms Leghari said the opposition members could ask those supplementary questions in the next question as well. However, the opposition members did not accept her suggestion.

Leader of the Opposition Firdous Naqvi walked out from the house and others from his party, the MQM-P and the GDA followed him. Minister Ghani said the oppositionâs attitude was âimmatureâ, which instead of focusing on core issues was only confined to playing to the galleries.

Old and obsolete curriculum

Later, MMAâs Rasheed, on a point of order, pointed out âthousands of errors and mistakesâ in the school textbooks.

He said the education department should rectify those mistakes as some of them were grave.

Education Minister Sardar Shah admitted that the curriculum was old and obsolete, which merited to be changed at the earliest. He said the syllabus was last reviewed in 2006. His ministry had held a meeting of the curriculum board last year and efforts were being made to revise and improve it.

âI totally agree with the memberâs view. I have personally seen more mistakes and errors in the textbooks than Mr Rasheed,â said Mr Shah.

He said order for the current yearâs textbooks had already been placed and if they had not been published yet, they would be revised on priority.

He said he had set a deadline for 2020 to revise the entire curricula.

To another assertion by Mr Rasheed about reduction of seats in the Benazir Bhutto Medical College Lyari, Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said the issue belonged to the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, which regulates and decides the ratios of seats in medical colleges and universities.

She said the issue was not in the hand of her ministry to reduce or increase the seats.

About the nursing institute, she had ordered an inquiry into maladministration in the institute.

GDAâs Nand Kumar demanded early recovery of kidnapped Sukkur trader Ramesh Kumar.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Chawla said the provincial governmentâs efforts had reduced kidnappings for ransom and efforts for Mr Kumarâs recovery were already in full swing.

TLPâs Mohammad Qasim condemned the federal government for resorting to âvictimisationâ of opponents. He said the arrest of his partyâs leader was against the Constitution.

The house fixed the debate on an adjournment motion moved by Heer Soho regarding âfailure and apathyâ of the Indus River System Authority in sanctioning Sindhâs due share of water on Wednesday.

The Sindh Zakat and Ushr (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was passed unanimously.

Plan to install 10,000 cameras in Karachi

In Question Hour, the house was informed that a consultant had been hired to prepare a feasibility report and PC-I of the project of installation of 10,000 cameras in the city.

Answering a question, Information, Science and Technology Minister Talpur said that the project of installation of cameras in the city was initiated by the home department on the orders of the Supreme Court.

He said that process of hiring the consultant was under way.

To another question, the minister said that the provincial government did not earn any revenue from the installation of mobile phone towers as the matter was under the domain of the federal government and did not pertain to the provincial information, science and technology department.

In reply to a question, the minister said that as many as 39 websites were being maintained by different provincial government departments.

Besides, he said that there was no IT training centre at district level.

",1/12/2019,"ISLAMABAD: A law suit has been filed against former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and his driver, Abid Nawaz, over the death of a police constable in a road accident last year.

The plaintiff, Aurangzeb Abbasi, who filed the suit under âFatal Accident Act, 1855â, sought over Rs20 million in compensation from the ex-premier and his driver over the death of his son, police constable Zeeshan Abbasi, in the road accident.

According to the application, âon September 22, 2018 when Zeeshan was coming from Islamabad to Faizabad, Rawalpindi on his personal bike (RIN-737), a land cruiser (GU-027) rashly and negligently driven by defendant no 2 [Nawaz] hit him from back. As a result of this accident, Zeeshan was badly [injured and] died on the spot.â

It said the driver was arrested but was granted bail. Since the former prime minister was the owner of the vehicle, he was also responsible for the fatal accident, the plaintiff argued.

",1/12/2019,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and the Majlis-i-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) have formed a joint coordination committee to explore prospects for collaboration aimed at realising common goals and objectives.

The six-member coordination committee has been established with the consent of PTI chief and Prime Minister Imran Khan and MWM chief Allama Nasir Abbas.

The committee will consist of three members each from the two parties.

The PTI members will be Naeemul Haq, adviser to the PM on political affairs, Ijaz Chaudhary, central deputy secretary general, and Syed Ali Zaidi, federal minister for maritime affairs.

Syed Nasir Abbas Sheerazi, Syed Asad Abbas Naqvi and Syed Mohsin Shehryar will represent the MWM.

The MWM and PTI developed working relations during the 2014 sit-in against the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

The MWM had raised its voice against the Model Town operation in June of the same year by the Punjab government in which 14 workers of Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Allama Tahir ul Qadri, lost their lives.

The MWM had joined the sit-in in support of PAT, but it did not take long for the party to make an impression on Tehreek-i-Insaf and its leader, Imran Khan, thanks to its disciplined workers who stood their ground in the face of clashes with police and harsh weather.

The two parties had an electoral understanding for last yearâs general election, enabling an MWM candidate to make it to the Punjab Assembly.

Talking to Dawn, a member of the coordination committee said the body would try to find elements common to the two partiesâ election manifestoes and work out a plan for their implementation.

Among the key issues highlighted by the MWM and already taken up by the PTI-led government were resolution of problems faced by pilgrims at Taftan border with Iran and measures for their security on the QuettaâTaftan road.

",1/12/2019,"QUETTA: The federal government has assured the Balochistan government that it would be taken on board while taking decisions on exploration and development of natural resources and it would be given share from the resources.

The decision was taken in a meeting on Friday which was attended by Chief Minister of Balochistan Jam Kamal Khan Alyani, FedÂ­eral Minister for Petroleum Ghulam Sarwar Khan and other concerned authorities.

Moreover, the meeting decided to set up a joint working group comprising federal and provincial authorities which would take decisions on exploration and development of natural resources in the province.

The joint working group, besides protecting the rights of Balochistan, will also decide other issues such Sui mining lease, licencing zones, 18th Constitutional Amendment, Petroleum Policy and article 172 (3) and 158 of the Constitution. The meeting agreed on removing reservations of Balochistan and asked the working group to submit its report within a month.

Provincial ministers Mir Saleem Khan Khosa, Mir Zia Langove, Engineer Zamarak Khan Piralizai, Mir Omer Khan Jamali, Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi, Noor Muhammad Dummar, Deputy Speaker of the Balochistan Assembly Sardar Babar Khan Musakhail and senior concerned officials of ministry of petroleum and Balochistan government attended the meeting.

Participants also discussed extension in Sui mining lease, petroleum policy, powers of the provincial government, issuance of licences for mining and exploration in mineral rich areas, agreement signing with exploration companies, the provinceâs share in mineral-related income, installation of LPG plants and extension of Saindak projectâs mining area.

Furthermore, the meeting deliberated on exploration and development of mineral resources in Block 28, gas pressure, reduction in gas rates and the issues of Pakistan Mineral and Development Corporation, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd and gas distribution companies, and generation of employment opportunities and economic activities by the companies involved in mining and exploration.

Jam Kamal, while referring to coalition of the Balochistan Awami Party and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at federal and provincial level, said that the two coalition partners would set a precedent of bilateral cooperation.

âWe have witnessed high-level meetings in the past but didnât see implementation of decision but now there should be progress on all decision because the centre is responsible to take all provinces together.â He stressed upon quick installation of LPG plants in the province.

Endorsing Jam Kamalâs stance, Ghulam Sarwar Khan said the OGDCL and PPL must prepare for the partnership with the provincial government in exploration of mineral and gas projects. He pledged to protect the rights of the province.

384,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1813087/6-asad-umar-checks-pakistan-financial-rehab-clinic/,Asad Umar checks Pakistan into a financial rehab clinic,9/28/2018,"One cannot expect a drug addict to find a job before he reformÂ­s his behaviÂ­our

Heroin is to drug addicts what foreign exchange (read dollars) is to Pakistanâs economy right now. When a drug addict enters a rehabilitation clinic, he often perceives the doctor as the enemy, stripping away the addictâs ability to experience joy in life. Asad Umar is in a similar position with the Pakistani people, as he weans us off debt and expensive imports. In this case, like the addict, itâs easier for us to fight the doctor instead of the disease. The irony is that the doctor only has one goal at heart: to make the patient feel better and live life to its fullest.

Asad Umar has emerged from whatever rock or container he was hiding under by presenting the mini-budget last week. His silence on a substantive economic policy in the first few days of government was confusing because heâs never been short of opinions while in the opposition. But it seems like Asad has taken the first few weeks in government to digest the enormity of economic challenges in front of him. Let us assume Pakistan is a family with 100 rupees of expenditure every month. We spend around 36 rupees on interest payments and another 18 rupees on defence. Our monthly income is around 80 rupees so we still borrow 20 rupees a month to make ends meet.

Asadâs mini-budget attempts to be pro-poor, pro-exporters (read industrialists) and tries to bring down the import bill in this challenging fiscal landscape. Yes, it hurts to have income taxes raised but the lowest income workers have been protected (and should continue to be protected by reducing indirect taxes). Gas and electricity prices have also been raised independent of the budget. While all of this sounds like Purana Pakistan, itâs actually good for the country. Asad has a thankless job at the moment but heâs doing the right thing. Much like a doctor forcing a drug addict to kick the habit, the next few months will be painful but Asad has taken the courageous way forward versus giving in to knee-jerk populist policies.

The only place where Asad deserves across-the-board criticism is for allowing non-filers to purchase real estate and cars. This is a step backwards and signals potential capture of the government by vested interests. The apparent reason â allowing overseas Pakistanis to make purchases â could have had other workarounds (hello NICOP). The energy and excitement going into raising funds for dams could have been channelled into getting Pakistanis to file taxes so we donât have to beg every time the government needs money. For the first time, arguably in Pakistanâs history, people actually trust the government with their tax money. Now would be the time for a fresh start and encouraging people to pay and file taxes. The only way to break free from debt is to live within our means. Going to China or Saudi Arabia to avoid the IMF doesnât cure our debt problem, it only masks the symptoms long enough for the problem to get worse.

The other critique of Asad Umarâs economic announcements has been how uninspiring and inside the box itâs been. This is true but partly unfair because of the state of the economy he inherited. One cannot expect a drug addict to find a job before he reforms his behaviour. Itâs like saying a drug addict should just flip a switch and turn around his life. Itâs not that easy.

Incredible, short-term pain is about to hit the Pakistani public if we want to get our finances in order and chart a path for growth. Subsidies on utilities will have to be eliminated slowly. A culture of tax paying will have to be nurtured. Jobs will have to be lost at public-sector companies to manage their haemorrhaging budgets. Once these interventions are made, we can move faster on our path to growth. The problem with Pakistanâs finances is that we always come to the brink and get saved by someone. If the drug addict is always rescued by family and never has his rock bottom moment of vomiting on the toilet floor trying to flush out his over- dose, the desire to change doesnât come from within. The desire for change becomes circumstantial.

Itâs important for leaders like Imran and Asad, who have the political and moral capital of being âcleanâ, to nurture a desire for genuine economic change in the country that is painful but worthwhile. If they donât take the time to explain this to the Pakistani public, their reform plan will not have the political capital to sustain itself. Itâs time to flush the addiction to debt and living beyond our means from Pakistan. That is the only path to foreign policy independence and sustainable economic growth.

NEW YORK: Sacha Baron Cohen is back and Sarah Palin is not amused. The US former vice presidential nominee and ex-Alaska governor has launched an extraordinary attack on the British comedian for duping her to take part in his new show.

âYaâ got me, Sacha. Feel better now?â wrote the mother of five, once synonymous with the Tea Party movement on the far-right of the Republican Party.

Cohen, she said, âheavily disguised himself as a disabled US veteran, fake wheelchair and all,â for the interview that she was told was a âlegitâ historical documentary by pay-to-view American television network Showtime.

Sarah Palin says she doesnât get sexually harassed because she carries a gun

âI join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick âhumorâ of the British âcomedianâ Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime,â she wrote.

Palin said she ultimately walked out of the interview and slammed what she called the Cambridge-educated comedianâs âforeign commentariesâ that disrespected the US military and middle-class Americans.

She called on Cohen, CBS and Showtime to donate all proceeds from the interview to charities that support American veterans.

In a final indignity, Palin accused the production team of âpurposefullyâ dropping her and her daughter off at the wrong Washington airport, âknowingâ they would miss their return flights back to Alaska.

Cohen first found fame in Britain in 2000 with âDa Ali G Showâ that saw his wannabe rapper character interview unsuspecting public figures. The show later transferred across the Atlantic.

Sarah Palin endorses âmasterâ dealmaker Trump for US president

He followed a similar format with hit movie characters that include bumbling Kazakh reporter Borat and gay Austrian fashionista Bruno.

His latest venture âWho is America?â is a satirical half-hour seven-episode series that premieres this Sunday on Showtime.

KARACHI : Satire is the use of humour and ridicule to expose peopleâs flaws in the context of socio-politics and other contemporary issues. Add to it the fact that an artist using satire to talk about a societyâs deep-rooted issues must have something intelligent to say and show them the mirror in a careful manner.

Veteran humourist and writer Anwar Maqsood released the latest episode of his online series titled Anwarnama on April 22 and it intended to be a satire on Sindhis. Titled Aik Sindhi Ka Interview, it shows Anwar reading a skit featuring him and a âcommon Sindhiâ.

In an attempt to be funny, the episode starts off with the interviewer asking the Sindhi what he does for a living and he responds, âNothing, I donât need to work because I am Sindhi.â It then describes how the Sindhi man enjoys living a lavish lifestyle, indulges in various vices and in theory, dies multiple times in order to avoid paying off debt.

The episode irked the entire Sindhi population, here and abroad and caused a massive online backlash. Although it has now been removed from social media after Anwar publicly apologised, it merely goes on to show peopleâs attitude towards the Sindhi community.

Aik Sindhi Ka Interview comes off as offensive just for the sake of being offensive and it isnât the least bit funny. The veteran had nothing important and intelligent to say and did not look at people in a critical manner but relegated to, intentionally or not, reinforce the stereotypes about Sindhis that have been consistent in Pakistani entertainment and media for years. This is the lowest common denominator of humour one didnât expect from a legend like Anwar.

Talking to The Express Tribune, The Sketches front man Saif Samejo revealed that Anwar and Moin Akhtar had always been offensive, even back in the days of Loose Talk. âThey had episodes where Akhtar appeared as a Bengali or Pashtun. Itâs nothing new and I have been speaking out about this for years but no one cares,â he said. âOur media and films always showed a bandit wearing an ajrak, which is a sign of ultimate respect in our culture. Sindhis even welcomed immigrants during the time of Partition with an ajrak. Diversity is the strength of Sindh, which is the only diverse region in Pakistan.â

Iâm 75 now. I want to retire: Anwar Maqsood

Saif continued, âI watched this recent episode and I donât understand how one can call Sindhis jahil when you live in Sindh. You sit alongside him and a Sindhi accepts you as part of the community. Sindhi is not just a government worker or a certain political party supporter, he is also Sachal, he is also Bhittai. Sindh is also the land which welcomes everyone whether Christian, Hindu or anyone else.â He added that Anwar had a substandard mentality and that he was still caged in that old mindset. âYou are in Sindh now and you are Sindhi too,â Saif retorted.

Comedian Ali Gul Pir reiterated that Loose Talk had a lot of controversial episodes. âBut there was no sensitivity back then. Now itâs different. He doesnât narrow it down to a government worker or anyone but generalises and says âaik Sindhiâ. When the first joke you make is that heâs lazy, you are clearly reinforcing a stereotype,â he said. âWhen I made Wadere ka Beta, it was centered on Sindhi wadera, not all Sindhis. It was made clear. If there is a wadera villain in a film, itâs not racist because every story needs certain characters. The point is that distinction be made and there should be no generalisation.â

Ali mentioned he could find lazy people everywhere and not only in Sindh. âThere is a way to go about criticising society or people. But what concerns me is that nobody else in his team saw the problem in this video. Why should a renowned artist reinforce the same stereotypical ideas and divide people when we are going past the ethnic and sectarian conflicts here.â

TV personality and politician Mahtab Akbar Rashdi criticised the timing of the videoâs release. âMaqsood is an intellectual satirist and has a way of looking at things. But now at this juncture we are getting sensitive about so many things, about culture, language, etc and we are intolerant about so many things, and taking everything personally. In this scenario, releasing this video shows insensitivity,â she said. âPeople are taking it seriously and Maqsood should know that people are sensitive about certain things regarding the land of Sindh. Itâs not intolerance but because of love for their land. Sindhis canât compromise about anyone talking about Sindh. When it comes to their culture, land and water, there is no compromise.â

Mahtab continued, âThis could have been easily ignored but not at this time. I know he makes fun of everyone but this is just rubbing salt in someoneâs eyes. Not every Sindhi acts like he showed. You are targeting an entire nation of people. Itâs not humor, its humiliation.â

Anwar Maqsoodâs âSiachenâ: Mastermind Dawar Mehmood is back â this time with Sajid Hasan

Director Institute of Sindhology Dr Ishaq Samejo said it showed a biased and narrow-minded view of people. âThis video isnât only against Sindhis, but also Urdu-speaking community. Itâs just trying to create a divide between us and this attitude is condemnable,â he said. âSindhis have always been welcoming and loving towards others. For me, Maqsood hasnât only diminished his status as a writer but also a human.â Ishaq called the episode âa third-rate satire, if it can be called satire at all,â and said that one of the founding fathers and statesman Liaquat Ali Khan initiated this attitude, which has now become a mindset. âHe called Sindhi culture that of donkey-carts and the language of illiterates and uneducated. This is the privileged class whose attitude has prevailed for so long and is not acceptable.â

Director Benazir Bhutto Chair at University of Karachi, Sahar Gul, likened this attitude to a form of narcissism. âItâs a form of narcissism that my language, sect or culture is supreme. It leads to curbing of diversity and the last stage is that if youâre not like me, you should be killed. If he (Maqsood) had used the word Sindhi wadera, it could have been tolerated.â She said, âWe are proud of our rural areas where agriculture is a big part of our country and our people. This is a social responsibility of the literati they should condemn the killers of the community, and remove bias from the community. But they donât do this.â

Initially defending the video, Anwar said he had lived in Sindh since he came in 1948 and he respected all the greats and even knew some personally. In the video, he is seen holding a copy of Shah Jo Risalo and apologising to everyone for hurting their sentiments. âIt worried me that I hurt peopleâs sentiments. I donât belong to any political party and I knew Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari. Sindh is a land of love, where Sachal and Bhittai lived,â he said. âI apologise to everyone that my humour hurt my Sindhi brothersâ sentiments.â

Anwar Maqsood is a bigger and better writer than Woody Allen: Sajid Hasan

Anwarâs timely apology must be appreciated as he realised and retracted the video to fix the mistake. But the larger picture shows that the cause of concern isnât only this video but that this attitude towards the Sindhi community has been going on for years. Comedy has been used to reflect on society for so long and it has the right to be offensive but only when it has something of value to say. I would personally be on board if Anwarâs piece was at least funny and painted a true picture of a common Sindhi or had done away with generalising the entire community. Itâs like making a stereotypical Pathan joke. In this day and age, itâs not only unfunny, but rather crude and perhaps only has a place in local stage shows which feed on this low-taste comedy. It isnât something one would expect from someone with a stature that Anwar enjoys.

Times are changing and today, even the slightest error can mount up to be a bigger issue. This small negligence, which could have been easily avoided on part of the veteran humourist, exposed the plethora of issues concerning stereotypical representation of Sindhis in local media.

Go out of our comfort zone and you realise, just like in every nation, there are people who are good, motivated, hardworking as well as lazy and corrupt. As Saif pointed out on Twitter that it wasnât only about Anwar or Akhtar but about the venomous mindset that is prevalent. âSince we grew up, we have been seeing such a wrong image (of Sindhis) and every age has to prove that we arenât like what you portray us to be. Pakistan needs to revisit Sindh and feel (and understand) what âSindhyatâ really is.â

387,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1632147/1-making-sense-times-reality-stranger-satire/,Making sense of the times: Is reality stranger than satire?,2/12/2018,"In a world where realitÂ­y competÂ­es with satire, paneliÂ­sts at KLF try to make sense of it all

KARACHI: We are living in a time when reality seems to be in competition with satire â decimating the benchmark of what we hold true.

In a world of Trump and the Onion, it is tough to distinguish between truth and satire â sometime even a disclaimer fails to do the job. In a bid to find validation for their theories, people are open to believing everything they see and hear. The number of likes has become equivalent to proof of authenticity.

#MeToo talk pushes aside issue of harassment

So how does one follow? A panel comprising Zarrar Khuhro and Fasi Zaka discussed the phenomena in a session titled âReality Catches up with Satireâ, moderated by Nadeem Farooq Paracha at the ninth Karachi Literature Festival on Saturday.

âItâs impossible to keep up, reality has taken over satire,â Khuhro said. âWe have to lower our standards of comedy to keep up with reality.â

When an audience member recalled the statement of Pakistan Peoples Party Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari vowing to bring back stolen money, Zarrar quipped, âThis is genius! How do you top that?â

Highlighting a major problem with satire today, Zaka said we are now punching down at victims instead of punching up at the powerful. He explained that in the 1980s the target was General Ziaul Haq but today it was protesters at Faizabad.

âWe have a base of people who largely agree with us,â he said. âWe believe we are converting the other side but you cannot convert people by making fun of them.â

Paracha wondered whether gullibility was becoming the norm today. Khuhroâs opinion seemed to differ as he pointed out that opinions which were once confined to drawing rooms have been provided a public platform through social media. âPeople have always been the same; we were never patient.â

He argued that it was not an anomaly to say or do things that made little sense when you are young. The only difference is that there is no permanent record of us being âstupidâ on a public platform, he said.

Universities â a breeding ground for terrorists?

Speaking to The Express Tribune about the repercussions of using sarcasm to weigh in on issues, Khuhro said, âThe speed at which your views are disseminated is much faster now â an ordinary person using Twitter can potentially reach an audience of millions, hence the backlash is magnified.â

The creeping self-censorship in the age of outrage has curtailed our ability to take on the ironies of today. Zaka believes most satirists are not doing their job to the fullest. âWe have internalised some of the censorship rules,â he told The Express Tribune. âThe satire we do is punching at the sanctioned people or institutions that we can make fun of, which usually serves a purpose of other institutions who are actually acting in fairly undemocratic fashion.â

Zaka was of the view that it was not the thought of offending the masses that was responsible for self-censorship, rather it was âthe systematic state actionsâ against those using satire to depict reality that sent a strong signal. âYou may like it or not but it [the work] was nowhere in the realm of treason,â he said.

LONDON: British satirist Armando Iannucci has won critical praise in Britain for his latest film â a darkly comic look at the power struggle to succeed Joseph Stalin â but in Russia not all politicians share the joke.

One communist politican branded it âabominable filth.â âThe Death of Stalin,â which stars Steve Buscemi, Jeffrey Tambor and Jason Isaacs, held its UK premiere on Tuesday night. As the title suggests, it features a scene depicting the Soviet dictatorâs demise in 1953.

Russia invited to explore untapped Pakistan market

âThe comedy is about whatâs going on inside the Kremlin, the power struggle, you know, the frantic kind of fight for survival really,â Iannucci told Reuters.

âThatâs where the comedy comes and the paranoia thatâs going on as well. But the consequences of these peopleâs actions is what ripples out across the Soviet Union â we show that for real.â

There has been no comment from the Kremlin about the film. But communist members of the Russian parliament are calling for a ban on its release in Russia. Russian Communist party spokesperson Alexander Yushchenko, himself a parliamentarian, described the film as âabominable filth,â in an interview cited by the partyâs website.

âTodayâs support â including for Stalin and (state founder Vladimir) Lenin â is on the rise, first and foremost among young people,â he said. The film as yet does not have a Russian release date listed on the film industry website IMDB.com.

Russia supplying free fuel to Taliban in war against NATO forces, reveals report

Sergei Obukhov, another senior member of the Russian communist party, drew a similar conclusion saying the film was âa new form of psychological warfare against our country.â Stalin ruled Russia for three decades during which he is widely held responsible for the deaths of millions of people, many in the Gulag network of labour camps.

The image of the dictator appears to be going through something of a rehabilitation in Russia though. A poll by the Russiaâs Levada Centre in June found that respondents considered Stalin the âmost outstanding personâ in history, followed by present-day president, Vladimir Putin. Iannucci has won dozens of awards for his foul-mouthed political comedies âThe Thick Of Itâ and âVeepâ, which centre on dysfunctional politicians in Britain and the United States

respectively.

Egyptian comedian, Bassem Youssef, has created a way to combat Islamophobia for Muslims across America called the âMuslim morning after kitâ, reported Huffington Post.

Youssef, who is also termed âEgyptian Jon Stewartâ is a terrific satirist, and he teamed up with entertainment site CAFÃ to bring Muslims the perfect gateway to protection against suspicion and discrimination. The kit is an innovative way to protect American Muslims âfrom anyone who may want to hurt you because they think you vaguely resemble a terrorist.â

Egyptâs inclusion to boost CPEC, says NA speaker

The parody video sheds light on the way in which racial stereotypes have endangered people, and the fact that Muslims encounter such stereotypes on a daily basis. The âkitâ includes American flags âto drape all over your house every direction,â a t-shirt that says, âone of the good onesâ, and an audio exercise CD that help users sound more âwhite.â

In addition, Youssef has also included in his âkitâ a photo with the country singer Toby Keith, and a backpack patch that says, âjust some books and a laptop.â The kit also comes with an audio recording keychain with phrases in it resembling, âI hereby condemn yesterdayâs terrorist attack, and all terrorist attacks. Bye bye!â

Youssef added that the kit also comes with a âWhite flightâ application that detects the location of people who have posted âalt-rightâ Facebook statuses or joined such groups on Reddit. âIf whites get close, youâll know to take a flight as quickly as possible,â he adds.

Interestingly, this kit isnât only reserved for the Muslims, but also those who âlookâ like them. This kit is called âVaguely Muslim-Looking Morning after kit.â

Visa for Egyptians aimed at preventing âterroristsâ: Sudan

In addition to producing this satirical skewering of Islamophobia, Youssef has become the subject of a new documentary, âTickling Giants,â chronicling his life as a persecuted political commentator in Egypt.

I am a lawyer who decided to be a comedian. I never thought my two worlds would collide so perfectly one day. I have used all of my legal knowledge and gone through the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) recently revealed report and now, I am going to translate it into Pakistani â a language all of us understand.

The JIT was formed to find what the sources of funds are

Translation: We wanted everybody to know conclusively how the Sicilian mafia works before making any decision. Hey â we are the Supreme Court â when have we ever taken haste in dismissing a government or legitimising an illegal government? We are completely independent of politics â look at JIT to keep you occupied!

The affidavits of Tariq Shafi are unreliable. His signatures are different

Translation: How lazy are you man? If you were going to forge documents, you should have at least signed all of them yourself. You made other people sign! You truly do live like a king.

The Ahli Steel Mills document does not exist

Translation: Nawaz Sharif claims his dog ate his office work.

Tariq Shafi said Shehbaz Sharif was involved. Shehbaz Sharif said he was not involved

Translation: Aahâ¦ another case of he said, Shah said â Shehbaz Sharif is lying and trying to ensure he does not go down with his brother. He is building an underpass for himself to get out of this flood but he will drown with the rest of them.

As ministers bash JIT, PM confers with top aides

No document proving business started with 100% loan

Translation: Chori ka paisa hoga.

The liabilities of Gulf Steel were cleared possibly through undeclared wealth

Translation: Please refer to the aforementioned chori ka paisa.

No document shown to prove how money reached Qatar, Jeddah, or UK

Translation: The Sharif family is engaged in something that rhymes with funny maundering â yes, it is money laundering. You win nothing â just like the Sharif family from this JIT.

The liabilities repayment would have wiped out any sale proceeds

Translation: Chori ka paisa + chori ka paisa â chori ka paisa x chori ka paisa = chori ka paisa.

Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif during his address to the nation stated that in 1980 this factory (Gulf Steel Mills) was sold for AED 33.7 million. This is not consistent with either the documents/records provided by the respondents or the findings of the JIT

Translation: So, if anybody wants to file an application declaring him to be not âsadiq and ameenâ and not fit to be a prime minister, we are ready to hear you out.

Moreover, no Imran Khan, we do not mean physically, is fit to be the premier â stop with the push-ups already.

Respondents story about Gulf is unauthentic, lacks substance and seems fabricated

Translation: Just like everything else they say â ye bhi jhoot hay.

JIT suggests filing NAB reference against Sharif family

Sales proceeds from Gulf Steel Mills never reached Jeddah, Qatar or UK

Translation: The Sharif family should have at least pretended they won âWho Wants to a Millionaireâ a few hundred times.

The beneficial owner of the Neilson Enterprises Limited and the Nescoll Limited is Maryam Safdar

Translation: The Sharif family should have thought about protecting Maryam when they were distributing properties in London like it was candy to all of their children.

Maryam has submitted fake/falsified documents to the JIT, which is a criminal offence. Mr Hussain Nawaz and Captain Safdar have also signed these documents

Translation: At least the Sharifs will have company in jail.

Comprehensive report duly signed by Robert W. Radley(Radley Forensic Document Laboratory) London âI have identified the type font used to produce both certified declarations to be âCalibriâ. However, âCalibriâ was not commercially available before 31st January 2007 and as such, neither of the originals of the certified Declarations is correctly dated and happy to have been created at some later point in timeâ

Translation: The Sharifs clearly did not learn in school that ânaqlâ kay liye bhi âaqalâ chaiye hoti hay.

Mr Nawaz distanced himself from the apartments

Translation: Even the father who gave them the property does not want to get involved in the mess. Is the court to believe Hussain Nawaz invented Facebook and became a billionaire while he was a teenager thus was able to afford all these properties?

Complete JIT report on Sharifsâ offshore properties

Repeated changes in Hussain Nawazâs stance indicates possible efforts to conceal facts

Translation: Jhoot pakra gaya.

True owners of the Sharif family were the Sharif family â Nawaz seems to employ his children and two BVI entities to conceal his true ultimate ownership

Translation: Like you know, like every wealthy Pakistani father.

âMr Hasan Nawaz, in his statement before the JIT, explained that Mr Hussain Nawaz Sharif had sent him 2.4 million GBP to help him set his business without declaring the source where the money was coming fromâ

Translation: 324386304.00 Pakistani rupees. We are sure Hussain Nawaz earned this through his tech start-up. Sure 320 million can sustain thousands of livelihoods for years in Pakistan but it is peanuts for the Sharif family.

Hasan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz did not have any independent source of income till 2000

Translation: Yet he was distributing millions like Edhi.

Shahbaz Sharifâs reluctance to discuss Qatari letters

Translation: The junior Sharif thinks he will be able to get out of this sinking ship, or at least Hamza will be the next chief minister of Punjab but we are onto him. He goes down with the rest of him.

Al Thani Family did not own the Mayfair apartments

Translation: Qatar cannot even save them now.

Confirmation of fictitious sale/purchase agreements by the respondents

Translation: Yeh bik gayi hai gormint.

The basic summary of the JIT recommendations is that sab hie chor hain, sab hie jhootay hain.

YANGON, MYANMAR: The editor of one of Myanmarâs top newspapers will face trial for defaming the military by posting a satirical article on Facebook, under a controversial law critics say is stifling press freedom.

Myanmar anti-Islam monk says barred from Facebook

Last month the army sued the editor in chief of The Voice, Kyaw Min Swe, for uploading a link to an article poking fun at the militaryâs leaders for sitting around talking while ordinary soldiers are killed. On Friday a court in Yangon sent him to the cityâs notorious Insein prison to await the start of his trial next week.

Hopes had been high that Myanmarâs first freely elected government in generations would usher in a new era of free speech when they took power last year after half a century of military rule. But defamation prosecutions have soared since Aung San Suu Kyiâs National League for Democracy (NLD) came to power, with social media satirists, activists and journalists increasingly targeted.

Activists say various defamation laws are being used to stifle free speech and stop the media from criticising the government.

Kyaw Min Swe is being prosecuted under the countryâs broadly-worded telecommunications law â known as â66(d)â â which forbids uploading false of defamatory information online. If convicted he faces up to six months in jail.

The writer of the article, Kyaw Swa Naing, was acquitted by the court on Friday because he did not actually upload his piece. Speaking to reporters outside court, he said the law âmust be amendedâ.

âJournalists are being harmed very much. Although we do not know what the verdict will be for brother Kyaw Min Sweâ¦ heâs now being held in prison,â he added.

Dozens of journalists and free speech activists wearing white armbands and with painted faces protested near the court on Friday, displaying banners emblazoned with âpress freedomâ in red.

âThe government is letting people and organisations sue journalistsâ¦ using a (law) that should be abolished under the NLD,â protesters Phyo Wai said.

Facebook âbanâ of anti-Muslim slur sparks Myanmar outcry

The Voice article at the centre of the case poked fun at a military propaganda film called âPyi Daung Su Thit Sarâ (Faithful to the Union) lauding the armyâs victories over armed ethnic groups.

It was released just weeks before the start of the governmentâs latest round of tense peace negotiations with Myanmarâs myriad insurgent groups, and as some of the heaviest fighting in decades rages in border areas.

The run-up to Pakistanâs upcoming general elections next year have taken an interesting turn, as election campaigns of Pakistanâs leading political parties have been leaked. Read the proposed pathways of PML-N, PTI, PPP and others to their possible victories and pick your winner.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)

Politics is temporary but Biryani is forever. We survived the past five years and so did you, letâs survive five more together. No more Panama, only nara pajama.

We promise to make more roads and import fancy buses to make it seem like the country is progressing. Look at all our metro buses; we are the most metrosexual party ever. Load-shedding will be over by 2019 promise, pinky promise.

No JIT can bring us down. Unless it is more than two hours, then Hussain Nawaz gets tired.

Elections 2018: âMake resolution of peopleâs issues a priorityâ

Just donât look at all these flats we are buying around the world â those are just in case papa decides democracy time is over and we all need to stop pretending. Load-shedding will be over by 2020 promise, pinky promise. Maryam Nawaz > Hamza Shahbaz.

Promise everything and deliver nothing. Load-shedding will be over by 2021 promise, pinky promise.

When youâre with us, youâre family. Do your corruption. Do your murders. Do your terrorism. As long as nobody reports about anything, we wonât care. Just continue voting for us. As long as we have Punjab, we have nothing to worry about.

Remember when Shahbaz said he would drag Asif Ali Zardari through the streets? You have to give us five more years if you want to see that happen â we are saving that for the DVD special. Maryam Nawazâs twitter > Imran Khanâs twitter

Load-shedding will be over by 2099 promise, pinky promise.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)

Imran Khan is neither Asif Ali Zardari nor Nawaz Sharif. Wait, what? You need more reasons to vote for us? Well, do we need to stand for anything when we can simply stand against everything?

The only tabdeeli that comes is the one in our political positions.

We have figured out what you donât want. We have no idea what you want or how to even give it to you but, we agree with you that we donât want what you donât want as well so, we are on the same page then. All we know is that tabdeeli is coming; we have no idea what will happen when it is here.

How PML-Nâs trying to win voter support in 2018 elections

Nobody cares if our party has the same guys as all the other parties just look at how beautiful Imran Khan is and he is single again. Nobody was going to vote for a 64-year-old married man.

Are you an electable? JOIN PTI! We can deal with your criminal records; corruption and complete lack of principles later, just get elected for now.

We will fight corruption because Imran Khan isnât corrupt. Such logic, much wow.

We will fight terrorism because Imran Khan isnât a terrorist.

We will fight India because Imran Khan isnât an Indian.

So, basically just forget all policy and agenda items and just look at Imran Khan. Do you like what you see? Vote for us then! You donât even need to know our names, just vote for the bat.

Also, the best jalsas. By far.

Donât trust Javed Hashmi when he says the plan is to get two-three people killed. Trust us, we cannot win an election by just getting two-three people killed, more like 20-30 maybe.

Also Twitter trolls. So, so, so, many Twitter trolls. Facebook ka Prime Minister is a legit position ok.

Pakistan Peopleâs Party (PPP)

Have you all forgotten the period of 2008 to 2013? Great! Then we are back again. Letâs pretend Asif Ali Zardari was never the president.

You know how sometimes you have a headache but then you get cancer for a few years and you forget that you ever had a headache because cancer hurts so much now? Well, the headache is back and after cancer, it doesnât seem that bad.

Also look at how shiny Bilawal Bhutto is. He even speaks Urdu now â or what he thinks is Urdu. In the next update, we will also try to make him speak Sindhi.

Nawaz Sharif foreseen to win 2018 polls: report

Want to know what he stands for and what his policies are? He is Benazirâs son and Zulfiqar Ali Bhuttoâs grandson. Want to know what PPP will do once the party comes into power? Have we told you who Bilawalâs mother and grandfather are?

What are going to be our major campaign ideas? What? Do you want me to draw the Bhutto family tree for you? Also, we have the best political song. Admit it â you want to dance to it on your mehndi also. And of course, the most holidays because we have the most shaheeds.

Make Pakistan great again. Go back to the days when we got 10% of everything.

Also Zinda hay Bilawal â wait it was a secret Zardari strategy that was not supposed to be leaked.

Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)

We exist. No promise we are still a political reality. Remember the days we complained that we had our backs against the wall? Well now that we are giving Anarkali Company inside the wall that doesnât seem that bad.

BUTâ¦hey look at how we were victimised, if nothing else, have some sympathy and give us your cell phones, I mean votes. I swear, we meant votes.

Musharraf likely to contest 2018 general elections

Why are you even looking for campaign ideas? When have we ever had any? Just look at what your identity is and vote for it. If you donât, we will send our karkun and they will vote on your behalf.

Also, donât forget to take your CNICs back from us the day after elections. We canât keep them forever â or maybe we can till, at least, the next Skype call from London.

We go from the wall to your Facebook wall. You know you want to share that cute Altaf Hussain video. The only thing more popular than puppies on social media are Altaf Bhaiâs pappis â ek pappi idhar, ek pappi udhar.

Awami Muslim League (AML)

When you can buy the milk, why buy the Buffalo?

Jamaat-i-Islami (JI)

Look, we are PTIâs ally so we canât be that bad right? And we are Islamic so if you are Muslim, you must vote for us.

We at least have an agenda. We oppose capitalism, communism, liberalism, socialism, secularism and Miley Cyrus. Mainly, Miley Cyrus â she has been used by the West as a wrecking ball against Pakistan. So what if Maududi opposed Jinnah and Pakistan. Pakistan exists now and we want some of that cake too now that it has been made.

Also, free ice cream for all the women (bought by their mehrams for them).

And no uncovered lollypops. Ever. Everyone except us is a kafir.

Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F)

What is our agenda? Depends â how much are you willing to pay?

Say no to Petrol. Only Diesel.

393,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1412053/sneak-peak-cpec-master-plan/,A sneak peak into the CPEC Master Plan,5/18/2017,"KarachÂ­i will soon be called China Town under CPEC

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was recently in China to participate in the âOne Belt, One Roadâ summit, which is ironic since his name and the word belt have never been used in the same sentence before. Many people have to tie two belts together and a nara with izarband each time when choosing to wear a suit. The struggle is real, people, especially for our respected premier.

At great risk to my personal well-being, I somehow managed to stick my hand in the pocket of PM Nawazâs suit shalwar and pull out the longest term plan for the China-Pak Economic Dumbledore, I mean Corridor. I uttered Dumbledore first because the way China has convinced us that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a game-changer for Pakistan has to be magic. I would not be surprised if Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang tried giving Nawaz some âlove potionâ the last time they met. There is a reason why their love is higher than the mountains and deeper than the seas, you know.

Pakistan highly attractive destination for investment: PM Nawaz

And guess whatâ¦ the CPEC master plan revelations are truly shocking.

The Shan (soon to be called Shan-Ghai masalay) advertisement was just the start. The Chinese are planning to replace every kind of Biryani (mind you) in Pakistan with Chicken Manchurian. In many ways, the master plan is exactly like the advertisement; to lure neighbours into friendship with food. When the loving dadi in the advertisement tells the Chinese woman, âIsko apna hee ghar samjhoâ, she just smiles knowing that that was her plan all along.

You know Nawaz Sharif is involved when all it took to win people over was a plate of biryani â this is basically how he took office.

The CPEC master plan has a simple proposal for agriculture which can be summarised in just four words: We grow, they eat. Everyone who once laughed at the Chinese people for eating dogs will not be laughing anymore when they will end up eating all our crops.

The Chinese idea to increase agricultural exports to one of the most water-stressed countries in the world is genius! If all the water goes to the crops then none of the water will be left for drinking, which will cure all our population-related problems.

If the, soon to be implemented, one child per house Chinese policy does not seem to work in Pakistan then the scarcity of water will do the trick â and please. Donât worry about how so many Chinese will fit in Pakistan because dil mai jaga honi chaiye, yaar.

China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: âLong-term planâ to be inked soon

According to the plan, Karachiâs new name will be âChina Townâ and, in a reversal of fortune, Karachi will be the name of a restaurant in China Town. Lahore is to be called Lo Ho Ping, Gwadar is to be named Lo A Gaye Hum and Islamabadâs new name is Char Jao Ab Ling.

It is unclear what punishment the Chinese will give to those who shut down Chinese parlours in Islamabad. All the popular religious parties, who claimed communist parties could never win elections in Pakistan, are reportedly re-evaluating their beliefs.

The Chinese are also producing a sequel to the movie âChalay thay saathâ now called âChalay thay saath billionâ. The movie revolves around sending the entire Chinese population into Pakistan and ends with the region being surrounded by the Great Wall of China. It is obviously fictionâ¦ for now.

The full surveillance system will ensure that Pakistanis do not do to the Great Wall of China what they do to every wall in the country. Huge sign boards saying saying âGreat Wall of China par peshab karna mana hayâ. In Mandarin. But that will not be a problem because soon it will be mandatory for all Pakistanis to learn Mandarin. The process has already started at primary schools.

The CPEC masterâs master plan also reveals the internet in Pakistan will be replaced by cat videos. It envisions a deep and broad based penetration â which is what most Pakistani teenage boys also envision when they use the internet. No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram; the internet will just be billions and billions of cat videos.

The aim is replicate the calm that the people of Pakistan had when PTV was the only channel available. Just like Ayub Khan had videos of tractors everywhere. Even when the country was on the verge of a disaster, the nation remained calm because they watched videos teaching them how to drive tractors. What was the countryâs domestic policy, you ask? People donât know because when Pakistanis are driving tractors they are not thinking about the domestic policy.

In the same way, instead of worrying about their civil liberties and fundamental rights people will watch cat videos. The cuteness of the videos will distract them enough to forget about everything else.

394,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1410222/guide-pakistani-parents-kill-childs-curiosity/,A guide for Pakistani parents: How to kill your childs curiosity,5/16/2017,"A helpfuÂ­l guide broughÂ­t to you by the PakistÂ­an ParentÂ­ing AssociÂ­ation

A helpful guide brought to you by the Pakistan Parenting Association.

Most smart parents know that too much curiosity is a bad thing. Raising a child, especially an inquisitive one, is quite a challenge. We want our child to grow up to be a practical, well-to-do individual with an aura of respect and prestige. We donât want them to become writers, artists or â Allah-na-keray â philosophers.

Here are a few ways you can keep those pesky questions to the minimum, and raise a successful, practical offspring who will conform to societal standards and make you proud!

1) Protect yourself first

Much like the instruction for oxygen masks on airplanes â protect yourself first, then protect your child. Try not to get yourself sucked into the curiosity trap, and try not to learn too much about the world â the more you know, the more you realize that you know very little, which in turn makes you curious, not unlike the child you are trying to discipline.

Every now and then, you may find yourself in a weak moment, contemplating a new idea for the sake of understanding the world. This is precisely the dangerous behavior you are trying to protect your child from.

Project for out-of-school children launched in Islamabad

Entertaining strange new ideas is like substance abuse â itâs very easy to get carried away. If you arenât careful, youâll find yourself interrogating your decades-old, firmly held beliefs that youâve fought hard to keep intact; beliefs that have now become part of your identity. And your identity is your source of pride, so protect it at all cost.

2) Nip it in the bud

Donât leave your childâs questions unattended. Childhood curiosity can be tenacious. Not answering the question right away only means the question will pop up again. Now, imagine if you were not around when the question came up. Other adults may encourage your childâs curiosity, or worse, answer your childâs question in a way that is unacceptable to you. The trick, therefore, is to think on your feet, and come up with an easily digestible answer the first time itself. Just make sure the answer does not contradict another unrelated answer you had given earlier. If you do this, be prepared for a volley of questions, precisely what you were avoiding.

Helpful tip: Donât worry about being logical or realistic. Being the parent, you can literally make your child believe anything you want without much evidence or logic. Use your position in the relationship to your advantage.

3) Obedience

Your most important weapon in the fight against curiosity is obedience. This is a trait you need to inculcate in your child as early as possible. Itâll make things a lot easier for you, your child, and all the authority figures your child will be subjected to in the future â teachers, school administrators, religious authority figures, the government, the police, and the military. For a society, as for a family, to keep functioning the way itâs functioning without disruption, we need obedience. If it wasnât for obedient children who grew up to become subservient adults, would Pakistan have made the remarkable progress that it has?

Footpath School children in Karachi dance their hearts out

Helpful tip: If you are a father, it helps to think of yourself as the âhead of stateâ and your offspring as the âsubjectâ. Own the position â protect it, and make sure you and your position remain significant for a long time. If you are the mother, you are the deputy of the âhead of stateâ. Your job is to always support your husband. If you have a difference of opinion with him, just ignore it, and set a good example for your child of how to be obedient.

Another helpful tip: Do not ever apologise if you make a mistake â it undermines your authority as a parent. In fact, according to some thinkers, itâs not a mistake if your heart was in the right place, and as parents, your heart is always in the right place. Thatâs just a fact. If you cannot resist the urge to apologise, make sure you downplay the mistake, and never use the words âmistakeâ, âsorryâ or âapologizeâ.

4) Use the fear of rejection

Tell your child that publicly questioning conventional beliefs will draw ridicule from relatives, friends, and coworkers. If they question things too much, they may even be ostracized. Even if they do so privately, questioning fundamental beliefs can trigger an existential crisis, which, as we all know, leads quickly to suicide. Give them examples of European philosophers, many of whom committed the grave sin of suicide because they wouldnât stop questioning things.

So, it is best to be safe and not question things at all. Only accept new ideas if they, beyond doubt, support your existing ideas and worldview.

5) School

Donât worry too much about what your child studies at school; most schools have evolved to feed information to and discipline future job seekers. Even thatâs something they struggle to achieve in Pakistan, so there isnât much to worry about.

Three children used as drug mules rescued

There is a reason schools focus on Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Math and English as opposed to Sociology, Government, Politics, Philosophy and Anthropology. The former are practical subjects that prepare workers of the future to secure jobs and support their families. The latter only get them worked up and upset about perfectly normal things like strictly-defined gender roles.

Occasionally, however, you may come across an idealistic principal or a teacher who has a liberal arts background. They may encourage the inquisitive nature of your child, so avoid educators and schools that have an idealistic inclination.

6) University

Another problematic situation arises when your child is ready to go to university. They may not agree with what youâve decided for them to study, and may put up resistance. This usually happens if they have gained some emotional and intellectual independence, i.e. they feel it is okay for them to entertain ideas that they know you wonât approve of. This is dangerous territory.

If your child says they want to study literature, philosophy or sociology, you know youâre in trouble. Use whatever tactic you can to dissuade them. If they win, be prepared to deflect questions about your childâs career from inquisitive guests and relatives at weddings and iftar parties. While they go on and on about their sonâs amazing job at Unilever, youâll be struggling to recall what exactly your child does at the newspaper.

To avoid this situation be vigilant from the time your child is born. Keep idealistic relatives away from your child, and be especially vigilant of the childâs older cousins and friends. A category we often take for granted are science geeks â they are practical, smart and usually have jobs, but their ideas can encourage young people to be skeptical, to question conventional thinking, and to stop being intellectually complacent. Engineering graduates in Pakistan typically do not fall into this category, so donât worry about them.

Find a university for your child that does not admit students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, or other categories of people you would not want your child to end up marrying. Exposure to the class system can also make a young adult become aware of the glaring inequality in society, and encourage them to question things. Stick with private universities where the environment is devoid of political thought, and students come from largely similar, well-to-do backgrounds. These universities regularly arrange pointless events to keep students busy, and give them a sense of belonging.

Helpful tip: If you feel that the university is too open-minded, or there is too much inter-gender mingling, or the girls are not appropriately dressed, gather other parents and approach the university management. Since you are paying the tuition fee, you are the universityâs ultimate customer, not your child. No one understands this better than the university management.

7) Marriage

Try to get your daughters married soon after they graduate from university, and your sons as soon as they find a stable job (unless you need either of them to support you financially). Being unmarried with newfound independence may give your child space to contemplate and entertain interesting new questions, like âWhy do people have children?â. Be mindful of what they are doing with their income; for example, if they buy too many books, youâre in trouble. So plan ahead and keep your son or daughter occupied with major life events, like their wedding, their first child, their second childâ¦ you get the picture.

Helpful tip: Although your child becomes an adult at the age of 18 and can legally do everything that adults can, like owning property, getting married to whoever they choose, and fighting for the country, it is advisable to not highlight the fact that they are now independent adults, much like yourself. Keep using the words larka and larki â as opposed to aadmi and aurat â to refer to young adults, until they get married and have two kids of their own, or until they start looking like theyâre 37.

Remember that only the most obedient, practical and self-centered children will make it to the top in our society, bringing their parents immense pride and joy.

395,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1410238/tv-show-black-mirror-based-pakistan/,If the TV show Black Mirror was based in Pakistan,5/16/2017,"The BritisÂ­h televiÂ­sion show deals with the realitÂ­ies of our modern world and we can relate it to PakistÂ­ani societÂ­y

KARACHI : Whenever writers, film-makers or artists have explored the idea of a dystopian society, they always talk about it with reference to the future. We always think the worst is yet to come. In a paradoxical antithesis of the idea of hope, we most importantly want to feel safe in the here and now. âItâs alright so far,â we say. But what if itâs not? What if we are merely pretending that it is? What if the future is now and we donât have to be afraid of the unpleasantness of the future dystopian world because we already live in it and as shocking as it may be, we are comfortable in it.

The increasing anger and frustration of this segmented world, the boiling paranoia of everything we donât understand, and the technological invasion of our lives has turned us into the very creatures we read about in dystopian literature and feel afraid. âWe are not them,â we say. But what if we are?

Gender equality: Educating women a must for enlightened society: Shehbaz

British television show Black Mirror deals with all the realities of our modern world and how we have become what we said we never would: paranoid humanoids who would steal someoneâs oxygen to keep themselves alive. We have become the kind who inhales fear and exhales disgust. We live in a world where mob mentality overrules any laws and regulations. In literary dystopias, it is most often the government who is the controlling evil. But in todayâs dystopia, it is the people. Mob mentality prevails and sanity is buried somewhere thousands of miles under the mine-filled land of distrust, hatred, and blind rage.

An interesting fact about Black Mirror is that it, in its own twisted way, predicted Trumpâs presidency and even told a story of a fictional British prime minister having a âveryâ close relationship with a pig. Coincidentally, knowledge of an uncorroborated anecdote between actual former British PM David Cameron and a pig was later made public. While the television show has made interesting social commentary on todayâs perverted world, we wonder how it would look if it was made in Pakistan. If anything, recent happenings in the country have offered more than a glimpse of the bitter society we live in, and it would be interesting to see how the showâs creator Charlie Brooker would tackle them.

We discuss six recent happenings in Pakistan that would make for brilliant Black Mirror episodes.

We are Mashal Khan: Civil society comes out in support of slain university student

1) Qandeel Balochâs life

Call her an attention-seeking wannabe model or a symbol for unapologetic independent women, Qandeel Balochâs life surely fits the bill for a Black Mirror episode. Itâs unsurprising, yet interesting to see how social media can change and even end lives. It was social media which hyped, mocked, and made Baloch a celebrity for no reason. It was social media that inadvertently caused her demise. We donât even need to add fictional elements to make it a Black Mirror episode. A simple biopic with emphasis on the role of the internet and how its influence destroys lives is enough to make us reflect, at least temporarily, on our careless behaviour when we are anonymous. âWe didnât do it. They did,â we say.

2) Mashal Khan incident

The fact that Mashal Khan was brutally murdered not by the âlesser educatedâ (generally believed to be more extremist-adjacent) but rather his own fellow university students and faculty, is evidence enough that education and technology donât change manâs inherently violent nature. If anything, it merely enhances it and gives it different ways to implement it. We have moved on from swords and spears to guns and missiles. Yet, Khanâs story reminds us of our animal nature where a quick death isnât enough to satisfy us.

Itâs a classic case of mob mentality overpowering the general rules of a civilised society.

Imagine a world where it was legal for people to murder and maim anyone they perceive as guilty of a crime. What would become of the society where purging of sanity was encouraged?

Mardan university student accused of blasphemy beaten to death on campus

3) Yasir Hussainâs child molestation joke

Yasir Hussain caught heat when he made his lifeâs biggest mistake by joking about child molestation at a recent awardâs show. Sitting comfortable in his home, he apologised and was largely forgiven. A couple of weeks later, the incident is largely forgotten as we dwell on our latest obsession. With our short attention spans, thatâs what we do. We raise our voice on one issue, forget about it the next day and move on. But what if those twitter warriors were actually willing to go farther than typing 140 characters?

Imagine a world where governments donât exist and all conflicts are solved by public trials where angry people decide what to do. Hussain would not go forgiven from the trial, even after hundreds of apologies. Itâs cruel to imagine what would come of him, but it wonât be a surprise, given this is the direction weâre headed toward as a society.

4) Waqar Zakaâs beatdown

This may seem eerily similar to Black Mirrorâs â15 Million Meritsâ episode from the first season. Television ratings and online views are all the rage. Brands, corporate companies and channels are willing to spend money on anything that goes viral. In the aforementioned episode, Bingâs rant about being sick of the slave-like society powered by ratings and constant distraction through entertainment shockingly earns him a television show of his own. Zakaâs incident may or may not have earned him sympathy or a new television show (along with his attacker), but it did earn him thousands of views, which translate as free publicity. It served as a good distraction for people and now itâs largely forgotten about. What if the entire episode with Zaka, his beatdown, and the eventual resolution of the conflict with his attacker landed him a series? It would not be far-fetched to think it could happen. In this day and age, free publicity (positive or negative) is like winning a jackpot. Youâre sure to become popular for 15 minutes, or could end up drowning in your 15 million rupees.

5) Naureen Laghari

A medical student, Naureen Laghari made headlines last month when she was captured for being involved with ISIS. An educated girl from the province which is a symbol of peace and love and Sufi scholars had joined ISIS and was set to suicide attack a church on Easter. She allegedly met a man through Facebook who lured her into joining the group. She disappeared, travelled to Syria, married another terrorist and returned to Pakistan to carry out her mission. The potential Black Mirror episode could revolve around her family and friends trying to find her, and the mystery of what urged Laghari to go in that direction.

6) Ramazan ban on eating/drinking in public

Religion is a personal matter. The entire point of fasting is to not be affected by the tempting surroundings. If we are to remove the temptations in our surroundings, then whatâs the point of fasting anyway?

It does not test a Muslimâs faith and actually shows how weak it is. We donât even need to imagine a world where eating and drinking is banned during Ramazan because itâs happening right here. What you can imagine is the suffering of all those who canât fast â elderly, sick, pregnant women, children, and how this ban will affect them. With the scorching heat waves this region is known for, it is bound to end with people dying due to dehydration and other factors. The ridiculousness and unsurprising level of public support for the ban screams Black Mirror at this point. I wonder how it would go down if a hungry child or elderly person falls victim to a mob.

Couple gets death over âblasphemousâ text message

This is sadly the dark truth of our fearful society. We go to curb anything and everything to protect our convictions. As we go about our lives mocking a stranger online or fighting our friend for questioning authority or common beliefs, we need to understand that the black mirror of our cellphones and laptops is actually showing a truer reflection of us than the dressing table mirrors.

396,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1375867/denying-entry-pakistani-fulbright-scholar-major-victory-war-terror-us/,Denying entry to Pakistani Fulbright scholar major victory in war on terror: US,4/6/2017,"US exposeÂ­s PakistÂ­anâs grand plan to bring down their countrÂ­y by exportÂ­ing academÂ­ic terrorÂ­ists

Our cover has finally been blown. For decades, Pakistani students have managed to sneak their way into the United States secretly pouring millions of dollars in education fees into the US economy and adding diversity to their college programmes. For decades, top Pakistani brains have made sufficient breakthroughs in academic research in the US adding to their college departments. For decades, brilliant Pakistani professionals have graduated from top US universities to diversify and innovate the US markets.

But all this terrorism will now come to an end. The US finally realised our grand plan to bring down their country by developing their economy and opening up emerging markets for them.

Pakistani Fulbright scholar denied entry into the US despite valid visa

We were once the second-fastest growing and the seventh-largest ethnic group in the United States but clearly, we were just mooching off Uncle Sam and contributed absolutely nothing to the country. About 500,000 Pakistanis just sitting on the couch eating American doughnuts and planning the next terrorist attack in the country â itâs just that Pakistanis are lazy which is why 500,000 people have only managed a handful of terrorist attacks in the last two decades.

A Pakistani even almost managed to get a US President elected. Huma Abedin would have finally managed to put Hilary Clinton â an ISI agent â in the White House, thus fulfilling the decade-long Pakistani plan to infiltrate the upper echelons of the states.

Hillary takes a leaf out of Imran Khanâs playbook

We were so close â in Saqib Ali, Ali Sajjad Taj, Arif Alikhan, Shamila N Chaudhry we had mayors, advisors, delegates and representatives. They would have all come together at the right time to summon Captain Pakistan â heâs the superhero who is going to bring the US down to zero. Saghir Tahir even managed to get elected on a Republican Party ticket â a Pakistani-Muslim elected representative in the Republican Party? That would be like Bernie Sanders being named the new khalifa of ISIS.

Clearly, Pakistani academics have contributed nothing to the United States and all these people are simply terrorists in the making. I applaud the decision of the US to deny entry into the US to Zia Shah, a Fulbright scholar. Zia Shah wanted to teach empathy, well how can he do that without having faced extreme prejudice himself? If anything, the US is helping him experience something crucial to his education and training work. One must face extremism to help others facing extremism.

All his work in developing peace and empathy would have led to so much terrorism. We all know peace is only a euphemism for war â why else would the US claim to be the most peace-loving nation in the world? You want some peace? Here are some bombs instead.

Now Donald Trump is here to put an end to all this academic terrorism being exported from Pakistan. It is time to make the Fulbright program fully dim. No more H-1B visas for the top of class graduates, no more opportunities to bring their unique expertise and specialisation to America and no more curry. Face it, if it wasnât for Britain and America, we would not even have curry. No Pakistani in Pakistan has ever had curry or naan bread â which by the way is just naan! That would be like calling it chai tea â wait a minute Starbucks does have a chai tea option.

Pakistan doesnât need Starbucks

If Pakistanis didnât want to become terrorists, why would they learn chemistry and aeronautical engineering in America? All these academics are simply pretending to be peace-loving. They are all covert spies. As soon as the global call to jihad happens Akbar S Ahmed will leave anthropology and raise havoc on America like The Mummy Returns â it will be a bigger disaster than Brendan Fraserâs career.

Ayesha Jalal will stop teaching history at Tufts University and start making the United States itself history. Adil Najam will leave teaching Geography and work towards wrecking geography â the Grand Canyon is about to get so much wider.

Farooq Azam will leave marine microbiology and accept his real secret identity â Pakistani Aquaman. Some time ago, he had to apply for asylum in the United States after he was repeatedly hunted by Baloch fishermen off the coast of Karachi.

10 ways to enter the United States if youâre a Muslim

Saleem H Ali will stop researching the environment and start working on destroying it. But wait, Trump already has that covered so we Pakistanis can do what we love doing the most â just sit back and watch doing nothing.

We all know ISIS simply stands for Islamabad School of Institutional Scoundrels. Itâs about time we stop exporting these academic terrorists. These vile creatures are allowed to do their work here; maybe build a few more universities and colleges here too while they are at it.

397,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1336417/not-content-just-fighting-taliban-pakistan-pm-flies-turkey-fight-islamic-state/,"Tired of fighting Taliban at home, PM flies to Turkey to fight Islamic State",2/23/2017,"He is not the leader we want but much like Batman, he is the leader we deservÂ­e.

I salute Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for all the bravery he has shown in the past week. When Pakistan was being marred by daily terrorist attacks, our prime minister was at the forefront of the violence â safely hiding in the basement of his house in Raiwind.

A firm believer in the proverb that âsilence speaks louder than wordsâ, he reassured a frantic nation with his silence. Nawaz Sharif has even gone the extra mile of ensuring not only his vocal silence but also his physical one.

When the nation has been threatened by war from terrorist organisations, he has taken the confrontation head on by flying to Turkey for three days. Heâs not the leader we want but, much like Batman, heâs the leader we deserve. Not content with just fighting TTP in Pakistan, heâs going to Turkey to fight the Islamic State also. If only the United Nations trusted him with the Middle East, even Germany would be Palestine by now.

Nawaz, Imran and Zardari share New Year resolutions

When people from around the country were picking up bodies from their shrines, their streets and their homes, they were at least happy in the knowledge that their leader was safe at his house enjoying a warm meal.

I am sure all the people dying of terrorism are happy to know that our economy is on the rise â nothing better than financial manipulation by Ishaq Dar and cooking up some books to placate the nation. So what if you are not safe anywhere in the country, a mythical number in a book somewhere is bigger than what it was last year.

It doesnât matter that life for the peasant in Pakistan has not changed for centuries. At least their colonisers were better looking a century ago.

Lord Mountbatten did not pretend to care about the locals but Nawaz Sharif is the real man of the people. Whereas the British built rail roads to steal local resources and transfer them to the centre, our government has never done that. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) does not build railways â they are known for building roads. Roads that move goods from all over Pakistan to the centre to grow the economy. There is nothing similar to what the British were doing then and what the PML-N is doing now.

Sure there were no hospitals for the wounded of the Sehwan blast and sure when they got to the nearest hospital, there were no beds, adequate equipment, resources or personnel but the nation must appreciate how smooth the roads were on which all injured people were transported. With their dying breath, they must be thanking the government for those roads. If only I could travel through a few underpasses then I can die a happy person.

Donât kidnap me. Iâm not a liberal

Hospitals do not buy you votes. You cannot paste your picture on hospital beds. What this nation needs is roads because they vote on the basis of what they see not what they know. If they see a shiny bus, they are convinced the nation must be progressing. We are all ready to buy a one-way ticket to our deaths on that bus.

Who needs a Quaid-e-Azam speaking to millions to show them he is with them â people who do not even understand the language spoken by Jinnah but are reinvigorated by his very presence? Who needs a Mandela encouraging his supporters from prison? Who needs a Martin Lurther King marching hand in hand? Who needs an Obama, Merkel, Trudeau â leaders who speak to the nation after every calamity to ensue calm and reinforce the nationâs ideals when you have the serenity of radio silence?

You do not need words when you have bombs. How many people died last week? About 200? Alright then letâs bomb 200 âterroristsâ and call it even. It does not matter if some of these terrorists we have known about for a while or if some of them are not even terrorists. As long as the nation sees action, they will forget about this tragedy next week.

It really is a matter of perspective anyway, whoâs to say what the nation should be more outraged about â a bomb at a shrine or Sheema Kermani dancing at a shrine?

Hereâs what Nostradamus predicted about Pakistan in 2017

I am sure we have seen the end of terrorism now that we have dropped a few bombs. From tomorrow, all our leaders will move with no protocol, they will have no need to block a mile of road each time they need to travel, they will not speak to the public behind bulletproof glass, their homes will not be guarded with our tax money, their homes will not stretch for hundreds of miles, they will not move with hundreds of people and tens of cars each time they need to move.

If all of that does not happen then know that they know the country is not safe. They are lying to you. They are all the same. The day you take their privilege away, the day you strip their protection, they will see how the rest of us live and they might want to change that â not for us but for themselves.

I salute Nawaz Sharif for his ability to stay so brave in the face of such adversity. I also salute Imran Khan for all his criticism of the TTP. I am sure the government and the opposition will no longer be in bed with terrorist organisations. After all, the real criminals here are the victims of terrorism or as Rana Sanaullah puts it, if people donât gather and protest, they wonât get bombed in public places. Does he blame the people who die in bomb blasts for the attacks? Guess General Dyer is alive after all.
