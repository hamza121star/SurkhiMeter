",2019-01-17,"A third-year MBBS student was found shot dead in his hostel room at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) in Sindh's Jamshoro district, officials said on Thursday.

The body of the 20-year-old student was found with a gunshot wound on his temple and a pistol in his right hand; it was subsequently shifted to Liaquat University Hospital's city branch for a post-mortem examination.

LUMHS Vice-Chancellor Dr Bikha Ram said the deceased student was alone in his room in the Ibn-e-Sina hostel. When his roommate — who had gone out to attend some programme — returned to the dorm, he found the room's door locked. He broke it open to find his roommate's body lying on the bed, the VC added.

Police reached the site of the incident and seized the weapon found at the scene.

Dr Ram said he has formed an inquiry committee comprising the hostel provost, director of student affairs, warden and the campus director to determine the circumstances that led to the student's death.

He said the incident was an ""apparent suicide"", but the cause of the death was yet to be determined.

According to the VC, the committee will also investigate how the deceased student had apparently managed to bring the gun to the hostel room. The incident has highlighted the need for some preventative measures to be taken by the hostel administration, Dr Ram said.

Jamshoro Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Tauqir Naeem said the death appeared to be a suicide ""on the face of it"", but added that the incident would be probed.

He said they had learnt that a brother of the deceased was battling cancer while another brother had previously died of the same disease.

Dr Ram also quoted the student's friends as saying that he (the deceased) remained depressed allegedly due to his brother's illness.

According to the VC, the young man had reportedly sent a text message to his roommate saying ""Aaj ki raat bari yadgar hogi (Tonight will be very memorable)"", but the roommate had not understood the meaning of the message at the time.",Mohammad Hussain Khan,Dawn,Mental health,"Jamshoro, youth, suicide, mental health",1

",2019-01-17,"The federal cabinet has decided to remove the names of PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah from the Exit Control List (ECL), but refuses to excise them from a joint investigation team's (JIT) report on the fake accounts case, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Accountability Mirza Shahzad Akbar stated at an evening press conference on Thursday.

The decision was made in line with a Supreme Court order to the government to remove the two's names from the ECL and review the cabinet decision to place the names of more than 170 accused in the fake bank accounts case on its travel restrictions list.

The orders came in relation to a suo motu case concerning the delays surrounding a 2015 FIA probe into the laundering of billions of rupees via fake bank accounts.

The JIT investigating the case, formed by the apex court itself, had earlier recommended the placement of a total 172 people on the no-fly-list.

Several bigwigs, including former president Asif Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur, former president of Summit Bank Hussain Lawai and Omni Group's Anwar Majeed, have all been nominated in the case. Property tycoon Malik Riaz, his son-in-law Zain have also been included in the probe.

In its detailed verdict after reviewing reports, the court had ordered that the names of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Shah be removed from both the exit control list and the JIT's report.

The court had further ordered that the case be forwarded to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), and directed the anti-corruption watchdog to wrap up its investigation within two months.

Prime Minister Imran Khan, who chaired the cabinet meeting on Thursday, directed the interior ministry to remove Bilawal and Shah's names from the ECL with immediate effect.

Citing some confusions about the apex court's detailed verdict, Akbar told reporters on Thursday that as per the court's orders, the accountability watchdog can still recommend the placement of the names of the Sindh chief minister and the PPP head again on the ECL if it deems it warranted.

Akbar further noted that the Supreme Court's order had directed that the JIT continue to support NAB, and that the watchdog will file a reference without waiting for the apex court's orders [in case it finds sufficient legal grounds to do so]. He also added that the references will be filed in the accountability courts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

The new chief justice will appoint a monitoring judge to the case, he added.

Other developments

Iftikhar Durrani, special assistant to the prime minister on media, also addressed the presser. He said that the cabinet had also approved the placement of the development and non-development budget of the Capital Administration and Development Division under the interior ministry.

The cabinet further approved the auction of 20 ships of the Ministry for National Food Security. The cabinet also approved the appointment of retired Maj Gen Amir Azeem as chairman Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and the appointment of Ali Raza Bhatta, a Grade 21 officer, as secretary of the Benazir Bhutto Income Support Programme.

The cabinet also approved a supplementary grant of Rs750 million for the National Accountability Bureau.

At the onset of the meeting, the prime minister asked two cabinet members, Ali Zaidi and Fawad Chaudhry, to leave the meeting as the Election Commission of Pakistan has suspended their membership of the National Assembly after they, along with 70 other MNAs, failed to submit details of their assets to the commission in time.

'No mini budget but economic reforms package'

Later, while talking to media, Durrani rejected the impression that the government was going to launch a mini budget on Jan 23, 2019. He also categorically denied reports that the government may increase the ratio of sales tax on Jan 23.

""No new tax is going to be introduced,"" he said, adding that the economic reforms package is aimed at enhancing ease of doing business and to provide some incentives to the business community.",Sanaullah Khan | Javed Hussain,Dawn,Politics,"Islamabad, Sindh, PPP, ECL",1

",2019-01-17,"Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday telephoned Prime Minister Imran Khan to discuss the ongoing international efforts for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.

During the call, Ghani ""expressed his gratitude for Pakistan’s sincere facilitation of these efforts"" that were initiated by US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office said.

Khan assured the Afghan president that Pakistan was making ""sincere efforts for a negotiated settlement"" of the Afghan conflict through an inclusive peace process, ""as part of shared responsibility"".

Ghani invited the premier to visit Afghanistan at his earliest convenience and Khan reciprocated by inviting the Afghan president to visit Pakistan.

""Both leaders also agreed to remain engaged and create an environment for resolving all outstanding issues,"" the press release said.

The conversation between the two leaders comes as Khalilzad earlier today arrived in Pakistan as part of a regional tour to four countries for talks on the Afghan peace process.

According to the Foreign Office, the US special envoy is expected to meet Pakistan's civilian and military leaders during his stay and he will ask Pakistan to help convince the Afghan Taliban to come to the negotiating table. ""Pakistan has also maintained [that] we want an Afghan-led Afghan-owned solution to [the] imbroglio,"" the FO spokesperson said in a statement.

Pakistan is believed to be making serious efforts to arrange a meeting between Khalilzad and Afghan Taliban leaders in Islamabad to help break the deadlock and speed up the Afghan peace process, Dawn reported.

The US envoy is actively trying to broker a political solution to the Afghan conflict and has held multiple meetings with the leadership of Afghanistan as well as that of other countries in the region, including Pakistan.

He has also held three rounds of talks with the Afghan Taliban in order to reach a settlement that would allow the US to withdraw its army and end a 17-year-old war — America's longest.",Sanaullah Khan,Dawn,Foreign Affairs,"Afghanistan, foreign affairs, Imran Khan, Ashraf Ghani",1

",2019-01-17,"Complete address by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa on January 17, 2019 at the full court reference for Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar shared by the Supreme Court of Pakistan

Honourable Chief Justice and my brother Judges, Attorney-General for Pakistan, Vice-Chairman, Pakistan Bar Council, President, Supreme Court Bar Association, Members of the Bar, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen.

The Honourable Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar and I have been conjoined judicial twins for the last about twenty years and eight months.

In the medical jargon conjoined twins are twins whose bodies are connected to each other and it is through a very complicated surgical intervention that such twins may be separated. Mian Sahib and I were elevated to the Bench of the Lahore High Court together on May 21, 1998, we were deposed together on November 03, 2007, we were restored together on August 30, 2008 and we were elevated to the Bench of this Court together on February 18, 2010. In the High Court as well as in this Court our seniority has been next to each other’s and throughout this period of more than two decades we have sat on seats in the tea rooms of the Courts placed next to each other.

During all this while we have been physically together and I may, therefore, not be wrong in saying that we have been conjoined judicial twins.

Alas, by the stroke of midnight tonight these twins shall stand separated physically not through any surgical intervention but through a constitutional intervention and I must hasten to add that the loss through such separation shall be entirely mine. A sincere friend, a trusted confidant, a wise counsel and an accomplished and erudite Judge like Mian Sahib shall no longer be available on the Bench to help, advise and guide me.

The speakers before me have already spoken about how good a Judge Mian Sahib has been.

I can vouch for that and may add that I have served with more than a hundred Judges of the Lahore High Court and of this Court so far and I have found Mian Sahib’s mastery over civil, tax, revenue, service and constitutional law enviable and difficult to match. I have also served with a number of Chief Justices of the Lahore High Court and of this Court and I have no hesitation in acknowledging that Mian Sahib will go down in history as one of those Chief Justices who steered the Court quite ably in testing times.

The tenure of Mian Sahib as the Chief Justice of Pakistan fell in times which were turbulent, to say the least. The saga of the Panama Papers, the issues of constitutional disqualification of political leaders, the events leading to holding of the general elections in the country and the issues arising out of the national effort against terrorism, extremism, corruption and poor governance posed huge challenges but Mian Sahib was able to wade through all those troubled waters and to steer the ship of this Court to safe and still waters.

Despite his preoccupation with such larger national issues he also devoted his attention to many issues of public importance regarding the citizens’ fundamental rights. His keen interest in provision of clean drinking water in cities, removal of encroachments upon the State land, adequate medical facilities in hospitals, proper management of medical and legal education, supply of pure milk, recovery of written-off bank loans, proper investigation of mega corruption scams, population welfare, building of dams and water reservoirs, retirement of national debt and in some other areas of public importance has sensitised the governments and the populace at large on such vital issues. His efforts made towards police reforms are also likely to lead to an upturn in administration of justice.

Mian Sahib, your contributions in all these areas have left a mark and we shall always remember you with admiration and reverence.

Ladies and gentlemen,

As is customary, let us now have a peep into the near future.

With an experience of over two decades as a Judge and with the support of my colleagues also having vast experience I would, if Almighty Allah so wills, like to avail every moment of my remaining time on the Bench to attend to the causes that contribute towards delay in disposition of cases at all levels of the judicial hierarchy.

With an untiring effort of my colleagues having expertise on the criminal side we have already succeeded in deciding thousands of criminal cases and in wiping out the backlog of such cases in this Court and we are now left with only a few hundred pending criminal cases which can be termed as current cases. Such a target and success have seldom been achieved in any Court before and this has been possible in this Court only because the cause-list of the day was kept in control and there was a uniform policy of not entertaining or discouraging applications for adjournment. We understand that for a legal practitioner there cannot be an obligation or engagement more pressing or urgent than to appear before the Court when his or her case is fixed before the Court for hearing. We on the Bench greatly appreciate the cooperation extended to us by the learned counsel in this respect. An effort shall be made to extend and follow the same policy in all other categories of cases as well and we expect the learned counsel to extend similar cooperation to us even in those cases.

For facilitation of the learned counsel and in order to minimise the chances of adjournments modern technology shall be utilized and a possibility shall be explored regarding establishing video links between the Branch Registries of this Court and the Principal Seat through which the learned counsel may address arguments in the courtrooms of the Branch Registries and appropriate Benches of this Court may hear those arguments at the Principal Seat in real time and decide cases. Such innovation may reduce inconvenience and huge expense on the part of all concerned besides diminishing delays caused by non-availability of Benches at the Branch Registries of the Court.

The model courts set up in some of the Districts of the Punjab upon my initiative and under the patronage of Mian Sahib and supervision of Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah when his lordship was the Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court conducted and concluded trials of criminal as well as civil cases in three to four days rather than three to four years as was the case in the yesteryears.

With the approval and cooperation of the High Courts an all-out effort shall be made to expand the said project to the entire country. Even the steps taken towards judicially conducted arbitral interventions during criminal, civil and family litigation have yielded very positive results in the said Province and expansion of the said project shall also be explored seriously.

Mian Sahib had once observed publically that he is left with only two ambitions in life, i.e. to build dams and to retire the national debt. I would also like to build some dams, a dam against undue and unnecessary delays in judicial determination of cases, a dam against frivolous litigation and a dam against fake witnesses and false testimonies and would also try to retire a debt, the debt of pending cases which must be decided at the earliest possible.

I can anticipate that some of the steps to be taken in these areas may face some resistance or reluctance from those who are used to the old ways but I am sure that the results to be achieved will convince all concerned of utility and usefulness of such steps. I would like to assure you that all such steps will be taken in the best interests of the institution of judiciary and that in all manner of circumstances we shall like and prefer to be correct rather than erratic and proper rather than popular.

There are about 1.9 million cases pending in the country before all the courts put together and to handle such a huge number of cases there are only about 3000 Judges and Magistrates available from top to bottom.

Successive governments have failed to suitably increase the number of Judges and Magistrates on account of financial constraints.

3000 Judges and Magistrates cannot handle 1.9 million cases even if they work for 36 hours a day.

It is, therefore, time to take some big and hard decisions. It is also time to introduce some structural and systemic changes so as to minimize litigation, eliminate unnecessary delays and rationalize the workload. Time has also come when the judicial system as a whole needs to be redesigned or restructured and made simple and effective.

The four-tier judicial hierarchy in the country ought to be replaced with a three-tier system wherein there should be the District Judiciary as the trial court for all civil and criminal cases, the Provincial High Courts as the courts of appeal in all cases and the Supreme Court as the last resort.

All questions of fact must attain finality at the level of the High Court and the Supreme Court ought to attend only to interpretation of the Constitution and laws.

All the Special Courts ought to be abolished and there ought to be one hierarchy of courts with specified judges of the District Judiciary attending to cases under the special laws like drugs, banking, narcotics, corruption, terrorism, labour, intellectual property and consumer protection, etc. with appeals in such cases going to the High Courts. The special courts created under a Federal statute may be financed and administered by the Federal Government but they may fit into the same hierarchy. Having only one judicial hierarchy may eliminate jurisdictional disputes as well as the delay caused in resolving such disputes.

Military Courts trying civilians in criminal cases are universally perceived as an aberration propelled by necessity and expediency. If the legislature, in its own wisdom, decides to continue with such courts for the time being then it may consider providing for appeals from their decisions to lie before a High Court so as to adjust such courts in the normal judicial hierarchy and to ensure that expediency does not trump justice.

The already blurred distinction between Regular First Appeal, Regular Second Appeal, Revision petition and First Appeal against Order, etc. before the High Court ought to be done away with and in a three-tier judicial hierarchy a right of appeal may be provided against all orders or judgments of the trial court with a clear provision requiring the appeals against interim orders of the trial courts to be filed with an advance notice to the opposite party and such appeals may be finally decided within a few days.

Shorter formats of judgments and orders ought to be introduced so that time of the courts is not wasted in writing unnecessary details and, as far as possible, law clerks, research assistants and judgment writers may be provided to the judges at all levels so that their time may be saved in matters of research and drafting.

The constitutional jurisdiction of a High Court must be exercised within its prescribed limits and resort to it as a matter of course as the next available remedy has to be stopped or discouraged. For constitutional cases of national importance a Constitution Bench may be administratively carved out in this Court from within the strength of the Court keeping in view the seniority of the relevant Judges and reflecting the Federal character as far as practicable.

My colleagues and I would also want this Court to attend to many laws which are either unnecessary or their wrongful utilization is clogging the courts. It shall be suggested to the legislature that such unnecessary or problematic laws ought to be repealed or suitably amended and in case of failure of the legislature to attend to the said issue such laws may be judicially scrutinized. There are also some issues of public importance with reference to enforcement of fundamental rights of the citizens which have hitherto remained unattended and an effort shall be made to attend to those issues in all earnestness within the shortest possible time.

Suo motu exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution shall be exercised very sparingly and only in respect of larger issues of national importance where either there is no other adequate or efficacious remedy available or the available constitutional or legal remedies are ineffective or are rendered incapacitated.

Either through a Full Court meeting or through a judicial exercise an effort shall be made to determine and lay down the scope and parameters of exercise of the original jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution and, if deemed appropriate, to carve out the scope of an Intra-Court Appeal in such matters through an appropriate amendment of the Supreme Court Rules or to suitably amend the provisions relating to review jurisdiction so as to enlarge its scope in such cases.

I am conscious that the issues being faced by the justice sector are gigantic but I may assure you that no stone shall be left unturned in attending to such issues and in trying to improve the situation. With Baloch blood running in my veins I shall fight till the end and I am confident that with the support and cooperation of my colleagues and the Bar the struggle shall bear fruit.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let us admit that in the recent past there has been a trust deficit between different organs of the State and every organ has reasons for sticking to its declared position. There is no gainsaying that all the three organs of the State, i.e. the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive are always to strive hard for exercising their powers and performing their functions to the best of their abilities while maintaining their independence and operational autonomy but at the same time when it comes to steering the ship of the State and handling the larger national issues all such organs are to work in tandem in finding solutions which advance the spirit and purposes of the Constitution. The constitutional doctrine of separation of powers is sound and valid so far as the institutional and operational independence of every organ of the State is concerned but nothing in the said doctrine demands institutional isolation or forbids collective efforts to achieve common good. In my humble estimation time has come when we should put our heads together and in the spirit of truth and reconciliation discuss the larger issues jeopardizing good governance.

Let us discuss with open minds where the judiciary, the executive and the legislature have gone wrong in the past. Let us discuss where each other’s domain has been encroached upon in the past and try to resolve such issues through a mutually agreed course of action. Let us discuss the alleged encroachment of the executive domain by the judiciary through interference in matters of policy, the alleged excessive use of its constitutional jurisdiction in matters which are administrative in nature and how best the judiciary can return to its normal but effective adjudicatory role. Let us also discuss why the judiciary is struggling hard while trying to handle huge influx of cases and where the other organs of the State have so far failed to provide it the requisite support. Let us also discuss how the legislature can be restricted to its legislative domain and how the legislators can be held back to their legislative role rather than encroaching upon the executive domain through development funds and through interference in appointment, posting, transfer or promotion of public servants which is the main breeding ground for misuse of authority, corruption, lack of merit, inefficiency and the resultant bad governance. Let us discuss how the executive authorities and departments are to be kept operationally autonomous in administrative matters while implementing the policies of the political executive so as to ensure good governance. Let us also discuss, without mincing words or feeling shy, the role of the armed forces and the intelligence agencies in the governance paradigm. Civilian supremacy as well as civilian accountability are sine qua non for democratic sustainability. Let us deliberate how civilian supremacy can be ensured alongside civilian accountability without the process of accountability destabilizing democracy. And, let us not forget or fail to discuss the issue of missing persons and of enforced disappearances and their adverse impact upon the constitutional scheme of things as well as national cohesion. It needs to be realized and appreciated by all the stakeholders that statecraft is too serious a business to be reduced to a game of hide and seek and that in a constitutional democracy national security cannot be pursued by employing methods which are offensive to the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights to life and liberty. Instead of adopting a trigger-happy approach or a devil may care attitude on these delicate and sensitive issues we need to find solutions from within the Constitution and the law. Let us, therefore, sit together and discuss. Let us not keep drifting or floating aimlessly. Time has come to reflect upon the past, learn from the mistakes and to define the future course of action with clarity lest the rudderless ship may be swept away by the storm of unbridled emotions and selfish short-sightedness. Let us not shy away from all such critical issues or look the other way in careless abandon and let us catch the bull by its horns if we want to make any progress as a forward looking and democratic nation governed by a Constitution. Let us call a spade a spade, rise to the occasion and try to emulate our founding fathers in an effort to rebuild our nation on the foundations of freedom envisioned by our revered elders.

I would, therefore, with the approval and support of my colleagues, propose holding of an inter-institutional dialogue at the summit level and would request the worthy President of Pakistan to convene a meeting and to chair the deliberations. I am of the opinion that we have reached a stage in our national life where we must take stock of the mistakes committed in the past and to come up with a Charter of Governance so as to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in future. I would propose that such a summit may be attended by the top parliamentary leadership, the top judicial leadership and the top executive leadership including the military and the intelligence agencies. After bringing all such major stakeholders in the national governance on one table under the patronage of the President of Pakistan an effort should be made through such proposed exercise to heal the wounds of the past, attend to the sore points and work out a practicable policy framework whereunder every organ and institution of the State exercises its powers and performs its functions within its constitutionally defined limits. The sole purpose of the proposed exercise should be to bolster constitutionalism and rule of law, strengthen democracy and create an environment wherein the State and all its organs and institutions may be able to devote their wholehearted attention to the real issues of the citizens of this great country and, as envisaged in the Preamble to our Constitution, “So that the people of Pakistan may prosper and attain their rightful and honoured place amongst the nations of the World and make their full contribution towards international peace and progress and happiness of humanity”.

In the end, with fondest of memories and with every good wish I on my own behalf and also on behalf of all my colleagues bid farewell to our very dear friend, our illustrious colleague and our distinguished Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar. Sir, we shall all miss you on the Bench but at the same time all of us pray for your good health, long life and further fruitful contributions in diverse walks of life in the days to come.

",2019-01-17,"Over a period of more than 19 years, the judge has decided about 55,000 cases, including several high-profile ones.

Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, who will be sworn in as the 26th chief justice of Pakistan on Friday (January 18), was born on December 21, 1954 in Dera Ghazi Khan. He is married with two daughters and four grandchildren.

Justice Khosa's brothers are former bureaucrat Nasir Mahmood Khosa and former inspector general of police (IGP) of Balochistan Tariq Masood Khosa.

The judge, who is now 64 years old, received his undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Punjab and his LLM degree from Queens College at Cambridge in 1978.

Read: 'Suo motu notices to be taken sparingly,' says Justice Khosa

He enrolled as an advocate at the Lahore High Court in 1979, and then at the Supreme Court in 1985. As an advocate, he conducted over 600 cases. On February 18, 2010, Justice Khosa was elevated to the position of a Supreme Court judge.

Justice Khosa, over a period of more than 19-and-a-half years, has decided about 55,000 cases.

A special bench headed by Justice Khosa has decided over 10,000 cases of a criminal nature since 2014, according to an article published by The Express Tribune last year. “The total number of pending cases in the top court has reached near 40,000 and a few hundreds of criminal cases are left, which is being considered as a landmark achievement of the apex court,” the article read.

'Poetic justice'

Justice Khosa is known for adding lyrical flair in his observations and judgments — most recently in the landmark Panama papers verdict that de-seated Nawaz Sharif as the prime minister in 2017.

His dissenting note in the split 2:3 verdict — Khosa was among the two who held Nawaz should be disqualified — on April 20, 2017 began with a reference to the popular 1969 novel ‘The Godfather’ by Mario Puzo in which he pointed out an epigraph by Honore de Balzac selected by the author: ""Behind every great fortune there is a crime"", saying that ""It is ironical and a sheer coincidence that the present case revolves around that very sentence attributed to Balzac.""

The literary reference became a major talking point as opposition parties, in particular the PTI, latched onto it to drive home the allegations of corruption while PML-N spoke out against the choice of analogy.

Nawaz was subsequently disqualified under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution in July the same year.

Read Khosa's article, written when he was a barrister, critical of the ambiguity inherent in Articles 62 and 63 here.

In 2012, when a SC bench — headed by headed by Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk — slapped former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani with a contempt charge, Justice Khosa authored an additional note along with the detailed judgement which included an original rendition of Khalil Gibran’s poem 'Pity the nation'.

Justice Khosa was also part of two high-profile blasphemy-related cases; he headed the bench which upheld the conviction of Mumtaz Qadri in 2015 for the murder of former Punjab governor Salman Taseer and last year in October, he was part of the bench that acquitted Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy charges.

Justice Khosa’s razor-sharp critique of the prosecution case is combined with remarkable judicial prose — lawyer Faisal Siddiqi

A column written by lawyer Faisal Siddiqi published in Dawn on the verdict in the Aasia Bibi case noted:

""Justice Khosa’s razor-sharp critique of the prosecution case is combined with remarkable judicial prose, when he appears to regret the imprisonment of Aasia Bibi by holding that 'Blasphemy is a serious offence but the insult of the appellant’s [Aasia Bibi’s] religion and religious sensibilities by the complainant party and then mixing truth with falsehood … was also not short of being blasphemous … in the circumstances of the present case she appears to be a person, in the words of Shakespeare’s King Lear, ‘more sinned against than sinning’.""

Next in line

Justice Khosa has authored multiple books during his career, including 'Heeding the Constitution', 'Constitutional Apologues', and 'Judging with Passion and Breaking New Ground'.

He also edited and compiled ‘The Constitution of Pakistan, 1973’ with all amendments up to date.

The next in line to take reins of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Justice Khosa has previously served as the acting chief justice from June 5-11 in 2017, June 29 to July 5 in 2017, May 14-30 in 2018, and Dec 17-23 in 2018.

",2019-01-17,"Prime Minister Imran Khan in a tweet on Thursday asked why lawmakers were ""so scared"" of the Exit Control List (ECL) and why they were so keen to go abroad.

The tweet comes ahead of a federal cabinet meeting today, in which the removal of the name of PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari — among others — from the ECL is expected to be discussed, DawnNewsTV reported. According to Radio Pakistan, the cabinet meeting will also discuss the overall political and economic situation of the country.

""There is so much work to be done by politicians in and for Pakistan — the land they claim to love but some cannot wait to take frequent trips abroad and lawmakers have iqamas or residences abroad,"" Prime Minister Khan added in his tweet.

""Can anyone explain this strange phenomenon to those of us who would be quite happy to remain in and work for Pakistan because we actually love Pakistan,"" the premier asked in another tweet.

Shortly after, Bilawal replied to the premier on Twitter, saying: ""Obviously selected PM doesn't understand the concept of human rights or freedom of movement.""

""Funny it’s only the opposition members on ECL, government members are busy travelling. Including PM who despite promising not to travel for first six months has made more than seven trips so far!,"" the PPP chairman added.

On the recommendations of the joint investigation team (JIT) tasked with probing the fake accounts case, the federal cabinet had in its meeting on December 27, 2018 decided to place the names of 172 individuals — who were named in the investigation report — on the ECL, including Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Faryal Talpur, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Farooq H Naek and several other leaders and provincial ministers belonging to the PPP.

Last week, Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar had grilled the state prosecutor over why the government had decided to place names of Bilawal and the Sindh chief minister on the no-fly list based on JIT's recommendation, ordering the federal cabinet to reconsider its ""hasty decision"".

The government, however, had said it would wait for the court's written judgement.

During a National Assembly session on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi regretted that the government had shown haste in placing the names of 172 people on the ECL.

Attempting to placate the PPP, Qureshi said that the matter was discussed in a federal cabinet meeting and the government had decided to wait until the detailed verdict is released.

According to Qureshi, the top court had ordered the government to consider the removal of the travel ban, not to take the names off the list immediately.

Later in the day on Wednesday, the Supreme Court finally released its order pertaining to the removal of the names of Bilawal as well as Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah from ECL, noting: ""Removing of the names will not prevent NAB [National Accountability Bureau] to probe and in case sufficient material is found connecting these individuals with cognisable offences, it will not be precluded from making an appropriate request to the federal government to place their names on [the] ECL again or take any appropriate action provided by law.""",dawn,Dawn,Politics,"ECL, Bilawal Bhutto, Supreme Court, Imran Khan",1

",2019-01-17,"A full court reference in honour of the retiring Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mian Saqib Nisar, was held in Court No. 1 of the Supreme Court on Thursday.

The ceremony in Islamabad was attended by all Supreme Court judges — with the exception of Justice Mansoor Ali Shah — as well as Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Anwar Mansoor, Vice Chairman of Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) Kamran Murtaza, retired senior judges as well as senior journalists, among others. Justice Nisar's family was also in attendance.

While addressing the gathering, Justice Nisar said the top court has passed many landmark verdicts. ""First is the Gilgit-Baltistan's verdict.""

""Supreme Court took notice of the scarcity of water in the country. The entire nation gave donations to solve the crisis. Second issue the court picked up was that of population growth,"" he said.

""[Judiciary] worked for the rights of the downtrodden, granted overseas Pakistanis the right to vote and gave every person the right to live with dignity. Court also took notice of private hospital charges, issuance of national identity cards by National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to transgenders.

""The court also took notice of Tayyaba torture case as well as the issue of children working as domestic servants.

""[I] tried to return the respect given by the people and tried to solve the issues plaguing sectors of health and education, both of which are rights granted to citizens by the Constitution.

""The role of a judge is never easy, I am aware that the decisions we make shape not just the day to day lives of individuals, but have the potential to mould the lives of generations to come.

""Fear has no place in a judge’s life, nor does the fear of opposition bring so much as a wrinkle on his forehead, for his only duty is to the Constitution and the people for whom he stands as a beacon of justice

""I worked within the code of conduct for judges and it has been my honour to have served the nation.""

The CJP thanked his fellow judges; ""those who have laid down their robes and those who grace the bench with me today, for always extending their unqualified support to me in all my efforts in dispensing justice and for working tirelessly round the clock"".

""I am also grateful to the employees of the Supreme Court and particularly each and every member of my staff, all of whom have invested long hours with me.

""I am highly indebted to my beautiful family [...] I would not be here today if it were not for you all.""

'Suo motu notices to be taken sparingly'

Addressing the full court reference, chief justice-designate Justice Asif Saeed Khosa said that he had been working alongside Justice Nisar for 20 years but will now have to part ways as per the law.

He said that the outgoing chief justice had faced many constitutional, societal and political challenges during his tenure and headed the judiciary in ""very difficult circumstances"".

Justice Nisar's services for humanitarian causes will be remembered, he added.

Read the full text of Justice Khosa's address here.

Outlining his plan for his upcoming tenure as top judge, Justice Khosa said that he will ensure the quick dispensation of justice.

Referring to Justice Nisar's efforts to raise donations to build the Diamer-Bhasha dams, Justice Khosa said that he too he wanted to build a dam.

""Mian Sahib had once observed publically that he is left with only two ambitions in life, i.e. to build dams and to retire the national debt.

""I would also like to build some dams, a dam against undue and unnecessary delays in judicial determination of cases, a dam against frivolous litigation and a dam against fake witnesses and false testimonies and would also try to retire a debt, the debt of pending cases which must be decided at the earliest possible.

""Currently there are 1.9 million cases pending in courts. Three thousand judges cannot dispense of so many cases,"" Justice Khosa noted.

""The power to take suo motu notices will be used sparingly,"" said the incoming CJP, ""and only in respect of larger issues of national importance where either there is no other adequate or efficacious remedy available or the available constitutional or legal remedies are ineffective or are rendered incapacitated"".

Speaking on the role of other courts, the SC judge said: ""The trial of a civilian in a military court is considered wrong across the world. It is said that military courts take less time to issue verdicts. Civilian courts should try to resolve cases in a short period of time. High courts should exercise powers within their jurisdiction.""

""When has the judiciary interfered in the matters of other institutions?"" Justice Khosa asked. ""Army and intelligence agencies should not interfere in civilian matters.""

""The job of the parliament is to legislate, not provide development funds. Transfers and postings are not among the parliament's duties either.""

PBC's Vice Chairman Murtaza, while speaking at the ceremony, said that Justice Nisar had availed the authority granted to judiciary under Article 184(3) (Original jurisdiction of Supreme Court). Murtaza said that while he was one of the opponents of Article 184(3), he had no doubts about the intentions of Justice Nisar. However, Murtaza said, the ""matter of Article 184(3)'s limitations must be resolved"".

Murtaza lauded Justice Nisar's ""extraordinary"" service as chief justice and wondered if the Supreme Court, as an institution, would be able to continue performing in a similar manner. He stressed the need for the introduction of institutional reforms.

""Chief Justice Saqib Nisar is a very capable person,"" Murtaza declared.

President of Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Amanullah Kanrani also addressed the ceremony and said that recently ""the judges' tone has become so harsh that it distracts the court and lawyers from their basic purpose"".

""Lawyers are not given a chance to present facts and arguments,"" he said. He further said that the ""huge amount of suo motu cases"" leads to a delay in the proceedings of other petitions. Kanrani also suggested that the appellants be allowed to appeal against the verdicts passed in suo motu cases.

The SCBA president also said that ""informal remarks"" passed by judges and lawyers during court proceedings affect the ""minds of petitioners"". Kanrani insisted that there was a need to hold judges accountable.

Justice Nisar's legacy

Justice Nisar was sworn in as the top judge on Dec 31, 2016. After he hangs up his robes today, Justice Khosa will take over the reins of the Supreme Court of Pakistan tomorrow when he will be administered the oath by President Arif Alvi.

Earlier in the day, after adjourning a hearing of his last case, Justice Nisar said he was ""thankful to everyone"".

""I spent more than 20 years in judiciary. I always tried to issue verdicts in accordance with the law and regulations,"" he said.

Among Justice Nisar's retirement plans are to open a ""free legal clinic"". ""I will offer free legal assistance to the oppressed, poor and helpless people at my free legal clinic,"" he had disclosed, stressing that the country belongs to the disadvantaged populace as much as it does to those from the more privileged sections of society.

Herald's 'Person of the Year 2018': Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, for judging too much

The outgoing chief justice passed several landmark judgements during his tenure as top judge — including the verdict in the Aasia Bibi case last year. He also headed the bench which decided that disqualification handed down under Article 62 (1)(f) of the Constitution would be for life.

The defining feature of his tenure, however, may be his judicial activism and frequent suo motu notices. Justice Nisar created headlines not just in the courtrooms, but by visits all over the country — to hospitals, filtration plants, lower court rooms and even prisons. Everywhere that the chief justice went, the cameras followed.

He also set up a fund for the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and initiated a campaign to raise awareness about population control.

At the full court reference that was held for his predecessor, former chief justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali, Justice Nisar in his address — which many believed was an insight into his plan of action as top judge — had declared that the judiciary will not tolerate corruption in any form.

Take a look: In search of a legacy

“The act of corruption by state actors is a complete fraud on the exercise of their power may it be the executive or judicial limbs of the state,” Justice Nisar had observed and cautioned that it should be very clearly understood that besides cleaning ‘‘our own house of corruption, the judiciary would play its role in the eradication of corruption from other limbs of the government’’.

Justice Nisar's judicial career

Justice Nisar has been a judge of the apex court since Feb 18, 2010. Before that he was a judge of the Lahore High Court (LHC).

Before being appointed as a judge, he was member of the Supreme Court Bar Associa­tion and Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA). He was elected as secretary general of the LHCBA in 1991.

Explore: Judicial overreach?

Born on Jan 18, 1954, in Lahore, Justice Nisar did his matriculation from the Cath­edral High School, Lahore, graduation from the Gover­n­ment College, Lahore, and bac­h­elor of law from the Uni­versity of Punjab in 1979-80.

He joined the legal profession as an advocate on May 2, 1980. He was enrolled as an advocate of the high court in 1982 and advocate of the Supreme Court in 1994.

He was elevated as the judge of the high court on May 22, 1998, and of the Supreme Court on Feb 18, 2010.

Justice Nisar specialised in civil, commercial, tax and constitutional laws and appeared in a large number of important constitutional cases both in the LHC and the Supreme Court.

He was appointed as the federal law secretary on March 29, 1997, when he became the first member of the bar to be appointed to the important position.

Justice Nisar represented Pakistan in an international conference held at the Wilton Park, United Kingdom, on the subject of “Pakistan and India at Fifty”.

He led a Pakistani delegation to a conference in Manila on the subject of “Asia Region Transitional Crimes”. He also attended conferences in Switzerland and Norway.

He had also been a part-time lecturer at the Punjab Law College and Pakistan College of Law, where he taught civil procedure code and the Constitution.",dawn | Haseeb Bhatti,Dawn,Judiciary,"Supreme Court, Saqib Nisar, Suo moto, Asif Khosa",1

",2019-01-17,"“I don’t feel like I’m in another country. Pakistanis have given me so much love. I’m overwhelmed. I feel very lucky.”

This is how Indian actress Aditi Singh expressed herself at a press meet held at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday evening.

Ms Singh, who has worked in Pakistani film Wajood directed by Javed Sheikh, said she feels fortunate to have been asked to come to the press club. She was also happy that Pakistani actress Meera had accompanied her to the presser. Meera was the one who, when she first saw her in Wajood, had remarked that Javed Sheikh had cast a doll-like girl in his film.

Ms Singh said whatever she has achieved as an actress so far is because of the media and the way it has encouraged her presence in Pakistan. “Artists are nothing without the media’s support.”

Cast of Wajood.

Ms Singh told journalists that her maternal uncle, actor Aditya Pancholi, had told her that she would get a lot of love from Pakistan just as he did. It’s true. She has not yet felt that she’s not in her own house [country]. She is overwhelmed by the love that Pakistanis have given her. There are so many families here who have made her a member of their households.

Answering a question whether there are any technical differences between working in Indian and Pakistani films, she replied there’s none. The Pakistani industry is growing a lot, though the pace is slow. Pakistani media’s future is bright. The content being used here is of high quality. Responding to a query, she said she’d like to work with Pakistani artists Ali Zafar, Hamza Ali Abbasi and Meera.

Ms Singh began her film career with a Telugu film Guppedanth Prem and went on to do another Telugu movie Nenu Kidnap Iyanu before coming to Pakistan.

Prior to her address, Meera read out a speech (though earlier journalists were told that she’s going to play a recorded message because she wasn’t feeling well). She welcomed Ms Singh to the club and thanked the Pakistan Film TV Journalists Association for arranging the event.

Ms Meera said the club had gathered ambassadors of two countries under one roof. Though the countries had different borders, their people love each other. Borders could be far from each other but not the hearts of the people. There are a number of political and ideological differences between India and Pakistan, but when it comes to culture and the film industry, art is not confined to borders. Heads of state require formal invitations to visit one another’s countries, not the artist community. Artists cannot be stopped by foreign policy to cross into another country. The only thing that artists look for is love.

Ms Meera said she recently met Indian actor Sonu Sood in Dubai. He expressed his desire to come to Pakistan and wished that Meera’s upcoming film Baji is released in India. She also met Poonam Dhillon, who too wants to visit Pakistan.

The office bearers (Imtiaz Faran, Arman Sabir, Raja Kamran) and some members of the governing body of the Karachi Press Club formally welcomed the two guests. Wasi Qureshi conducted the programme.

",2019-01-17,"KHIZAR Hayat did not know how close he came to death this past weekend. It’s not as if nobody told him. He just cannot understand what an execution is.

In fact, even though he has been on death row since 2003, he does not know why he is in jail. The anti-psychotic medication he has been on has proven to be less and less effective with each passing year. Solitary confinement has only made his condition worse.

On Friday, Jan 11, the government of Pakistan issued Khizar’s execution warrant. He would be executed before sunrise on Jan 15. His mother, Iqbal Bano, was inconsolable. This is, unfortunately, not the first time Iqbal Bano has been dragged through this ordeal. Khizar was issued two execution warrants in 2015, one in 2017, and was about to earn the macabre status of being Pakistan’s first execution of 2019.

The Imdad Ali case: Why executing a mental patient is severely problematic

Every single one of those execution orders directly contravenes Pakistan’s international human rights obligations, domestic laws and expert medical opinion.

So why do they keep getting issued?

On death row since 2003, Khizar does not know why he is in jail.

In April 2016, before he was chief justice, Justice Saqib Nisar told a room full of psychiatrists that the laws must be tightened to protect the mentally ill.

But in the same year, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of Imdad Ali, another death-row prisoner with a severe mental disability on the premise that schizophrenia is “not a mental illness”. Criticism stemming from the public’s more straightforward conception of mental illness saved Imdad’s life at the eleventh hour.

In May 2017, Justice Umar Ata Bandial also stated at a conference that it would “be unfair to punish the mentally ill”.

These were encouraging indicators that perhaps, finally, it was being recognised that mentally ill defendants lack the criminal intent to warrant the same punishment as the mentally able.

In April 2018, Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, while hearing the cases of Kanizan Bibi and Imdad Ali, made headlines across Pakistan by categorically ruling out execution for prisoners with mental disabilities. “Beyond sense or reason,” he rightly declared in open court, “that we hang the mentally ill.” He immediately ordered that Kanizan be transferred to a secure mental health facility to get the treatment she needs. Fresh medical reviews have been ordered for both, and the case has been dubbed “precedent-setting” for the rights of the mentally disabled.

While these two cases remain pending before the Supreme Court, in December 2018, the Lahore High Court dismissed a petition seeking Khizar’s transfer to a mental health facility. It stated that “emotional disorders of like nature were not viewed as factors sufficient enough to impede execution”. Not only did this clear the pathway to Khizar’s execution but also exposed demonstrably mentally ill prisoners like Kanizan, Imdad and Saleem to the same fate.

Luckily, the National Commission on Human Rights was quick to act. It issued an order restraining the relevant authorities from scheduling Khizar’s hanging until the matter is decided by the Supreme Court. Jail authorities were not only copied in the order that was issued, they were also present at the hearing. They were party to the statements. They cannot claim ignorance.

The government of Pakistan should use this case as an opportunity for introspection. When the jury was, quite literally, still out on the matter of mentally ill prisoners — how could the lower courts so openly disregard the Supreme Court? How were the orders of the Pakistani government’s foremost human rights body defied so blatantly by jail authorities?

This breakdown of communications can prove to be deadly. Had the campaign mobilised by Justice Project Pakistan not caught the attention of the chief justice, had voices of influence not been moved enough to amplify their platforms and privilege, had the deluge of appeals to the president to accept his appeal for clemency stemmed, Khizar would have been a dead man by now.

Every prisoner with a history of mental illness should have their sentences commuted without delay. This is the very least that Pakistan’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights demand.

President Arif Alvi has Khizar’s mercy petition before him. It contains details of his mental illness, the laws that confirm that his execution would be wrongful, as well as a reminder of Pakistan’s international commitments. It makes for a useful and life-saving document.

The right to seek pardon belongs to the people. It is not just a private act of grace but a meaningful safeguard against any mistakes that might have been made during sentencing. And in Khizar’s case, it is exactly what justice looks like.

",2019-01-17,"GILGIT: Senator Talha Mahmood claimed to set a record by hunting an ibex with 54 inches horns in Passu valley of Hunza district here on Tuesday.

The lawmaker, who was accompanied by a local guide in the expedition, told reporters that Gilgit-Baltistan had the largest wildlife habitat in Asia and therefore, it could attract foreigners in large numbers for lawful hunting.

The wildlife department officials said Senator Talha had obtained the trophy hunting licence by paying the permit fee to the GB government for hunting ibex.

They said the lawmaker had been hunting animals in GB for the five years.

GB conservator (wildlife and parks) Yaqoob Ali Khan said more than 40 wildlife species had so far been hunted in the region under the 2018-19 trophy hunting programme.

He said people from within the country and the US and Europe got hunting permits.

The official said the wildlife department had auctioned the hunting licence in Oct last year under the 2018-19 trophy hunting programme.

He said the wildlife department was doing its best to check illegal hunting across the region despite being short staffed.

Information minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai later told reporters that around 30,000 posts of different departments and attached directorates had been lying vacant in seven merged districts.

He said it had been decided to fill 15,000 posts, including 6,000 for police personnel.

The minister said priority for those jobs would be given to local residents. He said officers of the police would also be deployed in seven merged districts to perform their duties along with Levies and Khasadar.

Mr Yousafzai said all relevant departments had been directed to expedite development activities in different sectors, while the timeline of three months had been set for the execution of all schemes to ensure early implementation of projects.

He said the departments and directorates would inform the relevant authorities about vacant posts so that they could be filled within the stipulated period.

The minister said process for holding local government elections in the region was also discussed.

He said the government wanted to hold the local body elections in seven tribal districts before elections for the KP Assembly there.

Mr Yousafzai said the delimitation process had been completed and that the government would ask the Election Commission of Pakistan to announce date for local government polls in the area.

He said the relevant department had been directed to install solar panels in 300 mosques of the region within three months.

The minister said 16 grid stations would be upgraded, while work on 10MW hydel power generation unit in Kurram district would begin very soon.

He said municipal services would be extended to 25 tehsils by March 31.

Mr Yousafzai said the government had accorded top priority to the development of education and health sectors with missing facilities being provided to educational institutions and health centres.

Advisor to the chief minister on education Ziaullah Bangash said budget for the education sector totaled Rs18 billion, including Rs4 billion for the development side.

He said the board of governors for the governor’s model schools would be changed with the immediate priority of the department being the resolution of the issue of attendance in schools.

Mr Bangash said the directorate of education for seven tribal districts had been merged with the province, while the independent monitoring units had begun working in the region to find out missing facilities in schools besides ensuring presence of teachers on duty.

The information minister said the facility of Sehat Insaf Card would be extended to all tribal districts with half of the million families getting cards.

He said the distribution of those cards would begin on Jan 31.

He said the Sports Gala would be organised in tribal districts in Feb, while cultural festivals would be held there in the same month.

",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: After being censured by the Supreme Court (SC) the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has taken over possession of 237 kanals from locals of Chattha Bakhtawar for the construction of the King Hamad Nursing University.

CDA had acquired over 900 kanals in Chattha Bakhtawar in 1981 but there was a dispute between locals and the civic agency regarding the compensation amount.

Due to this dispute, the civic agency was unable to get possession of the land. But some years ago, when King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain had announced funding for a nursing university, the CDA had allotted 237 kanals to the health ministry for the construction of the varsity even though it did not have possession of the said land.

Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had in Jan 2017 laid the foundation stone of the university but construction work could not be started due to the compensation dispute.

SC had recently reprimanded CDA officers for the civic agency’s failure in taking possession of the land and made directions that it should ensure possession.

The civic agency on Wednesday conducted an operation and handed over the land to the health ministry after getting possession. The health ministry will start construction work in collaboration with the government of Bahrain.

CDA spokesperson Syed Safdar Ali said that 15 built-up-properties (BUP) were demolished during the operation and that 17 families were given allotment letters for alternative plots in compensation for their demolished BUPs.

He said CDA had also made arrangements to pay compensation on the spot and that cheques were distributed among the people from whom the land was acquired.

“The process was completed amicably and with no untoward incident,” he said, adding that after vacation, the land was handed over to the concerned department.

A camp office has been established at the site for the facilitation of locals whose land has been acquired.

Sources said that CDA had decided to give an 8pc increase in the rate of land per annum from the date of the award announced in 1981 to get possession of the over 900 kanals.

The sources also said that according to the CDA Ordinance of 1960, the civic agency could not give an 8pc increase as it did not get possession of the land.

Clause 32-A of the 1960 ordinance says, “Payment of additional compensation: When the amount of the compensation determined under section 29 and sub section (3) of section 30 is not paid or deposited with the deputy commissioner shall, in addition to such compensation, pay additional compensation computed at the rate of eight per centum per annum on such compensation from the time of so taking the possession until it has been so paid or deposited”.

However, sources said the step was taken as it would have been unfair to compensate locals in 2019 at the rate in vogue in 1981.

CDA Deputy Commissioner Qazi Shoaib said cases related to the Chatta Bakhtawar award had been in litigation in various courts for years.

“So we decided to amicably resolve it,” he said, and that an 8pc per annum amount is justified with the current market rate.

The land award was announced in 1981 but after 35 years, the CDA announced a controversial BUP award in 2016, saying that 782 people were eligible for an initial BUP award.

The National Accountability Bureau is currently conducting an investigation into bogus BUP awards.

",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: With the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) saying it needs six months to determine the law under which to file a reference, a subcommittee of the Public Accounts Committee has decided in principle to carry out a forensic audit of the Islamabad International Airport.

The subcommittee, which is led by PTI MNA Syed Fakhar Imam, has also directed the auditor general to determine whether delays in the project were caused by the contractor or the government.

The audit department has said it is quite capable of carrying out the audit as it is already auditing a private firm on Supreme Court orders, but would officially consent after a week.

NAB tells subcommittee it needs six months to determine the law under which to file a reference

While discussing delays in the escalation in cost for the airport from Rs37 billion to Rs105bn, the subcommittee was informed that the PAC has already referred some audit objections to NAB. However, a NAB official said the bureau would need six months to determine under which law it should file its reference, for which it will also consult with law experts at universities.

PML-N MNA Rana Tanveer Hussain said the six month wait would be too long, adding: “When you want to file references or take action against politicians you don’t even take a month to do it.”

Pakistan Engineering Council Chairman Jawed Salim Qureshi intervened in the discussion and said that in other countries, forensic audits are used to fix responsibility in such cases.

He added that here, government departments “ try to accept responsibility to protect the contractor from fines”.

Forensic audits investigate why a project was delayed and who was responsible, he said, adding: “It is inquired from the government department if it asked the contractor why the project was delayed and what the contractor’s reply was.”

Mr Qureshi also alleged that the project cost was deliberately stated to be Rs37bn instead of Rs81bn so “small and incompetent companies would be able to win the contract”.

Audit Works (Federal)Director General Mohammad Azhar told the subcommittee earlier that four inquiries have been conducted over delays in the completion of the airport.

“The ground-breaking of the project was held on April 7, 2007, and the project had to be completed within 30 months. However, at the time of the ground-breaking ceremony, the design of the project was not ready and even the PC-I was not approved. Even after 18 months, work on the runway was done again as work done at the time of the ground-breaking was destroyed,” he said.

Mr Azhar said that while the initial cost of the project was Rs37bn, a Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) report had revealed that a number of components were not included in the project. The realistic cost of the project, he said, was Rs81bn.

“However even that price escalated and reached over Rs105bn. We have raised a number of objections and even the FIA report shows that our objections were correct,” he said.

An Aviation Division official attributed the increase in cost to the decision to upgrade technology, and the foreign exchange conversion rate.

The official said the SC took note of the issue in September 2013, after which retired Lt Gen Shahid Nawaz carried out an inquiry and a review committee, headed by Shamsul Mulk, also looked into the matter.

The IIA project was conceived of in 1984, and the procurement of land near Fateh Jang began the same year. Land was bought for Rs30,000 per kanal to Rs500,000 per kanal, averaging Rs70,000 per kanal.

A stone-laying ceremony was held in 2004, and construction began without the approval of any design. Construction projects were also awarded at the same time to 17 contractors.

The initial Rs37bn PC-I was approved in 2008, which did not include the fuel system, radar and radio control building, aprons for planes, sewerage treatment plant, electricity or the availability of water.

In order to resolve the issue of water availability, it was decided to build two dams – Ramma and Kassana – at a cost of approximately Rs1.7bn to provide 3.3 million gallons of water per day.

In a statement, the paramilitary force called them attempts to defame the Rangers’ personnel, propagating fake news of raiding Lohar’s house and arresting her brother Singhar Lohar.

It was alleged that a Rangers’ team raided her house and took away her 17-year-old brother. Soon after the alleged raid, a number of civil society and nationalist activists held a protest demonstration at Shaheed Chowk in Khipro town of Sanghar district.

The statement, however, added that VMPS representatives uploaded a “fake” video of the alleged raid on social media platforms on Jan 12, while the news also appeared on Jan 15. The paramilitary force said that the Rangers did not carry out any raid on Lohar’s residence nor did any personnel harass her family.

As for the video circulated on social media, the Rangers said the mobile van seen in the footage was dispatched to Shumail Complex, near Mausamiyat [Karachi], on Jan 12 to arrest a suspect named Khalid Zaman.

“This is a serious matter and must be handled seriously,” he said and added that whenever he met parents they urged him to take strict action against peddling of narcotics in educational institutions.

“I am quite concerned about our children, who are the future of Pakistan and we have to bring them up in a safe, secure and healthy atmosphere,” he said.

He also directed the education secretary to develop coordination between private educational institution administrations and the police and also involve parents in the matter, if necessary, to develop a mechanism to stop narcotics peddling in educational institutions.

‘Most private security guards are untrained, which is dangerous’

The chief minister, presiding over a weekly meeting on law and order here at the CM House on Wednesday, also directed the home secretary to issue instructions to all security companies to get verification of their guards.

“I want security audit of all the guards employed by security agencies,” he said and added that apart from verification of their personnel, their weapons must be inspected.

“I have noticed that most of the private security guards are untrained which is dangerous,” he said and highlighted the need for making police training centres more professional for the training of new recruits and in-service training.

He also referred to two upcoming important events — PSL and multinational ‘Naval AMAN’ exercise — where the police had to provide security, therefore necessary meetings with the quarters concerned must be organised.

Operation against drug mafia

Earlier, DIG South Sharjeel Kharal told the chief minister that he had arrested a key suspect involved in developing a group to smuggle narcotics into educational institutions. IGP Kaleem Imam said that on the instructions of the chief minister the police had already launched a targeted operation against the drug mafia and had busted different gangs.

Explaining progress on implementation of the decisions taken in last week’s meeting on law and order, the DIG said he had held meetings with the DHA authorities for the installation of more CCTV cameras and fixing the faulty ones. Street lights in the DHA and Clifton areas were being improved and upgraded, he added.

The IGP told the chief minister that the culprits of the Chinese consulate attack had been arrested. Additional IG of the CTD Dr Waliullah Dal and CTD DIG Abdullah Shaikh briefed the chief minister on busting a gang involved in making fake arms licences even of banned bores.

IGP Imam said that on the lead given by the arrested suspects (involved in making fake licences) their facilitators in the police department and DC offices had also been taken into custody.

Steps to curb street crime

DIG East Amir Farooqui and DIG West Amin Yousafzai briefed the chief minister on the steps taken by them to curb street crime.

The IG police said that he had created a special force of 10 to 20 well-trained policemen being stationed at the SSP offices so that they could be called in case of any eventuality. The first batch of the force had been posted in the South zone in the first phase and in the second phase this deployment would be made in other zones. This initiative has been made after the attack on the Chinese consulate when police force was called from different police stations.

The IGP told the chief minister that he was preparing a mechanism to start police recruitment round the year as “over 10,000 policemen retire from service every year, therefore recruitment process as approved by the chief minister was being started”.

Speaking to reporters after visiting production unit of an automobile company at Port Qasim, the federal minister was confident about the change in Sindh and “bleak” political future of the PPP in the province.

“The future of PPP in Sindh is no different from Pakistan Muslim League-N’s in Punjab,” he replied to a question.

“So the change is imminent here in Sindh and in democracy it comes through constitution and defined rules. The theory of governor rule is out of the question; it’s not possible in current scenario of parliamentary and democratic rule.”

Responding to a question, he said Prime Minister Imran Khan had met Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan leaders in Islamabad where they discussed the proposed measures for Karachi in the upcoming mini-budget to be announced on Jan 23.

“The MQM is our key partner and for development of Karachi we both would devise a joint strategy. As an immediate measure, we have decided to activate the federally-administered Karachi Infrastructure Development Company for different projects. The people of Karachi would soon see positive outcome of this partnership between the two parties,” added the federal minister.

",2019-01-17,"KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Wednesday spoke on the issues afflicting Sindh because of persistent water shortages as the provincial assembly passed a motion asking the Sindh government to approach the Centre for judicious water distribution among all federating units.

An extensive debate was held during the Sindh Assembly session, chaired by Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani, on an adjournment motion moved by Pakistan Peoples Party’s Heer Soho to discuss the role of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) in distributing water among the provinces in the light of the 1991 Accord — an agreement signed by then chief minister Jam Sadiq Ali.

A number of members of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which rules Islamabad, were present in the house, but they opted not to participate in the debate.

Murad Ali Shah questions PTI lawmakers’ sincerity with Sindh

No participation from PTI in debate

Chief Minister Shah did not hide his anguish on the silence of the PTI members who sat idle while everyone else spoke and expressed their anger against Irsa’s attitude towards Sindh.

“Not a single member of a big political party took part in this debate, which reflects how sincere they are with Sindh,” said a displeased Shah. “They should have spoken here; no matter against or for our stance. But, they vanished from the scene on such an important issue for Sindh.”

He also indicated the absence of the parliamentary party leader of the PTI who spoke extensively earlier during a calling-attention notice, but preferred not to be in the house today.

Mr Shah gave a detailed background about the water woes of Sindh, which, according to him originally begin in 1859. He said it was not just the Indus, but Sindh would get water from five other rivers as well.

He said the colonial rulers rejected the Greater Thal Canal scheme twice; yet, it was constructed during a dictator’s regime.

Despite British rulers’ actions against Sindh, he added, they chalked out and enforced an agreement after the construction of the Sukkur Barrage in which Sindh’s share was 48.74 million acre feet, which was still greater than Punjab’s 48.33MAF share then.

He said everyone had technically approved that agreement. However, after Partition, India stopped water to the then western wing of Pakistan forcing the newly created state to get its water by payment to India.

He said no expert was taken from Sindh and all of them belonged to the neighbouring province when Pakistan signed the Indus Basin Water Treaty in September 1960 and “sold” three of its rivers to India.

Too little water released downstream Kotri

“Such a treaty soon created problems; then, those at the helm decided why just Sindh take benefit from Indus and dams were constructed on the river. That was the time when problems for Sindh in getting its share of water got worse.”

He said instead of minimum 10MAF, just 2MAF water was allowed downstream Kotri this season. “Do you want to make the people of the lower riparian die of hunger and thirst?”

Mr Shah said even the 1991 Accord promised a separate share of water for Karachi, yet it was not being given.

He said Sindh was the province whose share was negligibly increased in contrast to Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan in the 1991 Accord. However, that share was never given to the province, he added.

He appreciated Balochistan for supporting Sindh’s case, saying he had contacted the chief ministers of Punjab and KP requesting them to help Sindh in getting justice.

Mr Shah said upon his efforts, the Council of Common Interests had formed a committee to resolve the water issue. The committee had met twice and its report was still awaited, he said.

He said Sindh was concentrating on the theme of conservation of water by lining the canals to make best use of the water available to the province.

Kalabagh dam termed a dead horse

He said there was a deficit of trust regarding the issue of the Kalabagh dam and appreciated an opposition member for highlighting conspiracies to give a new lease of life to the “dead horse” as the project was generally termed.

Ms Soho said Sindh was enduring agonising water shortages for years while the federal government was not ready to discuss the issue with the provincial government.

She accused Irsa of not making judicious distribution of water and demanded that the existing Irsa committee be dissolved and the federal nominee on the authority be taken from Sindh for being lower riparian in the new set-up.

Grand Democratic Alliance’s Nand Kumar said instead of passing resolutions and motions the government should evolve a mechanism, which can ensure that the issue gets resolved.

He said he smelled a conspiracy behind creation of water problems with Sindh by which “they try to revive the dead horse. But, I make it clear here that we’ll not allow you to construct the Kalabagh dam”.

PPP’s Aziz Narejo said shortage of water was 50 per cent at Sindh’s barrages, which multiplied miserably as water flowed downstream.

GDA’s Nusrat Sehar Abbasi said Sindh had not presented its case effectively. She echoed her colleague that conspiracies were on to revive the Kalabagh dam.

Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s Abdul Rasheed said instead of resolving such important issues, federal ministers were visiting Sindh only for engineering the provincial government’s collapse.

Mohammad Qasim of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan said: “It is not failure, but it is planned ignorance and hooliganism on the part of Irsa for not giving Sindh’s due share of water”.

Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s Jawed Hanif said Irsa distributed what it had in the system. He said it was time to stop wastage of water and make irrigation system efficient.

PPP’s Hina Dastagir said the federal government was taking measures to open gates for the Kalabagh dam. She said Punjab had never protested on the water issue because it had always benefited from the formula. She said Sindh’s deltaic region had been destroyed immensely.

Later, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Chawla tabled a motion in the house asking the provincial government to approach the Centre for getting Irsa to fairly regulate water distribution among the provinces.

",2019-01-17,"RAWALPINDI: Express­ing concern over the presence of a large number of Afghans living in Pakistan, the government has directed the law enforcement agencies to ensure strict vigilance and security till the repatriation process is completed.

The issue of Afghans living in Pakistan and their repatriation was discussed at a meeting held in Islamabad recently. Senior officials of the federal government and intelligence agencies attended the meeting.

The meeting was informed that the presence of a large number of Afghans (registered and unregistered) in Pakistan was a point of concern for law enforcement agencies. The officials were of the view that although the number of unregistered refugees was collated by the police through FIRs registered, there was a need to chalk out a comprehensive strategy at the national level for their repatriation.

Officials say there are many unregistered Afghans who have obtained Pakistani identity documents using illegal means

It was also pointed out that majority of the Afghan settlers were not willing to return and so a clear-cut policy might be devised for their early repatriation. The law enforcement agencies officials said that there was an urgent need to develop a mechanism for re-verification of Afghan refugees through biometric systems as 32 per cent of them were living in camps but the remaining 68pc were living outside camps.

The intelligence officials said that there were many unregistered Afghans who had settled in Pakistan and obtained Pakistani identity documents using illegal means. They suggested that till completion of the repatriation, the security around the refugees must be ensured to avoid any untoward incident.

The meeting asked the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions to share data of the total number of Afghans living in Pakistan and directed law enforcement agencies to ensure strict vigilance and security till the completion of the process.

Meanwhile, the Punjab government recently chalked out standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the security of foreigners, especially Chinese.

It was observed by the law enforcement agencies that foreigners were visiting sensitive locations without acquiring no objection certificate (NOC) from intelligence agencies concerned and provincial and district governments.

The fresh guideline was given to all divisional police chiefs and commissioners and suggested that all foreigners shall report their dep­arture and arrival details.

In line with the fresh SOP, computerised database and biometric record of each foreigner living or working in the area of jurisdiction of police will be maintained and the record will be tallied with the Federal Investigation Agency’s records.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had produced Mr Rafique before the court of Justice Muhammad Bashir, seeking transit remand for five days.

When asked for how many days the National Assembly session would last, the court was informed that the session might continue for over five days and so it was likely that the court would be requested to extend the transit remand further. The court approved the request.

It is worth mentioning that Mr Rafique — who is in NAB’s custody in the Paragon Housing scam case — was shifted from Lahore to Islamabad last week as his production orders were issued by the National Assembly speaker.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Rafique said that whether under martial law or civil government, the term accountability was used but it was never genuinely implemented in the country. He suggested that the system of accountability should be revamped.

Replying to a question, he said that credit for the alliance of opposition parties went to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s “childish” approach.

“The government is non-serious and it cannot run the country. The coalition of opposition parties is the need of the hour as a joint opposition would be able to give tough time and force the government to perform,” he said.

",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: A special committee constituted by the Supreme Court in the case involving death of 10-year-old Amal Umer in Karachi has recommended that police personnel engaged in patrolling to control street crimes should not carry sub-machine guns (SMGs), rather pistols or handguns.

Read: How the system failed us

A three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had formed the committee under the chairmanship of a retired superior court judge, Justice Khilji Arif Hussain, and assigned it the task of identifying negligence on the part of police and private hospitals in dealing with emergency situations and suggest reforms after it had taken notice of the incident in which Amal died after being hit during an exchange of gunfire between police and robbers in Karachi.

Take a look: A crime unpunished

In its report submitted to the court on Wednesday, the committee pointed out that Karachi had in recent past gone through a law and order crisis, which had resulted in the killing of many innocent citizens and members of law enforcement agencies. Though the situation had now improved considerably on the sectarian and ethnic fronts, the challenge posed by street crimes had grown serious and was resulting in the loss of human lives and valuables almost on a daily basis.

Personnel should be trained to use appropriate force in tricky situations, says its report

It appeared that police had not prepared for the transitory phase and were still in the mode of fighting terrorism, said the report.

The committee recommended that SMGs should be authorised for use only in sensitive areas of Karachi, including some parts of South Zone (Lyari) and West Zone, in proportion to the threats posed.

The squads deputed to protect police officers, judges and ministers should carry only one SMG per vehicle and the remaining policemen should be armed with pistols, said the report. There is a specialised unit, namely the Rapid Response Force, which should be available and duty-bound for dealing with high-risk situations, which involve the use of heavy arms and ammunition.

The committee said that police personnel lacked training, adding that Karachi was highly urbanised and in the event of a police encounter a highly trained force was required. But it has been observed that police officers do not take refresher courses and/or conduct firing practice regularly.

As a result, they end up causing collateral damage, in the shape of loss of lives of innocent citizens. Therefore, there must be a mandatory requirement of refresher courses on a regular basis (at least after every six months). The committee pointed out that training with regard to urban policing was also required. The personnel should be able to assess the appropriate amount of force that should be used in a situation. The culture of carrying out encounters should be discouraged.

The personnel should also be trained to use measures other than using arms and ammunition wherever possible. Training to take calculated and proportionate decisions was pertinent, especially in urban policing, said the committee’s report.

The committee noted that police stations were still maintaining a manual system for recording arms and ammunition, which could be manipulated in case of a serious incident. Therefore, the inventories of arms and ammunition at the headquarters and police stations should be computerised and biometric machines should be installed to make the officials accountable.

The IBS facility should be used to identify the weapons and ammunition that are given to the personnel. In this way the weapon that is issued could be easily traced whenever it is fired or goes missing.

Weapon recognition should be coordinated with the biometrics to keep a complete check on who the weapon was allotted to, how much ammunition was used, etc.

The committee also highlighted the poor management of the operational and investigation branches of police. The additional SHO concerned was involved in misappropriation of recovered amount from the culprits. The official who had prepared the recovery memo was guilty of corruption and should be awarded severe punishment, it said.

The investigation officers failed to arrest the co-accused for a very long time, even though he could have easily been traced out earlier. The investigation branch required refresher courses and better supervision of senior officers in such cases.

A comprehensive strategy was required to implement the Smart City Project in Karachi. Unfortunately for a city of 22 million people, only 2,300 cameras were operational in the city and police had to rely on private CCTV footages, said the committee. The cameras available often produced footage of poor quality.

It was high time the project was implemented in the light of existing Supreme Court orders, said the committee. “It is recommended that the legislature enact (if need be) and/or the Sindh government enforces a mandatory requirement wherein all commercial entities have to install cameras on all outside corners of their shops, establishment, building, etc, at their cost of installation, running and maintenance,” read its report.

Cameras in residential areas should be the responsibility of the Sindh government and lack of this facility should attract penal provisions such as a fine on the owner/owners, the committee added.

",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua has said that the scope of activities for international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) has been defined in accordance with the nation’s requirements.

Speaking to foreign envoys on the issue of INGOs registration, she said “activities that are responsive to Pakistan’s national development priorities” had been identified.

The sectors in which INGOs are being encouraged to work are poverty alleviation, health, vocational education and training, science and technology, environmental protection, disaster management, sports and culture.

The government had started fresh registration of INGOs in 2015 after announcement of the registration policy. A total of 141 INGOs had applied for registration under the new policy, out of which applications of 74 were approved, while those of 41 were rejected.

Since the scope of activities was also restricted, some of the organizations, particularly those working on issues like democracy, governance, rule of law and security opted to close down.

The policy was criticised by donor countries as restrictive and non-transparent.

Defending the policy, Ms Janjua said the decisions on cancellation of registration and closure were in full accord with the standards of due process and that the right of appeal and opportunities to discuss mutual concerns were provided to the INGOs.

She recalled that 74 INGOs were still operational in the country.

The foreign secretary, however, reaffirmed the government’s commitment to a “mutually beneficial framework on INGOs, underpinned by rule of law, transparency and responsive to nationally determined development priorities”.

She further noted that the policy framework was “guided by Pakistan’s national context, circumstances, needs and priorities”.

It was agreed that the envoys of donor countries would remain engaged with the government for exploring options for addressing concerns of the INGO sector.

Donor countries have insisted that the new policy would affect Pakistan’s image as “a partner on human development”. They have, therefore, been demanding a “more cooperative and nuanced arrangement on INGOs”.

",2019-01-17,"KARACHI: In less than six months of its existence, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government seems to be moving towards being mired in numbers game as one of its key supporters in the parliament, the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), has hinted at parting ways with the ruling party while complaining of its “non-seriousness” over the points both sides agreed when their partnership began.

Though BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal assured that no anti-government move would come from his party, he sounded impressed with the fresh political development in the country when the opposition parties agreed on formation of a committee to finalise a joint strategy to give tough time to the government, saying such moves “always bring political stability in Pakistan.”

“Let me make it very clear that we are not part of the government,” he said while responding to questions by reporters outside his DHA residence before a meeting of his party’s central executive committee. “We have provided them support while sitting on independent benches. We support their every positive move and oppose negative ones. But the fact is that we have not witnessed seriousness at the government’s end over our agreed points, which convinces us to review our strategy.”

PTI is non-serious over mutually agreed agenda, says Mengal

Sharing his experiences with the PTI government and Prime Minister Imran Khan, Mr Mengal said that after every meeting between the two sides, a committee was formed “for nothing,” which only suggested another meeting leaving the real issues stagnant at the same level where they were some six months ago.

“We agreed on the six-point agenda at the time of the presidential elections and earlier after the general elections we developed consensus on nine points. But unfortunately, not one of these points has been taken up. I think there is sheer lack of seriousness [on part of the PTI] and unfortunately there’s no change in its attitude despite several reminders,” the BNP-M leader said.

Days after the PTI secured majority in the July 25 elections, it reached an agreement with the BNP-M and the two parties signed a six-point memorandum of understanding (MoU) after a marathon session between Mr Mengal and Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Under the MoU signed by Mr Mengal and Mr Qureshi, the BNP-M — having four seats in the National Assembly — had supported the PTI candidates for the office of prime minister and speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly.

However, cracks started emerging in the parliamentary partnership within a couple of months and Mr Mengal on record warned the PTI leadership that his party could withdraw its support for the federal government if the ruling party continued ignoring it while taking decisions about Balochistan. The warning, it appears, has now turned into action from Mr Mengal who is mulling it over before making a key decision about his party’s future strategy in the parliament while acknowledging the alliance of the opposition parties.

“We are not going to make any move against the government and if they review their strategy we would continue to support it,” he replied to a question about possible role of his party, after withdrawing support for the government, in the opposition alliance that had emerged recently. “The meeting of [Pakistan Peoples’ Party leader] Asif Zardari and [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz chief] Shahbaz Sharif is a good omen. The political forces always move together for strong democracy despite differences. I think it would bring political stability in the country.”

",2019-01-16,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued its detailed judgement regarding the rejection of a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) appeal against the Islamabad High Court decision to suspend the prison sentences awarded to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in the Avenfield corruption reference.

A five-member larger bench of the SC had on Monday thrown out the accountability watchdog's appeal challenging the September 19, 2018, IHC order under which Sharif, his daughter and son-in-law retired captain Mohammad Safdar were granted bail after suspension of their jail terms.

The five-page SC written judgement, penned by Chief Justice-designate Asif Saeed Khosa, while detailing the reasons for dismissal of NAB's appeal has pointed out several flaws in the IHC judgement for suspension of the Sharifs' sentences.

The verdict notes that ""instead of adhering to the guidelines issued and recommendations made"" by the SC in an earlier case regarding shorter formats of orders to be passed in matters of bail, the high court had issued a 41-page judgement while deciding the Sharif's bail petitions.

According to the judgement, it is a settled principle of law that while deciding an application for bail or the suspension of sentence, the merits of the case are not commented upon in detail. However, the IHC in its impugned judgement ""had not only undertaken a detailed assessment of the merits of the case but had also recorded some categorical conclusions regarding the same"".

Besides, the Sharifs' writ petitions for suspension of their sentences were taken up at a time when their main appeals challenging the accountability court's verdict in the Avenfield case had already been fixed for hearing. This is in contrast to judicial norms, the judgement said, because sentences are usually suspended considering that a convict ""may not be kept in custody till his appeal is fixed for hearing"".

Citing previous cases, the written verdict says that the SC has clarified that in cases under the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 a high court may exercise its constitutional jurisdiction to grant bail ""only in extraordinary circumstances and in cases of extreme hardship"". But in the cases concerning the Sharifs, ""no such extraordinary circumstance or hardship had been referred to"" by the IHC in its judgement.

Additionally, the judgement says that by adverting to some deficiencies in the evidence that led to the Sharif's conviction under Section 9(a)(v) of NAO 1999, the high court had failed to consider that conclusions in that regard at the bail stage were ""premature"" as additional evidence could have been adduced or procured during the pendency of their appeals.

""Despite the above-mentioned deficiencies found by us in the impugned judgments,"" the verdict reads, ""we are cognisant of the legal position that considerations for grant of bail and those for its cancellation are entirely different"".

Detailing reasons for the dismissal of NAB's appeal, the SC judgement noted that the bureau had not levelled any allegations of misuse or abuse of the concession of bail by the Sharifs.

In addition, one of the three respondents (Nawaz Sharif) is already in jail after being convicted in another case; a second respondent (Maryam) is a woman and ""the law envisages concession for her in the matter of bail""; and the prison sentenced awarded by the trial court to the third respondent (Safdar) was quite short.

In these ""peculiar circumstances"", the SC bench did not feel persuaded to interfere with the jurisdiction exercised by the IHC in deciding the bail applications. NAB's appeal was thus dismissed.

On July 6, 2018, Judge Mohammad Bashir of the accountability court while deciding the Avenfield apartments reference had awarded 10-year imprisonment to Nawaz Sharif, seven years to his daughter Maryam and one year to his son-in-law Safdar.

Two months later, a division bench of the IHC had accepted their petitions seeking suspension of the sentence and set them free on Sept 19. The judgement was subsequently challenged in the apex court by NAB.",Haseeb Bhatti,Dawn,Judiciary,"Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, NAB, Supreme Court",0

Photos of the approval meeting were tweeted out yesterday by the tourism minister Mohammad Atif Khan who formally approved the budget in the presence of members of the KP Youth Development Commission, which is the think-tank responsible for planning the facility.

A youth centre, even a segregated one, can be a step towards more pronounced participation by women in Peshawar's public life. However, many noticed that women were ostensibly missing from the meeting, calling them to question if any were even consulted during the planning phase?

However, according to Asfandyar Khattak, Director Youth Affairs KP, the planning of the youth centre was undertaken by an all-women committee consisting of five female professionals. He explained that no women are seen in the photo because the female members were on the visit of the place finalised for the centre, and joined the meeting later. He added that the centre will be operational within three months and it remain open from 8am to 10pm.

Mr Khattak's clarification is a relief, for the apparent exclusion of women raises concerns about whether the centre's plans were informed by what men think women need rather than what women are given the space to demand?

What use is this to IK?... We're not sure yet - but he seems extremely happy to be receiving it.

However, we're at odds with this choice of present and feel the PM could've been given a more 'thoughtful' gift, because really, Imran Khan is a man of simple taste.

Here're 5 things we feel would've been best suited for the PM. For starters...

1) A new set of clothes

It's a known fact that Imran Khan refuses to buy new clothes and since all his clothes are worn out, like IK's wife Bushra Maneka says they are, a few shalwar kameez and suits would've been a sweet gift. #NewYearNewMe

2) A gold replica of the '92 World Cup trophy

Let's be real, Imran Khan's 1992 World Cup win is something Insaafiyans cannot stop bragging about - and neither can he. Ask any PTI supporter why IK is best suited for his role as PM and they'll argue that he won us the World Cup... in the early 90s... which really isn't the same as running the country BUT it's still a win and this way at least Imran gets to brag about it while also showing it off in gold!

3) A free lifetime supply of Al Baik chicken

We all have our favourites, Nawaz loves paye, Imran loves chicken, what better way to win the PM's heart than a free lifetime supply of broasted chicken from the one restaurant Saudi Arabia is known for?

4) A set of gold dumbbells

The Prime Minister loves to exercise, we know because he's shown us, over and over and over again. A pair of gold dumbbells would've proved to IK that he's really, truly cared for.

5) More money for the dam fund

Nothing speaks volumes of love (for IK) than donating money towards his dam fund. Although the KSA has already donated Rs62 million towards it, it would've made up for the remaining population of our country that lives below poverty line - also not every expat can afford to donate $1000 or every Pakistani, Rs10.

He pleaded that the right to travel and free movement was guaranteed under the Constitution, however, the impugned memorandum issued by the interior ministry was in utter violation of his fundamental rights.

The MPA contended that a bare perusal of the ministry’s memorandum showed that it had been issued in an unfair exercise of executive powers and failed to give any valid reason. He further pleaded that the act of placing his name on the ECL was in violation of Articles 2-A, 4, 9, 15, and 25 of the Constitution.

The petitioner asked the court to set aside the impugned memorandum for being unlawful and order the ministry to remove his name from the ECL. As an immediate relief, he urged the court to suspend the memorandum and grant him one-time permission to travel abroad till a final decision on the petition.

""I am the representative of the people of the largest province and have been taking regular part in all the NAB inquiries [against myself]. However, pending NAB cases have been made the reason for the inclusion of my name in the ECL,"" the petitioner argued.

Justice Muhammad Farrukh Irfan took up the petition in court today and allowed Hamza to leave the country once for a 10-day span.

""I belong to a political family and my name has been placed ECL dishonestly,"" he claimed.

""Does being a public representative mean that a person enjoys complete freedom?"" retorted Additional Attorney General Ashfaq A Khan, who represented the federal government in court.

""These courts are based on the premise that the law is equal for all citizens,"" Justice Irfan said.

The additional attorney general said that a high court judgement itself had laid down the rules for the restriction of movement for any citizen.

""If someone has caused monetary losses to the national exchequer they can be stopped from leaving the country,"" the advocate general told the court.

""Remember, those who are in the government today may be sitting in the opposition tomorrow,"" the judge said during the hearing, adding that the chief justice and SC judges are unhappy with the way NAB is conducting itself.

""Is the country going to be run by NAB? Should the courts and the parliament stop functioning?"" Justice Irfan wondered.

The interior ministry, passport and immigration personnel, and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) were made respondents in the petition, and the court issued the interior ministry a notice seeking its reply in the matter.

",2019-01-16,"WHAT was the impact of Chief Justice Saqib Nisar’s tenure on the fragility of Pakistan’s democracy? Justice Saqib Nisar challenged one of the foundational principles of democratic constitutional theory, according to which the judiciary’s role in executive and legislative affairs is circumscribed. Under the leadership of a new chief justice, the Supreme Court should decide whether Justice Nisar’s brand of judicial activism should be maintained or abandoned.

The SC’s authority to review legislative and executive action to assess whether it is consistent with the Constitution is well established, but in traditional democratic constitutions, the judiciary restrains itself from playing a prominent role in executive and legislative affairs. Judicial overreach that undercuts the democratic branches is not approved.

Read more: Judicial independence is vital for democracy but judicial activism can be counterproductive

In new and fragile democracies, however, courts tend to exercise more influence over other branches of government, reflecting the recognition that these institutions may not have the capacity or willingness to enforce fundamental human rights and provide public services equitably and transparently. Article 199 and Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan give our superior judiciary the authority to make orders to enforce fundamental rights. Similar provisions exist in India’s constitution.

Judicial intervention in politics should be judged on the basis of whether it promotes democratic governance.

The expanded role of the judiciary in new and fragile democracies of the Global South is visible in India, South Africa, Brazil and Colombia. In these jurisdictions, the role played by courts would, broadly speaking, not be countenanced in more mature Western democracies. In the contexts of newer democracies, the challenge posed by dysfunctional governance is one of the central concerns of the judiciary. This ethos is encapsulated in the words of a former chief justice of the Indian supreme court: “The court has to innovate new methods and devise new strategies for the purpose of providing access to justice to large masses of people who are denied their basic human rights and to whom freedom and liberty have no meaning.”

While new and fragile democracies may present a better case for an expansive judicial role, these same contexts are also most vulnerable to the stifling effects of judicial overreach. Where the judiciary positions itself as a replacement of political branches of government, it runs the risk of stunting the growth of these institutions, and where the judiciary repeatedly shames the executive branch, it threatens to discredit democratic institutions.

Read more: CJP says his every step was in constitutional limit

In such circumstances, judicial activism may actually serve to promote the backsliding of fragile democracies towards authoritarianism, which is arguably what we have witnessed in Pakistan since the lead-up to the 2018 national elections.

How then should the court’s role be defined in fragile democracies? Judicial intervention in political affairs should be judged on the basis of whether it promotes democratic governance. Judicial activism is justified if it strengthens civil society and promotes constitutional culture among the public at large. Conversely, judicial activism that has the effect of stunting democratic institutions must be rejected.

How does Justice Nisar’s brand of judicial activism fare against this standard? Justice Nisar took on significant public programme and policy initiatives that typically fall within the powers of the executive and legislature, most notably the Diamer Basha and Mohmand dam fund-raising campaign. Justice Nisar also displayed little faith in the ability of civilian bureaucracies to carry out their duties.

Read more: Pakistan hasn’t succeeded in reforming its bureaucracy in the past. Can the PTI deliver?

Instead of leaving the investigation of certain high-profile cases to law-enforcement authorities, such as the police and the FIA, in their normal course of duty, Justice Nisar ordered the constitution of Joint Investigation Teams.

At the same time, his highly publicised visits to government hospitals where he berated officials for their incompetence reflected an impatience with civil bureaucracies. By taking notice of the quality of bottled water and exorbitant private school fees, the chief justice authoritatively stepped in to fill what he perceived to be gaps in private-sector regulation by the government.

Justice Nisar used his suo motu powers expansively and initiated cases on issues that he considered to be the pressing concerns of our time, such as water scarcity and high rates of population growth. In devising remedies, the voice of Justice Saqib Nisar was pre-eminent. Any role played by human rights activists, civil society groups or the affected public was largely muted.

The effect of Justice Nisar’s court has been perceived as undermining political institutions either by assuming the role and responsibility of political branches or by openly displaying contempt towards elected officials and civil bureaucrats. Justice Nisar’s interference with executive and legislative affairs exposed what many would consider the questionable side of judicial activism and its threat to the evolution of democracy.

How is the SC to avoid this effect while at the same time play its role in enforcing fundamental rights in matters of public importance, as envisaged in Article 184(3) of the Constitution? Public-interest litigation should be used as a means to expand democratic spaces rather than judicial promotion. Instead of aggressively using its suo motu powers, the superior judiciary should encourage cases initiated by affected citizens and civil society groups. Since new and fragile democracies such as Pakistan are plagued with non-transparency, the SC should use its constitutional mandate to fill this gap by devising remedies that create space for civil society to monitor government performance. The main goal of the SC’s exercise of judicial power should be to enhance citizen engagement and accountability.

After Justice Nisar’s retirement, the SC has the opportunity to reassess its constitutional role based on the principle that a more ­modest exercise of power is conducive to ­democratic growth. The SC can remedy government dysfunction by creating spaces for civil ­society rather than using its judicial power to ­overshadow political discourse.

",2019-01-16,"WITH Pakistan-India ties seemingly in a deep freeze, diplomats and consular staff of the two countries once again appear to have become victims of harassment and intimidation.

A 1992 agreement, a code of conduct that both countries agreed to for the treatment of diplomatic and consular personnel in India and Pakistan, is being tested after Pakistan protested the police detention of a Pakistani High Commission official in New Delhi, and India has countered with allegations of rough behaviour by Pakistani security personnel against senior Indian diplomats in Islamabad.

The latest accusations come less than a year since India and Pakistan once again decided to abide by the 1992 code of conduct, a re-commitment that became necessary after a spate of unsavoury incidents in New Delhi and Islamabad.

The fresh incidents should be dealt with quickly and appropriately in both New Delhi and Islamabad — whatever the difficulties in ties between the two states, diplomats must be allowed to continue with their work of representing their country and should not face intimidation and harassment.

Unhappily, some elements in both countries view normal diplomatic work with a great deal of suspicion and perhaps do not comprehend the risks of a diplomatic rupture between the two states.

The disruption to the lives of diplomats is just the latest indicator that a serious rethink of the state of Pakistan-India ties is needed in both countries.

The Pakistani leadership — both the civilian and military — has repeatedly stated its interest in dialogue on all issues with India, including terrorism, but the stubbornness of the Indian leadership has not made possible even preliminary talks about eventual dialogue.

Perhaps the Pakistani leadership can look towards specific offers and innovative ideas to draw the Indian leadership into a dialogue process.

Of course, if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government only see Pakistan as a useful rhetorical and political foil in the upcoming Indian general election, there may be nothing that the Pakistanis can do to try and break the impasse in bilateral relations.

Whatever the case, the tendency to target diplomats in India and Pakistan is an unwelcome practice that must immediately cease. The 1992 bilateral code of conduct has survived many ups and downs and acute tensions. It is a sensible agreement that ought to be upheld by India and Pakistan both in letter and spirit.

",2019-01-16,"ISLAMABAD: A high alert has been declared at Pims to deal with any untoward situation.

The hospital spokesman, Dr Wasim Khawaja, told Dawn: “The step was taken in view of an alert issued for Punjab by the inspector general of the provincial police.”

All necessary measures mentioned in the standard operating procedure (SOP) have been adopted, Dr Khawaja said.

Under a high alert, duties of doctors and paramedical staff are assigned and their leaves are cancelled.

Besides, the availability of all necessary medicines as well as stock of blood are ensured and ambulances are put on a standby.

A senior police officer said high alert or red alert was declared on a threat alert issued either by the capital administration or the interior ministry. So far no such alert has been issued for the capital, he added.

“Security measures in the capital are already on a state of high alert since long,” said the officer.

But senior police officers have been asked to review the security measures for important public places.

Police pickets at the entrance of the capital were strengthened and personnel asked to keep an eye on suspects and suspicious vehicles.

The alert issued by the IGP stated that according to intelligence, four TTP militants were planning to conduct an attack on an intelligence setup in Lahore and anywhere in Punjab, said the police officer.

",2019-01-16,"A YEAR ago, the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud in Karachi sparked public outrage of an intensity that seemed impossible for the state to ignore.

Staged police encounters both in Sindh and elsewhere, especially Punjab, have gone virtually unchallenged over decades, claiming the lives of untold numbers of innocents, or at least of those not yet proven guilty. But this one caught the imagination of civil society. Perhaps it was because the story of the young man — no terrorist as alleged by the cops but an aspiring model — found its way on to social media where it echoed for weeks. Or maybe it was simply the straw that broke the camel’s back — one murder too many even in a country inured to state brutality, that too allegedly at the hands of ‘encounter specialist’ SSP Rao Anwar.

Dawn Investigation: Rao Anwar and the killing fields of Karachi

The event also proved a catalyst for festering resentments among a large segment of the population to coalesce into a movement for human rights. Nevertheless, one year on, the trial court has yet to indict the senior police official, who has since retired, or the other 25 suspects.

The facts of the case were, sadly, unexceptional. Four men, Naqeebullah among them, were abducted by cops in Karachi’s Malir district, taken to an abandoned farmhouse in the area and shot dead on Jan 13, 2018.

Take a look: Waiting for the next Naqeebullah

None of the victims, it subsequently emerged, even had a criminal record. A police inquiry committee found circumstantial evidence of Rao Anwar’s presence at the scene of the killings; a supplementary charge-sheet accused him and his subordinate cops of registering fake criminal cases, kidnapping, murder, and destroying evidence.

Also read: 'Naqeebullah Mehsud was innocent, was killed in a fake encounter,' says inquiry team

The case against the top police official could have been a turning point in the bloody saga of police brutality and extra-judicial killings that has long afflicted this country. However, what has transpired since makes a mockery of the criminal justice system; indeed, it displays a wicked disregard for the possibility of transitioning into a well-ordered society.

Rao Anwar’s demeanour in court, where he would arrive with full protocol and without handcuffs, was unmistakably that of a man secure in the knowledge that he was above the law — indeed, as unaccountable as those whose backing he allegedly enjoys.

The former SSP was confined for a few months to the comfort of his own home, conveniently declared a sub-jail on flimsy pretexts. Even that restriction was lifted last July when he was granted bail by an anti-terrorism court.

Selective application of ‘justice’, an absence of due process, and the perversion of law enforcement into a vehicle of terror corrodes the very foundations of society, ensuring an unending cycle of violence.

The message that the lack of a trial thus far in the Naqeebullah case and the shocking indulgence shown to the prime suspect is that the police need fear no consequences for their actions against a hostage citizenry.

",2019-01-16,"IT has all the appearance of a well-intentioned attempt to square the circle between the youth’s need to find an occasion to express affection and joy (hardly an unseemly impulse) and the religious right’s calls to ban anything it deems in opposition to our culture and values (an ever-widening basket of ‘offences’).

And it may well be were it not for the fact that, beneath its benign surface, the alternative it offers betrays the selfsame posture of moral policing as its more strident diktats.

The announcement by a varsity in Faisalabad that it would observe Feb 14 as ‘Sisters’ Day’ might seem like a frivolous attempt at rebranding Valentine’s Day to give it a patina of ‘respectability’ (the vice chancellor’s stated rationale was to turn a ‘threat’ into an opportunity).

Yet the VC also said that the university was mulling plans to distribute scarves, shawls and gowns to its female students. Implicit in this is the suggestion that what Pakistan’s sisters truly need is not gender parity (or even so much as a token gesture of genuine esteem) — but to cover themselves up.

The Pakistani sisterhood might look at such a backhanded proposal with bemusement, and wonder at the neglect of the nation’s brothers for the lack of public interest in their behaviour and attire.

But it also speaks to a broader phenomenon in which, every year, state and private institutions alike descend into paroxysms of panic at the advent of Valentine’s Day. Legal, official or societal interventions to browbeat the public into abstaining from cheer demonstrate lack of restraint and respect for people’s right to choose.

And it is particularly sanctimonious juxtaposed with genuine, year-round social ills such as misogyny and gender-based violence (the antidote to which is not further maladjustment) conveniently ignored by those who would seek to proscribe all inter-gender interactions. Hopefully, this February, better sense will prevail.

Both countries have yet to sign extradition or prisoner exchange treaties.

Earlier, during a brief chat with media, the Afghan ambassador failed to come up with a reply when asked about media reports that Afghan Taliban leader Hafez Mohibullah has been detained in Peshawar.

He said efforts were under way for peace in Afghanistan.

“We are here to work for peace in Afghanistan,” he said declining to comment on the detention of the Taliban leader.

The ambassador was very apprehensive about ill-treatment of Afghan nationals at the hands of Pakistani security personnel at Torkham border-crossing point and said the issue had been discussed with Pakistani Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

He said he would visit Torkham to review situation and would discuss the matter with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shah Farman and Corps Commander Shaheen Mazhar Mahmood today (Wednesday).

Mr Mashal said Afghan citizens coming to Pakistan were lined up at the entry gate for hours.

“We don’t need verbal promises. They (Pakistanis) should fulfil the promise of friendship, which they have been making,” he insisted.

The envoy said Pakistani authorities had promised to facilitate the entry of Afghan travelers at Torkham. He said he had proposed to make separate arrangements for women, elders and ambulance service at Torkham border to prevent mess and keep them from long wait.

Mr Mashal complained that every Afghan visa applicant was paying $200 outside Pakistani diplomatic mission in Kabul. He said the issue needed to be resolved.

The ambassador said officials of Pakistani missions in Kabul and Jalalabad were not involved in the illegal practice.

He said he had asked General Bajwa to increase the number of visas for Afghans and allow other consulates in Afghanistan to facilitate visa seekers.

Pakistani mission in Kabul issues 300 to 350 visas to Afghan nationals on a daily basis.

Mr Mashal expressed concern about the reports of the officials receiving bribes from Afghan truckers transporting goods under the Afghan Transit Trade.

He said ‘malpractices’ of the police and personnel of other law-enforcement agencies had a negative impact on the bilateral trade and therefore, Pakistani government should take measures for stopping illegal practices at checkposts.

",2019-01-16,"ISLAMABAD: Early marriages and the practice of feeding girls less than boys are key reasons for stunting in children, the country director of the Global Aliiance for Improved Nutrition said on Tuesday.

Dr Qaiser Munir Pasha was speaking at a seminar on Adolescent Nutrition in Pakistan: Identifying Opportunities and Setting Priorities, which was organised by the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS).

Take a look: Why do child stunting and maternal health feature so high on Prime Minister Imran Khan's priorities?

Boys are generally given more food than girls, he said, because of which girls are unable to compete with boys in many fields, and malnourished mothers cannot give birth to health babies.

“Currently, 41pc of children do not go to school in Pakistan. The worst situation is in Balochistan, where only 20pc children go to school. There is need to ensure women and children are properly nourished because only that is how the mother and child mortality rate can be reduced,” he said.

Seminar on adolescent nutrition in Pakistan held

Dr Baseer Khan Achakzai, a health expert, said the first 1,000 days remain a critical period of nutritional need. Adolescence, the period between 10 and 19 years of age, is characterised by rapid biological and psychosocial growth and development. Up to 45pc of skeletal growth takes place and 15 to 25pc of adult height is achieved during adolescence.

“It is a vulnerable time with increased nutritional requirements, particularly for girls who are biologically vulnerable, while often lacking access to nutritious food, education, and other opportunities owing to gendered cultural norms,” he said.

NHS ministry representative Dr Khawaja Masood said the establishment of a platform dedicated to adolescent nutrition, the National Technical Advisory and Advocacy Platform for Improved Adolescent Nutrition, was a landmark achievement.

“This has not only served to bring together key partners in the adolescent nutrition space but will also anchor and drive further actions for adolescent nutrition in the country,” he said.

During the technical session, speakers explained that Pakistan has a high burden of malnutrition, costing $7.6 billion, or 3pc of the GDP, every year.

The evidence review suggested that adolescents experience a high burden of stunting, thinness, and being overweight. Girls appear to experience a higher burden of stunting (11-23pc) and being overweight/obesity (8pc) than boys (5pc for both).

Boys have a slightly higher prevalence of thinness (12pc) than girls (10pc).

Thinness is more common in rural areas and being overweight/obesity in urban areas. Anaemia is prevalent among adolescent girls (54pc) as well as deficiencies in folic acid (49pc), zinc (42pc) and vitamin A (40pc).

It was informed that household food insecurity is a major barrier to obtaining an adequate diet, especially in rural areas where more than half of households are food insecure.

The review further suggested that adolescent diets are generally poor, not sufficiently diverse, and are overwhelmingly of wheat and low in fruits, vegetables, pulses, potatoes, meat and eggs.

Adolescent girls rarely have control of food expenditure or distribution within the household; the primary decision makers for the purchase of packaged foods are their mothers, who have limited nutritional knowledge.

Although the age at first marriage is rising, one-third of women between 25 and 49 were married by 18, and 8pc of women between 20 and 24 gave birth by 18, increasing their risk of poor birth outcomes. Adolescents also have poor access to sexual and reproductive health care: only 13pc of adolescents between 15 and 19 use family planning services and 37pc of women between 15 and 49 receive at least four antenatal visits.

",2019-01-16,"ISLAMABAD: The accountability court of Islamabad on Tuesday rejected the application of former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani seeking exemption from personal appearance in case of award of alleged illegal advertising contract to a private ad agency.

The court said such application could only be entertained after framing of charges.

The ex-PM was seeking exemption from personal appearance on account of visiting abroad. The prosecutor of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on the other hand argued that under the law an accused could not file exemption plea before indictment.

Former prime minister Gilani, former secretary of Information Technology Farooq Awan, former press information officer (PIO) Mohammad Saleem, former company secretary Universal Service Fund Syed Hasan Sheikh, the CEO of Messrs Midas (Pvt) Ltd Inam Akbar and several other individuals from the Ministry of Information Technology were named in the corruption reference.

They are accused of misusing their authority to illegally grant Messrs Midas an advertising contract in contravention of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules.

The act is reported to have cost the national treasury Rs129.07 million.

",2019-01-16,"LAHORE: A special committee of experts constituted by the Supreme Court has expressed concern over the improper repair, maintenance and conservation of various heritage sites along the route of Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project.

The [committee] members, who visited 11 heritage sites along the route from Jan 14 to 15, have also sought immediate repair and maintenance of the sites in a professional manner.

According to a report, the committee headed by Sayed Zahid Hussain (former SC judge) and consisted of members including Zahid Saleem Gondal (director general, archaeology) Hammadul Hasssan (project director), Furqan Ali Malik (Nespak chief engineer), retired Prof Khurshid Ahmed, Dr Rizwan Riaz, Muhammad Afzal Khan, Maqsood Ahmed Malik, Raja Tariq Nazir and Muhammad Naeem Iqbal visited buildings of GPO, Shah Chiragh mazar and mosque, Supreme Court registry, Saint Andrew Church, Mauj Darya shrine and mosque, Chauburji Gateway and Zaibun Nisa Tomb on Tuesday. Similarly it visited Shalamar Garden, Buddu Ka Awa, Ghulabi Bagh and Lakshmi on Monday.

The committee observed that plaster inside the shrine of Shah Chiragh Tomb has decayed and there were also signs of dampness. Rafique Noor (EXEN, Auqaf department) on the occasion briefed the committee members that work on the renovation and conservation of the shrine and the mosque, which was constructed during the era of Shah Jahan, has commenced.

Similarly the paint, marble flooring, fresco paint, roof treatment and conservation work will also be carried out and visible changes will be made by the end of February 2019. The team noted that though major work on Saint Andrew Church was completed, a storm drain and ramp outside the church is yet to be constructed.

The committee witnessed removal of debris from the Mauj Darya shrine and completion of three temporary stairs at the shrine. However, it observed that construction of the retaining wall was yet to be launched due to paucity of funds. The team found tiles on the entrance to the shrine broken and the platform outside it required finishing. The team, however, appreciated the mosaic tile work at outer lawn of the Chauburji. The team observed that the gateway was yet to be converted into green belt despite availability of funds with the executing agencies.

On the occasion, the LDA officials told the committee that boundary wall, footpath and drain of both GPO and Supreme Court registry have been completed. However, the committee noticed that exhaust ducks boundary wall is yet to be completed.

The members found heaps in the Zaibun Nisa shrine. Similarly, according to them, red stone and fresco work of the tomb required finishing. Back side of the tomb needed some repair as there were some cracks in the tomb.

Earlier while visiting other sites, the committee members were told by the officials that the hydraulic tank of the Shalamar Gardens has been restored to its original position and the surrounding portion converted into green area. They also claimed that decorative motifs of Shalamar Gardens have been replicated on the train station of Shalamar Garden to create harmony.

However, the committee emphasised the need to conserve and protect the monuments like Shalamar Gardens strictly in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court. The committee also found maintenance of Buddu Ka Awa not up to the mark. However, it commended the efforts of conserving Gulabi Bagh Gateway.

The committee noticed appearance of cracks in Lakshmi building and directed the officials for strengthening the columns and filling of the cracks within the shortest possible time.

",2019-01-16,"LAHORE: Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz has approached the Lahore High Court for removal of his name from the Exit Control List (ECL).

Filed through Advocate Azam Nazir Tarar, Hamza stated in a writ petition that the interior ministry placed his name on the exit control list (ECL) in an arbitrary manner as no opportunity of hearing had been afforded to him before the impugned action.

The opposition leader stated that he on Nov 27, 2018, intended to travel abroad to see his ailing wife, undergoing medical treatment in the United Kingdom. However, he said, he was informed by the authorities that his name had been included in the list on the advice of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

Mr Hamza pleaded that the right to travel and free movement was guaranteed under the Constitution, however, the impugned memorandum issued by the interior ministry was in utter violation of his fundamental rights.

He contended that a bare perusal of the ministry’s memorandum showed that it had been issued in an unfair exercise of executive powers and failed to give any valid reason.

He further pleaded that the act of placing his name on the ECL was in violation of Articles 2-A, 4, 9, 15, and 25 of the Constitution.

The petitioner asked the court to set aside the impugned memorandum for being unlawful and order the ministry to remove his name from the ECL.

As an immediate relief, he urged the court to suspend the memorandum and grant him a one-time permission to travel abroad till the final decision of the petition.

Justice Farrukh Irfan Khan will take up the petition on Wednesday (today).

Hamza along with his father Shahbaz Sharif and brother Salman Shahbaz is facing multiple NAB inquiries, including those into Ramzan Sugar Mills road construction and assets beyond means.

During the hearing of multiple petitions against the government’s plan to allow the kite flying, a law officer also told the court that no decision had been taken so far with respect to celebration of the Basant festival.

He said the committee formed by the government on the matter would submit its recommendation within two weeks.

Advocates Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, Sheraz Zaka and others had filed the petitions in public interest, pleading that the kite flying was a deadly sport and could not be allowed at the cost of citizens’ fundamental rights.

The petitioners also challenged the Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying Ordinance 2001 under which the government enjoyed discretionary powers to permit kite-flying activities.

They said the Supreme Court in its 2006 judgment had declared the kite-flying and celebration of basant festival a violation of the fundamental rights.

However, they said, the government introduced an amendment to the law, acquiring the power to allow kite-flying without defining any criteria.

The petitioners asked the court to restrain the government from allowing kite-flying or celebration of basant festival.

They further asked the court to declare null and void the section 4(1) and 4-B of the ordinance, which empowered the government to permit the kite-flying.

Justice Aminuddin Khan adjourned the hearing till Jan 24 for further arguments and also allowed the petitioners to implead the Kite Flying Association in the case.

",2019-01-16,"LAHORE: Former health minister Khwaja Salman Rafiq, who is under NAB custody, attended the Punjab Assembly session on Tuesday after Speaker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi issued his production orders, urging the National Assembly to amend NAB laws to protect basic human rights of all those arrested by it.

The treasury and opposition benches welcomed the [under-arrest] MPA and resolved to concertedly protect democracy in the country.

The speaker had issued the production orders before the start of the session under the assembly rules which were jointly amended for the purpose by a committee comprising members from both the treasury and opposition benches on Monday.

Kh Salman attends session after production order

Khwaja Salman was led to the house by his colleagues amidst slogans. He and former speaker Rana Iqbal thanked the speaker, deputy speaker and the law minister for allowing the facility which earlier missed in the rules.

Rules of the National Assembly and the assemblies of the other three provinces already allow speakers to issue production orders of members who are under arrest.

Mr Salman is in NAB custody along with his brother Khwaja Saad Rafique in connection with the Paragon City scam. He did not complain of any maltreatment by NAB during his captivity, and avoided to discuss the case against him saying it was sub judice and he believed courts would dispense justice.

He conceded that the NAB laws should have been changed in the past, and said the current National Assembly had already worked on the laws a great deal, and should now amend them. The PTI chairman (Imran Khan) should also be approached for the purpose, he said.

Salman said the parliament should revisit the NAB powers to obtain 90-day remand of the accused in any case. It should also check whether a poor government official could afford to pay high fees of lawyers to defend against [NAB] allegations.

Mentioning Nawaz Sharif, Shahbaz Sharif, Saad Rafique and others, he said the PML-N leadership was in jail. (Outside the assembly he said the PML-N was facing targeted accountability).

Salman said the PPP and the PML-N had undergone several tests (of hardship), and did not wish the same for the PTI. “We should stop watching self-interest and start thinking of collectively,” he said. The parliamentarians should make a national road map and serve the nation.

The former minister said all political parties had sacrificed lives, mentioning his father, Saad Rafiq, Dr Nazir and Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi and others who were murdered. At this point Deputy Speaker Dost Mazari added the name of Nawab Akbar Bugti in the list of martyres, and welcomed Khwaja Salman in the house.

Rana Iqbal thanked the speaker, law minister and the treasury benches for amending the rules that allowed Salman’s production. The deputy speaker termed the move a victory of the house.

Law Minister Raja Basharat said by amending the rules, the assembly acted independently. “Let us resolve to concertedly protect democracy and its institutions for all times to come,” he said.

PPP’s Parliamentary Leader Hasan Murtaza thanked the assembly and the government for taking a positive step. “Some people think that the unity of politicians would squeeze their space,” he said.

After the house was adjourned till Wednesday morning, Khwaja Salman called on the speaker in his chambers to pay his regards [for issuing the production orders]. The speaker had earlier told the media that he had issued the orders after consulting the prime minister the CM, the law minister and the entire house.

WHEAT STOCKS: Earlier, the speaker took exception to Food Minister Samiullah’s lack of knowledge about the rotting huge wheat stocks, fixing time for debate on the issue on Wednesday (today). “Check the wheat policy and present it in the house at 2pm tomorrow (Jan 16),” he said after the law minister agreed on the debate.

The issue was agitated by PML-N’s Malik Arshad who asked the government to clear its 2.2 million ton wheat stocks by selling it to people at subsidised rates or exporting it to get rid of the burden and create room for further procurements after two months.

Malik Kamran said the clearance of the stocks was necessary to protect the economic rights of wheat growers. “The government is paying daily Rs 40 to 50 million to banks as interest for huge loans it had obtained for procuring wheat. It is better to sell the stocks to people at subsidized rates,” he said.

The minister said the government would not give any subsidy, and it would be able to clear the stocks anyways.

The deputy speaker, who soon replaced the speaker, referred an adjournment motion to the special committee for report in two months. The motion highlighted the attitude of the Benazir Bhutto Hospital’s [Rawalpindi] medical superintendent with regard to Dr Areeba Abbasi, daughter of the jailed PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi.

The motion was moved by PML-N’s Naseer Ahmad mentioning the victimisation of Dr Abbasi and putting on social media the telephone call of the law minister seeking some relief for the lady doctor after recording it.

The deputy speaker said the MS should have been suspended in the first place as “this may happen to me, you or anyone else.” He ignored the pleas by Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid that there was no victimisation and action against the medical superintendent would be taken within a week.

RESOLUTIONS: The house adopted a resolution moved by PTI’s Momina Waheed asking the federal government to have the Constitution and the elections law amended to allow for the cancellation of the assembly membership of those who fail to take oath of their office three months after their election.

Adopting another resolution moved by PTI’s Seemabia Tahir, the house paid tributes to the army for destroying an Indian spy drone in the Bagh Sector after it crossed over the Line of Control. The action proved that the army was ready to counter any aggression by India and would use all its capabilities to protect every inch of Pakistan, the resolution said, praying for further successes of the army.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was on Tuesday informed that the livestock and fisheries department had not been completely devolved to the province under the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.

Furnishing a statement during Question Hour in the assembly, Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Abdul Bari Pitafi said that the federal government had not fully devolved all functions and assets of the department to the province.

He said that these assets included the Korangi Fish Harbour, shrimp hatchery at Hawkesbay, livestock labs and other infrastructure.

Sindh has not been given control of Korangi Fish Harbour and shrimp hatchery at Hawkesbay

The minister further said that the provincial government had taken up the matter with the inter-provincial coordination ministry for devolving the assets to the province.

“A meeting was held on December 27, 2018 in which we sought sufficient funds from the federal pool for the provincial sector,” he added.

In reply to a question, asked by Khurram Sher Zaman of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, the minister said that the provincial livestock department was engaged with the federal government for the funds to be spent on development of fisheries.

Illegal nets

In reply to another question by Mr Zaman regarding unlawful fishing, Mr Pitafi said that the department was continuously combating against influential mafia in coastal brackish water area.

He said that more than 350 illegal nets were confiscated and cases were referred to the courts of law concerned. “About 120 illegal nets have been burnt after seeking the order from the honourable court”, he added.

The minister said that as far as the inland water was concerned regarding the illegal possession of influential people on any public water bodies, no written complaint was lodged by the bona fide fishermen in the fisheries department.

First biosafety level lab

Replying to other questions, he said that the country’s first “Bio-safety Level Laboratory and Quality Enhancement Cell for Highly Virus Vaccine Development” was also being established in Karachi.

The livestock minister said that vaccines of bird flu and foot-and-mouth diseases (FMDs) of livestock would be produced in this laboratory.

He said that the scheme was initiated in 2013 with a cost of Rs 160.639 million and had to be completed by 2018. However, it suffered delays owing to “typical” way of construction of such laboratories.

“The civil work is 95 per cent completed and now just the equipment has to be installed. The laboratory would be functioning by this year,” the minister assured.

To another question asked by opposition member Nusrat Sehar Abbasi, he said that a project to control “Surra”, an infectious disease among livestock, was initiated with the cost of Rs59.883m in arid and coastal zones at Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Sanghar, Khairpur and Jamshoro.

He said that the scheme was completed in June 2018.

To a supplementary question, he said medicine sufficient for 147,000 animals was imported and as many as 25,338 camels and horses were treated.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday directed its monitoring wing, comprising teams identified as “members of inspection team” (MIT), to file a consolidated statement of rape cases pending in courts across the province till Jan 31.

A two-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar issued the directive during hearing of a petition filed by Kainat Soomro and two other rape victims seeking implementation of the Supreme Court’s guidelines in rape cases and establishment of rape crisis cells at the district level.

At the outset of the hearing, the prosecutor general of Sindh contended that the police stations had already contacted the civil society organisations mentioned in the court order, adding that arrangements for DNA test was available at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) in Jamshoro and they had also inked a memorandum of understanding with the Karachi University for setting up a laboratory on the campus.

Order issued on plea to make rape cases’ investigation effective and DNA tests and preservation of DNA evidence mandatory

While putting off the matter till Jan 31, the bench directed the MIT-II to file a consolidated statement of pending rape cases in the province for further directions at the next hearing.

The petitioners were seeking implementation of a Supreme Court judgment (PLD 2013/107) about making investigation process of rape and assault cases effective and also sought directives for provincial government to make DNA tests and preservation of DNA evidence mandatory in rape cases.

They maintained that the SC had directed the provincial government and other authorities to reform the investigation process of rape cases, but the directions of the apex court were not being complied with, adding that rape victims were unable to get justice due to faulty process of investigation.

While impleading the Sindh health secretary, provincial police chief and others as respondents, the petitioners pleaded to direct them to take immediate steps to improve the investigation system and establish rape crisis cell in each district of the province to help victims in acquiring immediate medical, financial and legal assistance.

They also asserted that the Supreme Court’s guidelines for police investigation officers, medico-legal officers, trial courts should be implemented in letter and spirit.

Treatment of fistula patients

The same bench on Tuesday directed the health secretary to file a compliance report about arrangements made at government hospitals to treat fistula patients.

In compliance with an earlier order of the bench on a petition about fistula repair, health secretary Usman Chachar submitted that a requisition of appointment of nine gynaecologists especially dedicated to Tharparkar was sent to the Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) and it recommended only one candidate. The recommendations of SPSC on remaining posts were still awaited.

He further said that another requisition for appointment of 62 gynaecologists as well as to appoint 429 doctors had also been sent to SPSC, adding that he personally contacted the chairman of the SPSC to expedite the process.

The heath secretary submitted that a request had been made to the finance secretary for an amount of Rs5.880 million for maternal, neonatal and child health.

He contended that the facility to treat fistula patients was available at Chandka Medical College Hospital in Larkana, Peoples Medical College Hospital in Shaheed Benazirabad and the Liaquat University of Medical Sciences Hospital in Jamshoro and sought one month’s time to make the facility available at Ghulam Mohammad Mahar Medical College Sukkur.

In Karachi, the facility is available at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and the Koohi Goth Medical Hospital, a charitable hospital being operated by the main petitioner, he added.

The secretary said that his technical team would examine the reported cases of fistula repair in Karachi in consultation with the petitioners and after a proper evaluation further arrangements in different government hospitals at Karachi would be made.

The petitioners, including gynaecologist Dr Shershah Syed, contended that around 5,000 women died during pregnancy every year in the province due to lack of healthcare facilities in the rural areas.

They further submitted that there was a shortage of medical facilities as well as trained staff to attend to the patients, adding that the government had launched the maternal and newborn child health programme many years ago, but the funds allocated for the programme were never utilised.

The petitioners contended that there were over 1,500 fistula patients in the province, whereas a majority of government hospitals do not provide fistula repair surgeries.

They pleaded that the authorities concerned were directed to ensure access to affordable treatment of obstetric fistula to all women in the province and said that the provincial government should ensure that at least one qualified gynaecologist in every district was trained and equipped to provide fistula repair surgery.

Grant approved for treatment of girl

The bench was informed on Tuesday that the provincial government had approved an amount of Rs2,900,000 for a bone marrow transplant of an eight-year-old girl of Dadu.

The chief justice of SHC had taken notice about the illness of Rahat Batool since her parents could not afford her treatment.

In a previous hearing, the division bench headed by Justice Mazhar had directed the provincial government to provide funds for the treatment of the girl.

On Monday an official said that a summary was approved and the cheque would be handed over to the National Institute of Blood Diseases (NIBD) in three weeks.

He also said that the girl was admitted to the NIBD and the treatment had been started. The bench directed to hand over the cheque to the NIBD within a week.

Thalassaemia centres

An official of the health department on Tuesday sought time from the two-judge SHC bench to file a progress report about thalassaemia centres.

Mohammad Muzaffar and others moved the SHC seeking establishment of thalassaemia centres in Thatta and Sujawal districts.

The health official contended that they had already been making efforts to set up such centres and added that he would file a progress report at the next hearing as to how many thalassaemia centres were under operation with the cooperation of the Sindh government. The matter was adjourned till Feb 19.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) will ask the DHA City managers to provide complete details of its ongoing and future projects and carry out a cumulative impact assessment study.

This assurance came from Sepa during a public hearing held on Tuesday where they were quizzed over a lack of information about the DHA City projects.

The public hearing pertained to the environmental impact study of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCHRC) to be built at the Healthcare City, part of DHA City, in Gadap Town.

Public hearing about environmental impact study of Rs4.5bn Shaukat Khanum cancer hospital project held

Located near M-9, the project is estimated to cost Rs4.5 billion. It’s planned to get operational by 2021 as a 50-bedded facility and gradually have 400 beds for in-house patients.

The programme started off with a briefing on the hospital project. Zahid Hashmi, representing the hospital, said that it would be a third such facility by the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust in the country, which would act as a model institution for treatment of cancer patients in the country’s southern region.

“The project would be a state-of-the-art facility and would get accreditation by the Joint Commission International, one of the world’s leading patient safety organisations,” he said.

At present, there were only three hospitals in the country with JCI accreditation and SKMCHRC Lahore was one of them, he added.

Sharing project details, he said the hospital consisting of a basement and ground-plus-six floors would be spread over 20 acres and developed in three stages.

“The hospital will be equipped with the latest cancer care technology, including radiation bunkers fitted with linear accelerators for radiotherapy and nuclear medicine,” he said.

Giving a presentation on the project’s EIA study conducted by Global Environmental Management Services Pvt Ltd, Syeda Ibtasama Khatoon, representing the consultant, informed the audience that internationally reputed firms were being involved in its building and engineering design and its construction would also be supervised by experts.

“The hospital would have its own underground septic tank from where waste would be discharged into the DHA City sewage channels. Water requirement is estimated to be 12,000 gallons daily which would be met through supplies from the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board, DHA City as well as groundwater,” she said.

On the project’s environmental impact, it was pointed out that the proposed project site had “low abundance of flora and fauna, so its ecological impact is also low, which made the site ideal for constructing the facility.

“The proposed project won’t have any long-term impacts if activities are undertaken as suggested in this EIA report,” said Ms Khatoon.

Her presentation was followed by a question-answer session, which began with a Sepa official raising concerns over patient access to the hospital and disposal of refuse, including nuclear waste.

Responding to the concerns, Naved Zaheer, director of the Engineering Consultants International Ltd (ECIL), responsible for the project’s detailed engineering design and construction supervision, said that there would be a separate access for patients.

“There would be on-site incinerators and a waste treatment plant, separate from the one to be built by DHA City, whereas nuclear waste would be handled as per the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority guidelines,” he said.

The ECIL also specialised in healthcare design and the company had to its credit several hospitals in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Yemen and Pakistan, he added.

He rejected the possibility of any emergency involving nuclear waste leakage and said that radiation activity undertaken at such health facilities were of very low intensity and waste was handled as per the guidelines.

During the session, Sepa officials admitted that they didn’t have knowledge of that particular project when they approved the EIA study of DHA City in 2011.

“At that time, plots for residential, commercial and amenity purposes were only earmarked and investors came later in the picture,” said Imran Sabir, representing Sepa.

Replying to concerns about the fast-paced infrastructural developments in DHA City and how they would impact the environment, the communities living in surrounding areas and affect Karachi’ water resources in coming years, Naeem Mughal, additional director general of Sepa, assured the audience that the agency would ensure compliance with environmental and hospital management rules and regulations in the project/s.

“We will have a meeting with DHA City managers and seek complete details of their ongoing and future projects. We will ask them to submit their updated master plan as well as carry out a cumulative impact assessment of the whole project,” he said.

Dr Viqar Hussain, a senior geologist and consultant, urged Sepa to ensure that DHA City must evolve a plan for waste-water treatment and recycling.

Concern over the absence of DHA City’s representation was also raised.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution unanimously calling upon the provincial government to take measures to rein in population growth in Sindh.

Two members of the religious parties opposed the resolution, moved by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Rana Ansar, during the debate. However, they were absent in the house when Speaker Siraj Durrani placed it for voting and it was passed unanimously.

The mover had originally scripted the resolution with the words “to control” the population. After an extensive debate, the words were replaced with “to plan” and approved by the house.

‘We want to provide 100pc coverage through the LHW programme for which recruitments are being made’

“This assembly resolves that [the] provincial government [should] take measures to plan population and launch awareness campaigns in this regard,” said the resolution.

Ms Ansar appreciated the Sindh chief minister saying that Sindh was the first province which set up a task force to “plan” the alarmingly increasing population. However, she said the government still had to do a lot of work.

She said the population issue should be part of the curriculum.

The MQM-P lawmaker said the government should use its lady health workers’ network effectively to launch greater awareness both in women and men.

“This should be a joint initiative by all the provinces if we [are] to handle the population problem,” she said.

Rana Ansar said slain prime minister Benazir Bhutto was the first leader who had launched the programme to seriously tackle the population issue, but later no targets could be achieved.

Health minister’s assurance

Population Welfare and Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho gave a detailed account of her ministry, stating that the population welfare department was seriously engaged in its effort to make planned population a reality.

“We are working on it diligently to ensure planned and responsible parenthood,” said Dr Pechuho.

She suggested to the mover that it was not controlling the population, as the latter had suggested in her original draft, but “we are working towards planned parenthood”.

The minister said: “We have limited resources, limited area and limited water reserves, all [this] warrants that we should not have a rapid and haphazard population growth”.

She said Sindh’s population was close to 50 million out of around 210 million of the country’s population. She added that women were the ultimate sufferers of the entire scenario.

“Woman is being deemed a child-producing factory at the expense of her own health and life. We have a horrible mothers’ mortality ratio, which is 178 out of 1,000,” she said. “There should be at least three-year birth space for a mother.”

Dr Pechuho said her ministry had chalked out various strategies to achieve the targets it had set. She said originally the LHW programme was launched to provide 45 per cent health coverage. However, with the passage of time the coverage dwindled due to decrease in the original strength of LHWs because of no regular recruitment.

She added: “Now, we want to provide 100pc coverage through the LHW programme for which recruitments are being made.”

She said the LHWs were being trained for advocacy and planned parenthood involving birth spacing and improved use of contraceptives. She added that the LHWs had been prepared to administer the first injection to mothers.

Responding to a member’s earlier speech objecting to rampant surgeries in women to stop pregnancy, the minister said such an action was the last resort.

Increased use of contraceptives

She said Sindh was the only province which had registered an increase in the use of contraceptives, though by a single percentage point. She added that the rural districts of Sindh had returned the figures showing a four per cent increase in the use of contraceptives.

However, in cities such as Karachi and Hyderabad the use of contraceptives had decreased.

She said the cities such as Karachi had a greater ratio of migrant population, which too had contributed to decreasing contraceptive usage rates.

All the basic health units and rural health centres were offering delivery and family planning services where contraceptives had also been made available, she said.

The minister said the government was providing free contraceptives to 200 privately run healthcare facilities and such hospitals were located in Karachi and several other districts. She said since the health department controlled the LHW programme, plans were afoot to integrate it with the population welfare department for better planning.

MQM-P’s Mohammad Hussain said political will was needed to achieve the target of a controlled population growth. He claimed the population welfare department was not proactive to achieve its designated targets.

Women Development Minister Shehla Raza also suggested the mover rearticulate the resolution by replacing “control” with “planning” the population.

PPP’s Kulsoom Chandio and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Shehzad Qureshi said the authorities concerned should take further measures and that they would have to work hard, particularly in the rural areas.

Grand Democratic Alliance’s Nusrat Abbasi said why only women were forced to go for surgery to stop pregnancy and why not such operations were performed on men.

MMA, TLP oppose the move

Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s sole member Abdul Rasheed opposed the resolution saying: “You will face the consequences if you go against the laws of nature”.

He claimed Pakistan’s population growth was ranked 84th in the world, and was not that high.

“Pakistan will be a country of elderly people if you control its population like that,” he warned.

Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s Mohammad Qasim opposed the resolution bluntly.

He said: “Allah has promised sustenance in the Holy Quran, and no force could go against it”.

Bills

The house approved for introduction two private bills — The Sindh Water Management (Amendment) Bill, 2018, moved by Rana Ansar, and The Control of Narcotic Substances (Sindh Amendment) Bill, 2018, moved by Rabia Nizami.

PPP’s Heer Soho withdrew her adjournment motion asking the federal government to give due share of NFC award to Sindh as contemplated in Article 160 (3A) of the Constitution after the chair said an extensive debate had already been held a day earlier on another adjournment motion by Nida Khuhro.

It said the raid was conducted in a Korangi area on an intelligence report suggesting that a parcel carrying the drug was being sent overseas in the garb of a regular consignment.

“Officials of ANF police station-2 Korangi, Karachi, on a tip-off reached the office of a private courier service, intercepted the suspicious parcel and recovered drugs concealed in ladies’ fancy suits,” said an official of the force.

“The parcel was booked on the national identity card of Mirza Maqsood, son of M. Mirza Fazal Hussain, resident of Karachi, for Nesto Riza, resident of Canada. Further investigation has been initiated by the ANF,” he added.

In another action, the Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, claimed to have arrested two suspected street criminals from Model Colony, said a statement. Both the suspects, the paramilitary force said, were wanted in several cases, including street crimes and robbery.

They said the suspects named Dil Murad, aka Mahmood, and Tauseef, aka Mushki, were arrested after a raid in Model Colony area. Illegal arms, ammunition, cash and valuables were seized from them.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry suggested on Tuesday that the PPP itself remove Syed Murad Ali Shah from office for “facilitating corruption”; otherwise the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf would take “practical” measures for bringing the change that he said was imminent.

He also termed the PPP-led Sindh government “occupation of Sindh”.

The minister arrived in Karachi for a daylong visit. He spent a busy day, met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, chaired a meeting of party leaders and legislators from Sindh and held talks with leaders of coalition parties.

Assures MQM-P that promises made at the time of govt formation will be fulfilled

Amid different engagements, Mr Chaudhry maintained the same tone and sounded firm on his party’s stance against the PPP-led Sindh government.

“The PPP has actually occupied Sindh,” he said while talking to reporters at Karachi airport. “We support the democratic system and that’s why we want to give them [PPP leadership] time so they take an initiative and take resignation from Murad Ali Shah. If they don’t take action then we would be bound to take practical measures for the change that’s imminent and definitely would be witnessed by the people of Sindh.”

He accused CM Shah of “facilitating” corruption and wrongdoings of former president Asif Ali Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur and private business conglomerate Omni Group, which he said had taken out a Rs54 billion loan from the Sindh Bank with the support of Mr Shah.

“The PTI stands with the people of Sindh whose money had been found in the banks of Dubai and London instead of [being spent] on them. The wave of change, which has been witnessed by other provinces, would now be seen in Sindh. It is the right of the people of Sindh to become part of the change,” said the information minister.

He also claimed that he was approached by PPP legislators from Sindh, who wanted a change in the province and were looking towards the PTI for development in Sindh.

Asks why NAB not arresting Zardari

Later in the day, he told reporters at the residence of PTI’s Haleem Adil Shaikh that he was surprised as to why the National Accountability Bureau was not arresting Mr Zardari, Ms Talpur and CM Shah despite the fact that their names had appeared in the report of joint investigation team as “key suspects”.

“It’s quite unfortunate that the performance of NAB is not satisfactory and it’s moving at a slow pace,” he said. “Mr Zardari and Faryal Talpur have made the people of Sindh hostage while Murad Ali Shah facilitated all their wrongdoings despite holding a key office in the province and all this is documented in the JIT report. Despite all these facts [they] are not arrested yet, which is quite surprising.”

Visits MQM-P head office

Later, he visited the temporary headquarters of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan in Bahadurabad, where he discussed implementation on several decisions made between the two coalition partners a few months ago.

The federal minister brushed aside the impression of any dispute or disagreement between the two sides while reiterating the “political importance of the MQM-P”.

“MQM is a political reality and one of [the] key coalition partners of the PTI government,” Mr Chaudhry told reporters after the meeting. “In today’s meeting, we have discussed and reviewed the memorandum of understanding which we signed at the time of formation of the government. Several points of the MoU have already been executed while others will also meet the same fate soon.”

Representing the MQM-P, deputy convener Kanwar Naveed Jameel reminded the federal minister of promises of funds from the Centre for a public university in Hyderabad and other development schemes in urban Sindh.

",2019-01-16,"MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider on Tuesday claimed that the issues relating to the environmental and economic concerns arising out of Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project (NJHP) had been amicably settled with the federal government.

Speaking on the floor of the Legislative Assembly, he said the federal government had constituted a high-powered committee after its attention was drawn by the AJK government in black and white to address these issues.

The committee that includes representatives of important institutions had agreed to all four points raised by the AJK government and had also dispatched its favourable report to the office of Prime Minister of Pakistan, he added.

The AJK premier maintained that his government had taken serious stock of environmental and economic impact of NJHP that emerged after its commissioning. “We constituted a committee of the heads of all parliamentary parties, apart from convening a conference of all stakeholders, including senior political figures from Muzaffarabad,” he said, adding that these steps had led the federal government to constitute the committee.

Mr Haider said the NJHP was a national project and the Kashmiris had always offered sacrifices in the interest of Pakistan.

“We will continue to do so in future because a strong and prosperous Pakistan is the nucleus of our hopes and aspirations,” he said, expressing the hope that the federal government would provide full support for mitigation of environmental and other issues in the light of the report, prepared by its committee.

He informed the house that the reservations about Kohala Hydropower Project had also been conveyed to the federal government and he was hopeful that those would also be addressed.

The AJK premier rubbished Indian government’s allegation that Pakistan was non-serious in dialogue as the ‘biggest lie’, and said Delhi had always used dialogue as a ploy to kill time and defuse international pressure.

Over the past seven decades, there had been numerous sessions of dialogue between the two sides, but India never showed seriousness to make the process meaningful and result-oriented, he said.

He seized the opportunity to praise Nawaz Sharif, saying his services for strengthening democracy in Pakistan were invaluable.

",2019-01-16,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court will take up on Jan 21 appeals filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against the acquittal of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in the Flagship Investment reference and for enhancement of his sentence from seven years to 14 years in the Al-Azizia reference.

A two-judge IHC bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani will also hear an appeal of Mr Sharif against his conviction in the Al-Azizia reference as well as a petition seeking suspension of the sentence in this reference the same day.

An accountability court had on Dec 24 last year convicted Mr Sharif in the Al-Azizia/Hill Metal Establishment reference, sentenced him to seven years in prison and fined him Rs1.5 billion and $25 million. Accountability court judge Mohammad Arshad Malik, however, acquitted the former prime minister in the Flagship Investment reference.

Mr Sharif’s appeal argued that certain observations made by the accountability court judge were against the “principles governing administration of criminal justice in Pakistan, and of the principle of fair trial as guaranteed to all citizens of the country by Article 10-A of the Constitution”. It pointed out that the judge had used a word “beneficial owner” for the accused despite the fact that this word was never mentioned in the National Accountability Ordinance.

On the other hand, NAB argued in its appeal that the accountability court did not consider evidence in the Flagship Investment reference and in the Al-Azizia reference. The bureau argued that the court took a lenient view and awarded seven-year sentence to the former premier, instead of maximum 14 years.

Four women died on the spot while the fifth women, who had received serious burn wounds, succumbed to her injuries at the hospital, DawnNewsTV reported. The bodies have been handed over to the families of the deceased.

Eyewitnesses told DawnNewsTV that the fire broke out on the ground floor of the house and moved upwards to engulf the upper storey.

The homeowner, Malik Abdul Ghani, while narrating the incident to DawnNewsTV, laid the blame on rescue services: ""They did not arrive timely and as a result five women, including my daughter are now dead.""

The aggrieved father said his daughter was due to be married on Thursday, whereas today, a mehendi ceremony was going to take place.

When the fire broke out, between 40 and 50 guests were present within the home. Some had to jump out from the upper floor in order to save their lives.

According to New Town Assistant Superintendent Police (ASP) Ziauddin, the source of the fire remains a mystery and it is being investigated whether the cause was a short circuit in the wiring, a gas leakage, or if it was a case of arson.

",2019-01-15,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Bahria Town's offer to deposit Rs250 billion to avoid legal proceedings for illegally acquiring land for its projects in Karachi, Islamabad and Murree.

An implementation bench of the apex court was hearing a case pertaining to the implementation on a May 4, SC verdict against Bahria Town. Under the order, the court had barred M/s Bahria Town Karachi from selling any plot or constructed apartment in the housing scheme on the outskirts of the port city, declaring the grant of land to the Malir Develop­ment Authority and its exchange with the land of the private land developers illegal and void ab initio.

At the outset of today's hearing, a counsel on behalf of Bahria Town offered to submit Rs200 billion to waive off charges against the real estate developer.

Justice Azmat Saeed, who was heading the three-member bench, reminded the counsel that a fine of Rs285 billion had been imposed on Bahria Town in 2004. ""If the fine money is increased by 40 per cent, it will amount to Rs300bn.""

""This is not a suitable way to deal with [the apex court],"" Justice Saeed said, reprimanding the lawyer. ""We may ask the National Accountability Bureau to file a reference.""

The counsel sought one week's time to file a reply. Justice Saeed granted the plea and directed Bahria Town to submit written offers in all the three cases.

""Our mistake was not that big,"" the counsel argued.

""Mistake is supposed to be of one or two kanals, not of thousands of acres,"" the judge replied.

The implementation bench was formed after the court had dropped the review petitions filed against its May 4 judgement barring Bahria Town Karachi from selling any plots or constructed apartments.

In its May 4 judgement, the court had declared the grant of land to the Malir Development Authority (MDA) and its exchange with the land of Bahria Town illegal and void. It had also directed NAB to continue its probe into the matters of the developer.

During the last hearing in the case, the bench had ordered the bureau to file separate references on a series of matters stemming from the Bahria Town Karachi project, including the arrears of three MDA projects.

During an earlier hearing, the court had reprimanded NAB, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) and the administration of Bahria Town, over what it termed their ""non-cooperation"" in implementing a ruling of the apex court.

Asghar told the court that an investigation report prepared in 2015 had held the then chief minister responsible. However, the chief minister's name was excluded in a second report that was submitted in 2016. The JIT, concluding that then chief minister did not have the authority to transfer the land, recommended that that land be retrieved and criminal proceedings be initiated against Sharif, then secretary to chief minister Syed Javed Iqbal Bukhari, the legal heirs of Deewan Ghulam Qutub Din, assistant administrator of Auqaf Pakpattan during 1969 and 1986 as well as the patwaris of the area ""where these irregularities and illegalities were committed"".

Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar who was heading the three-member bench hearing the case today said that ""times have changed and a third report will not be prepared"".

""Why was this land allotted illegally?"" the chief justice inquired, warning that ""no one will be able to escape if an investigation is launched"".

Sharif's counsel Barrister Munawar Iqbal said that the former premier had rejected the allegations earlier.

""You're playing the role of [the person] more loyal to the king than the king himself,"" Justice Nisar remarked. ""We may order the Anti-Corruption Establishment to file a complaint.""

",2019-01-15,"Two suspected members of the militant Islamic State group allegedly linked to the 2013 abduction of former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's son, Ali Haider Gilani, were killed in a pre-dawn raid on a 'militant hideout' in Faisalabad on Tuesday, a Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official said.

CTD official Rai Tahir identified the two militants as Adeel Hafeez and Usman Haroon. He said both were killed during an intense shootout in the raid conducting by security officials.

Tahir said officials had, in the past, foiled other attacks the pair had plotted, adding that they were also behind the killing of two intelligence officials in recent years as well as other high-profile crimes.

The two militants were also linked to the 2011 Al Qaeda abduction of an American development worker, Warren Weinstein, the official said. Weinstein, who was taken from Lahore, was accidentally killed in a United States drone strike in 2015 on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He provided no specific information about the role the two had in Weinstein's case.

The American worker's accidental death was announced by Washington in 2015. President Barack Obama at the time said he took full responsibility for US counter-terror missions and offered his condolences to families of the hostages.

After the Sept 11 attacks in the United States, Washington aggressively targeted militant hideouts in neighbouring Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal regions, killing local and foreign militants. Pakistan considers US drone strikes a violation of its sovereignty, while the US accuses Pakistan of providing safe havens for militants. Pakistan has always denied the charge, saying it acts against militants without discrimination.

Speaking to reporters after the nearly two-hour-long meeting, Shahbaz said the opposition leaders had decided to form a committee to devise a joint strategy and deal with the government on various issues.

The committee, which according to Shahbaz will have representation from all opposition parties, will also be responsible for holding negotiations with the government on the issue of an extension in the tenure of military courts. ""The combined opposition will adopt whatever path is in the national interest,"" he added.

The leader of the opposition also criticised the ""worst incompetence"" of the PTI government and once again termed as ""cronyism"" the government's move to award the Mohmand dam contract to a consortium led by Descon, which he alleged was owned by a sitting adviser to the prime minister.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari — who attended the meeting along with his father, former president Asif Ali Zardari — in his remarks said the opposition's human and democratic rights were under attack from all sides by the government, but the opposition leaders were ""not ready to compromise"" on these two rights.

Earlier on Tuesday, business in the lower house was disrupted again after the opposition lodged a strong protest against the deputy speaker's decision not to hold a re-vote when an opposition MNA introduced a bill pertaining to the quota of judges in the Islamabad High Court.

Parliamentary Secretary for Law Maleeka Bokhari opposed the bill, but Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri held a verbal vote and subsequently rejected the bill after it appeared to have been voted against.

Kamran then challenged the vote and the deputy speaker ordered a headcount. The headcount revealed that 96 MNAs opposed the bill, while 94 were in favour of it. Therefore, the NA decided against the move.

",2019-01-15,"Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry warned on Tuesday that if the PPP is unable to bring change to Sindh and the chief minister does not resign, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government ""will need to take practical steps"".

Chaudhry, while speaking to reporters upon arrival in Karachi, explained that the government wants ""the PPP to bring change themselves"", and for a new chief minister to take the place of Murad Shah, a senior PPP leader who was named in the joint investigation team's report in the fake accounts case.

""We want to first give them an opportunity [to bring change]. If this opportunity is not availed, and they do not take advantage of it, and Murad Shah does not resign, then we will certainly need to take practical steps here,"" he said.

When asked about the possibility of the PTI forming a forward bloc in the PPP to remove the provincial government, Chaudhry responded that any person who carries the pain of the people of Sindh in his heart will want change in the province, no matter what party he belongs to.

He said that even 'serious' members of the PPP wanted change, adding that when this issue began, PPP members had themselves contacted the PTI and asked it to step forward for change.

""It is also a right of the people of Sindh to see the wave of change that the three other provinces have seen, that all of Pakistan has seen. It is the right of the people of Sindh that they become part of this change,"" he added.

The federal minister pointed out that Sindh had not contributed to the National Finance Commission award for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) although the ""other provinces and the federal government had given their share for its development"".

The PTI-run Federal, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments had decided on Jan 4 to jointly provide the equivalent of 3pc of the federal divisible pool for uplifting Fata after its merger with KP.

Chaudhry claimed that although the PPP paints itself as a ""vision of democracy"", when the time for action came, it disassociated itself from Fata.

He alleged that Sindh's money would ""not be spent on the poor people"" of the province. ""It will go to the Omni Group and into branches of the Zardari Gropu of companies. The painful thing is that Sindh's funds are being spent in London and Dubai.""

He claimed that those who are ""closest to the people will talk about change"", and that a large majority of the PPP MPAs would side with the PTI.

The tenure of Zardari's monarchy has come to an end, similarly, the Sindh's lease to Omni group has also expired, the minister said.

""I am astonished that NAB still hasn't arrested Asif, Faryal and Murad Ali Shah despite the fact that the watchdog has to complete the probe in two months.""

He alleged that the ""residents of Bilawal House"" and ""the man in CM House [in Karachi]"" are beneficiary of the fake accounts. He also accused the watchdog of showing leniency.

Chaudhry said no doubt the 18th Amendment has several positive impacts, including devolution of power which enabled transfer of large funds to provinces. ""But the point is, where did these funds go?""

""They [PPP] are demanding funds form themselves and not for the people of Sindh. Whenever the rulers in Sindh are asked about accountability, suddenly the democracy becomes ‘vulnerable’,"" the minister remarked.

PTI-PPP tussle heats up

A tussle between the PPP and PTI over money laundering and the fake bank accounts case has heated up in recent days, with the ruling party in Sindh accusing the Centre of attempting to dislodge the provincial government and warning it of dire consequences if any attempt is made to arrest top party cadre.

Chaudhry's two-day trip to Sindh scheduled for December was shelved after Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar's observations during an earlier hearing of the fake accounts case indicated that the PTI was trying to topple the PPP government.

Chaudhry was allegedly tasked by the prime minister to meet leaders of political parties apart from the PPP during his earlier trip to Sindh and seek their support for dislodging the PPP government.

The information minister, however, has denied that his party wishes to dislodge the PPP government. ""We do not want to dislodge the PPP government in Sindh but want to forge consensus on the demand for resignation of Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to ensure fair trial of Asif Ali Zardari and company,” he had said earlier, adding that the PTI had no intention to impose governor's rule in Sindh or repeal the 18th Amendment.

The information minister had explained during an earlier press conference that his visit had been cancelled by Prime MInister Imran Khan to reject the impression that the Centre wanted to topple the Sindh government.

PPP is the majority party in the Sindh Assembly with 99 seats while the PTI and its allies have a total of 64 seats. The PTI requires 18 more members to outnumber the PPP to form its government in the province.

",2019-01-15,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday in its verdict in a suo motu case on the increasing population said that the government, civil society and religious scholars should all take steps to tackle the issue.

A three-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ijazul Ahsan, was hearing the case. Population control is the latest campaign the SC has extended its support to.

According to the 2017 census, which was held after a gap of 19 years, the country’s population is approximately 207,774,520 living in 32,205,111 households. The results show that Pakistan has moved up the ladder becoming the fifth most populous nation only behind India, China, the United States and Indonesia. Top government officials have decided to reduce the population growth rate of 2.4 per cent per annum to 1.5pc.

The SC in its verdict today observed that an increasing population is a stress on the country's resources and likened the growth to an explosion.

""We need a campaign to decrease the population,"" the court said. ""It is a question of the future of our coming generations.""

""The entire nation must stand united on the matter of population planning,"" said chief justice Nisar, who has termed unbridled population growth as the ""most disastrous issue"" for Pakistan.

In yesterday's hearing, the court was told by the health secretary that a demographic survey is conducted every five years. The last one was in 2018 and its results bore little difference compared to the survey before that, the secretary told the bench.

The chief justice asked about progress made on its earlier orders, to which the secretary had responded that a report was submitted.

",2019-01-15,"Writers, journalists and civil society activists gathered outside the Lahore Press Club on Monday in protest against the ban on Nandita Das film Manto.

“Manto was screened all over the world and it won an award in Bangladesh but it was banned in the writer’s own country,” lamented journalist and secretary general of Manto Memorial Society Saeed Ahmed.

He said Manto himself was not treated well in Pakistan and when he came to Lahore after the Partition, his entry was banned into the radio station. The ‘new Pakistan’ under the PTI government was treating him the same way as he was treated in old Pakistan 10 years back, he said, appealing to the government to lift the ban on the movie. He said it was a countrywide protest as similar demonstrations against the ban on Manto were being held in Karachi and Peshawar.

Calling for the freedom of expression, painter Salima Hashmi said: “Manto was kept deprived of this right in his life and after so many years, he is still facing the same oppression.”

She said Manto was the most read Urdu prose writer in the world, condemning the attitude of the government towards him.

Veteran journalist Hussain Naqi said Manto was the most-read and most-translated Pakistani writer who was known all over the world and banning the film made on his life could not be justified from any point of view. He also condemned the alleged government action against the Manto festival scheduled to be held at Alhamra Art Centre.

“One of the best works on Partition and subsequent years are in the form of Manto’s short stories which are as important as poetry of Faiz Sahib,” he added.

Abdul Waheed of the Progressive Writers Association said the ban on film showed Manto was as unacceptable for the state institution as he was 70 years back which exposed the stagnation of society. He said the nation had not progressed socially, morally and intellectually.

Farooq Tariq of the Awami Workers Party praised Nandita Das’s film on Manto, saying the protest was against the ban on the movie that was screened across the world except in Pakistan. Writer Husssain Majrooh also spoke.

",2019-01-15,"THE PTI-run Federal, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments decided on Jan 4 to jointly provide equivalent to three per cent of the federal divisible pool for uplifting the erstwhile Fata region following its merger with KP.

The decision is stated to have been prompted by the delay in formation of the National Finance Commission (NFC) and expected reluctance by Sindh and Balochistan to tinker with the 7th NFC award. When Fata was a federal territory, provinces had opposed diversion of funds from the NFC’s divisible pool to finance the region’s development needs.

Stipulated to be enforced from the next financial year, the decision is projected to raise Rs108 billion, including Punjab’s contribution of Rs38.3bn The ad-hoc decision indicates that it will be tough for the PTI government to forge a consensus for the next NFC award.

Since the PTI has come into power, the Sindh government has been criticising some of the federal government’s proposals for exceeding the constitutional limits.

On Jan 5, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah told the prime minister’s Special Assistant on Power Shahzad Qasim, who called on him in Karachi, that the decision of the Federal Cabinet Committee on Energy to reduce the life of solar and wind projects from 20 to 15 years was illegal and unconstitutional. He pointed out that the Council of Common Interests was the only constitutional forum to decide electricity policy issues and sought withdrawal of the decision.

In this age of networking, unilateral and arbitrary actions can deliver, at best, only partially

During the same week, the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Reforms demanded that Rs9bn donations collected for two mega-dams be diverted for building small and medium ones for water-starved Balochistan to support agriculture and livestock development and create job opportunities in the province.

The panel felt the collected amount was meagre, considering the cost of the Diamer-Bhasha dam was estimated at Rs1 trillion and Mohmand dam at Rs300bn. With the same amount, the committee estimated that the number of dams planned for Balochistan could be increased from 100 to 500.

Unlike big dams for which foreign loans are required, the Rs9bn could best be invested in the province to bring virgin lands under plough and boost output of fruits and meat for exports.

The building of the mega-dams has also been opposed by Sindh where the provincial government has announced its intention to set up two desalination plants for Karachi, owing to water scarcity, both for household use and irrigation purposes. Sindh wants a policy shift to modern methods of water conservation including increased usage of drip and sprinkler systems.

Even within the ranks of the PTI and its coalition partners, there seems to be no consensus on the party’s heavy agenda.

The PML-Q , an important coalition partner, shares views with PML-N on the creation of Bahawalpur province and the party does not subscribe to the creation of South Punjab as envisaged by PTI.

Finally, the PTI’s recent perceived move to impose governor rule in Sindh and destabilise Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah’s government was not supported by coalition partner MQM-P and fellow traveller Sindh Democratic Alliance leader Pir Saheb Pagara. PTI has failed to recognise the sway of participatory federal democracy over the country’s politics after the 18th Constitutional Amendment.

A second mini-budget within a short span of time, due later this month, reflects PTI’s ad hoc-ism that is not a part of an implementable long-term plan

To quote Fitch,’political headwinds are growing in Pakistan’ which, it may be added, requires consensus building for resolving agitating problems so far defying solutions. A second mini-budget within a short span of time, due later this month, reflects PTI’s ad hoc-ism that is not a part of an implementable long-term plan.

Official data bears this out. During July-December 2018, the net dollar reserves of the State Bank have fallen from $10.2bn to $7.3bn and those held by commercial banks are stagnant at around $6.5bn.

Simultaneously, budgetary borrowings have soared by 86pc to Rs722bn owing to a shortfall of Rs112bn in targeted federal tax revenue and surge in non-development spending. Though the trade gap is reducing, the increase in exports and home remittances are not fast enough to plug the hole in external sector accounts to a comfortable level anytime soon. There is little prospect for an export rebound, says an international research agency.

As it is, Prime Minister Imran Khan has taken over the reins of the government in difficult times. He has to grapple with enormous domestic and external challenges.

No doubt the PTI manifesto promises the nation wide ranging, virtuous reforms, but for that to happen, economic agents, bureaucracy, sub-federating units, district governments and farmers have to be energised with widest political and civil society support.

The entire nation needs to be mobilised on a practical common agenda and a coherent strategy for resolving deep-seated problems facing the country. In this age of networking, unilateral and arbitrary actions can deliver, at best, only partially.

Mr Khan has succeeded in securing financial support from Saudi Arabia ($6.2bn), UAE ( expected $6.2bn) and trade financing ($1.5bn) from the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation amounting to $13.9bn. Another $2bn has been pledged by China raising the total expected borrowings to $15.9bn in six months.

But the festering problem still remains: there is no significant boost in foreign exchange earnings insight to service ballooning external debts. External sector pressures are not expected to go away.

And business confidence is sinking in a rudderless economy despite Mr Khan’s pledge to provide an enabling environment for wealth creation.

",2019-01-15,"XENOPHOBIA is unfounded fear of foreigners. It often results in actions against them that defy logic. It occurs globally, with both developing and developed countries experiencing it. And that seems like an incomplete list.

But there is a difference between ordinary people and the state exhibiting xenophobia. The former causes much damage too, like attacks on foreigners. But given the huge powers that states enjoy, state xenophobia can cause much greater harm to foreigners as they adopt misplaced policies to eliminate external threats. The US state xenophobia under Trump harms both foreigners and US interests.

Also read: The age of xenophobia

Xenophobia is not new to Pakistani society. But its state institutions have often adopted xenophobic policies, especially in the last few months. Pakistan clearly faces external threats and espionage, like most states globally. But it also faces major opportunities in interacting externally, including with those states from which it experiences threats. Smart states balance the threats and opportunities by basing concerns about foreigners on strong evidence and adopting calibrated responses that minimise the threats but not the opportunities. Unfortunately, such smart analysis seems missing from our responses in many cases.

Our institutions have often adopted shortsighted policies.

Only recently, Pakistan expelled 18 INGOs without assigning any specific reasons on a case-by-case basis. The backlash against INGOs originates from the 2011 allegations that one INGO supported Shakeel Afridi in conducting a vaccination campaign to track down Osama bin Laden. No proof was presented of the INGO’s role. The non-calibrated nature of the action against INGOs can be gauged by the fact that this particular INGO has not been expelled but 18 others having nothing to do with that incident have been.

Explore: Pressure on INGOs

The official press release vaguely refers to a failure to meet registration requirements and involvement in unauthorised activities. But apparently, none of the expelled INGOs were given any specific reasons about where they went wrong. Write-ups supporting the expulsion also mention vague ‘reasons’, such as their involvement in surveys and geo-tagging. These are standard development-sector practices followed globally by INGOs and even well-equipped state agencies. Expulsion is an extreme step to be taken only if there is concrete proof that an INGO was involved in illegal practices. So far, there is little proof that such a rule of law-based outlook was employed.

Finally, there is the provision that all expelled INGOs can reapply after six months. Why would the state entertain their applications just after six months if solid proof of wrongdoing by them was found? By expelling them on flimsy grounds, we have unnecessarily lost millions of dollars of funding, thousands of jobs and international repute.

Deeming dual citizens a security risk, a recent court verdict has asked the state to develop laws to restrict their hiring in the bureaucracy. Legal minds ask if it is the job of courts to identify security risks. But even if the executive makes such a review, it should be based on solid proof.

Dual nationality: a conflict of interest for bureaucrats?

Dual citizens have been working in the bureaucracy for several decades. How many incidents have there been of them facilitating foreign states at the expense of Pakistan? Foreign states can easily bribe willing ordinary Pakistani citizens to do so despite the ban. Expat Pakistanis with their wealth, education and goodwill for Pakistan are an asset. Both the executive and courts frequently appeal to them to donate funds in times of financial crunch.

Another verdict has declared Indian content on TV a cultural threat. Again, some legal minds ask whether the judiciary should be analysing cultural threats. And how would even the executive define and measure cultural threat? The frequency of objectionable scenes in Indian movies has increased with time. But that is an issue more with English movies, and simple censorship of specific offensive scenes rather than a blanket ban on all Indian content would seem a more calibrated response.

Rational states recognise that ordinary families and communities are quite capable of shielding impressionable young minds from cultural exposures they deem harmful and that the blunt use of state bans in the cultural arena is unnecessary. There is clearly a high demand for Indian stuff in Pakistan and vice versa. So, similarly, the Indian ban on Pakistani artists is highly deplorable.

State policies are expected to be based on careful analysis and facts. When states also start acting like impulsive citizens, the space for rationality and tolerance reduces fast in the country. While world powers have deplorably contributed to isolating Pakistan, our own ill-conceived reactions are making us even more isolated and paranoid.

",2019-01-15,"AS things move along, the need for greater transparency and disclosure on what exactly the government is signing onto is growing.

The eighth Joint Cooperation Committee meeting on CPEC between Pakistani and Chinese government delegations was held in December, but to this day, there is very little known about the details of what the government of Pakistan has consented to do.

Read more: What do Pakistan and China want from CPEC going forward?

In addition, we have seen $2bn land in the State Bank as a ‘deposit’, following a visit to Saudi Arabia by the prime minister accompanied by a high-powered ministerial entourage, with promises of another billion to come soon, and a ‘deferred payment’ facility to underwrite a portion of the country’s oil imports.

Yet, not a word has been uttered about what has been promised in return. Likewise, we are now hearing of another $3bn worth of ‘deposits’ to be made by the UAE, but once again, there is not a word about what is expected in return. No details have even been released about the terms on which these ‘deposits’ have come, whether on their tenure or return.

Now we are hearing of a massive investment from Saudi Arabia to be made in an ‘oil city’ in Gwadar. What exactly is going on here, many wish to ask.

Foreign investment is welcome in Pakistan, but in most cases it comes under a policy framework that is transparently known, has been debated in cabinet at least, and with the terms available to all. Some sort of a bilateral framework between two countries exclusively is also fine, but it should be known to all what exactly is being built, what concessions are being granted, how Pakistan’s long-term economic interests are being served, and so on.

Foreign investment that creates jobs, transfers skills and imparts dynamism to Pakistan’s economy and spurs its markets is welcome. But investment that seeks to create a transshipment enclave, or provides exclusive access rights and privileges to one group of investors only is of debatable merit.

When government ministers are asked for details, they refuse to entertain the request on the grounds that the other party — whether China or Saudi Arabia — prefers discretion in this matter.

Discretion is fine and has its place in deal-making of the sort that is under way between the states, but since sprawling Pakistani interests are involved, transparency and disclosure requirements must not be jettisoned.

The feeling right now appears to be that the government, in its desperation to avoid the stringent terms of an IMF programme, is signing every dotted line that is placed before it by foreign powers such as China and Saudi Arabia, in return for a bailout that will last a few months at best.

This is not the kind of policymaking that the PTI promised the country in the run-up to the election.

",2019-01-15,"TAXILA: Due to lack of maintenance, a 17th century stepwell in Wah’s Sher Shah Park, locally known as Losar Baoli, is facing deterioration and the retaining wall to the west of the well has started to crumble.

The well was one of many constructed in the 17th century by the Mughals along the Grand Trunk Road to provide fresh drinking water to travellers. Such wells were constructed every three miles.

The wells were 100ft by 6ft and had a main entrance. Unlike the common method of pulling out water with a bucket tied to a pulley, these wells had stairs which had a platform at three different depths so that people could stop to fetch water at various levels.

The wells provided water to travellers and their horses.

The wells became obsolete with time and many do not exist now. One of the wells was included in the Sher Shah Park when it was established.

Quaid-i-Azam University Taxila Institute of Asia Civilisation’s former director Dr Mohammad Ashraf Khan said stepwells were first introduced by Ashoka in the third century BC in the region to facilitate pilgrims and travellers along highways.

He added that the route used to connect the Valley of Ganges with the northwest region of the subcontinent.

Dr Khan said such wells were constructed and maintained by the Mughals and that they were also used by their armies.

“These wells and inns were built to facilitate pilgrims, travellers and armies. Royal messengers and horse riders would stay and rest at Baolies and would replace their horses so they could deliver important letters. Sometimes, the riders were changed as well,” he said.

Officials of the Punjab Department of Archaeology told Dawn that one of the walls of the well collapsed in 1990 and was restored by the authorities.

However, the authorities concerned did not undertake maintenance work which led to the collapse of a major portion of the wall on the western side.

They said that the Punjab government released funds to the Punjab Department of Archaeology’s sub-regional office during the fiscal year 2016-17 for the restoration and the preservation of the site. However the funds lapsed as the department did not execute the project.

Department of Archaeology Deputy Director Irshad Hussain confirmed that the department had gotten funds for the maintenance of the site.

“The funds were not enough to pay for the preservation and restoration of the site so the project was shelved,” he told Dawn.

He added that a partial restoration would not address the issue and that the project will not be executed till the required funds are received.

",2019-01-15,"GUJAR KHAN: Despite a ban, dog fighting remains one of the most popular activities in the Potohar region and an open secret.

Affluent families from Kharian, Bewal, Jabbar, Mirpur and Dhadial spend large sums of money on bull terrier breeding.

A puppy from a bull terrier who has won fights is sold for between Rs50,000 and Rs200,000, according to Chaudhry Khadim, who had come all the way from Mirpur to watch the much-awaited dog fight in Gujar Khan on Sunday.

A buffalo is set aside exclusively for providing milk to the bull terrier, who is also fed pure desi ghee during training.

Bashir Mughal, who hails from Daultala and is famous for breeding bull terriers, told Dawn that one puppy is assigned three trainers. A dog’s routine involves a 10-km jog twice a day to improve its stamina.

Another breeder, Mohammad Zakir, said his dog had recently won a fight and that he has been offered Rs1 million for it but he has refused to sell the dog.

“I bought him in Quetta and love him like family,” he said.

The Sunday fight near Gujar Khan was attended by thousands of people from Punjab, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and even people from outside the country.

The dogs were driven to the venue in cars and were given VIP treatment.

Some of the better known fighter dogs include Bubloo, Moon, Heera, Moti, Doggar, Koka, Shankar, Kaala and Jockey.

Mohammad Bashir, who attends dog fights regularly, told Dawn that some dog owners either rub bitter tasting ointments on their dogs so other dogs would not hold their bite for long, oil so they cannot get a grip and sometimes even poison to kill rival dogs.

That is why two referees are tasked with properly washing the dogs before they are allowed to fight, he said.

Dog fighting has been prohibited by the district administration and the police.

The hosts of these events organise them in secret, deep inside forests and other remote locations. Those attending the event are never given an exact location and are given the address to a neighbouring location.

The matches continue from morning till sunset and are filmed so they can be uploaded on social media, where they are avidly followed.

PIA spokesperson Mashood Tajwar told Dawn that a travel agent from Lahore had booked the pilgrims’ seats but did not pay for their confirmation in time, leading to the cancellation of their bookings.

He added that the travel agency was a defaulter that owed the PIA Rs25 million, but had sought a temporary stay order from a senior civil judge.

",2019-01-15,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development joined the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration in an operation to retrieve 102 kanals in Valley Zone V belonging to the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) that had been occupied since 1999.

Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Overseas Pakistanis Syed Zulfikar Bukhari supervised the operation alongside Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat.

Mr Bukhari told the press: “The writ of the state will be established at all costs and those involved in grabbing land belonging to Pakistani expatriates will be taken to task as per law.”

He added: “We will not tolerate such an illegal activity and in this regard measures are being taken to avoid reoccupation of the state’s land by the mafia.”

Mr Bukhari said a boundary wall will be constructed around the valley and police pickets will be set up as well. The concerned ministry will also ensure that the area is monitored so it cannot be occupied again.

According to a ministry spokesperson, the valley, spread over 5,000 kanals, was approved in 1999 and 90pc of the allotments have already been made.

The retrieved land will also be allotted to overseas Pakistanis based on merit.

Mr Bukhari told this agency that Pakistani

expatriates were constantly raising the issue of their occupied property in the country, and complaints statistics had also shown that this was a major issue facing expats.

In this regard, he said the ministry is planning to set up a fast-track court in the capital to retrieve expatriates’ property from land grabbers. The court aims to provide instant relief to litigants, as the number of such cases is gradually increasing.

“Accordingly, a summary has been submitted to the Ministry of Law and Justice to materialise the initiative during the current year,” he said.

The special court will be designed to ensure the disposal of cases within a month after the admittance of petitions, he said, adding that it will be established after the necessary legislation with full constitutional cover.

Mr Bukhari said both ministries will meet next week to discuss the technical and legal issues facing overseas Pakistanis in the prevailing judicial system and the setting up of the aforementioned court.

The establishment of the court will serve as a pilot project, on the basis of which similar courts would then be set up in other cities, he said.

",2019-01-15,"ISLAMABAD: Two Capital Development Authority (CDA) directorates are at loggerheads over who is responsible for controlling unauthorised construction in the city.

More than a hundred housing societies are operating illegally in Islamabad, and most of them have taken over land reserved for graveyards, schools and other civic amenities, creating problems for people who have built homes there because timely action was not taken against their operators.

In a letter, the housing societies directorate recently asked building control to take action against sponsors of illegal housing schemes and against schemes whose layouts were cancelled.

Pointing out illegal societies in zones II and V and in E-11, the housing societies directorate asked various organisations to take action against housing society operators.

In response, the directorate of building control II on Monday said the issue of housing societies needed to be quelled on solid grounds in a practical way.

List of illegal housing schemes may be referred to DC, spokesperson says

In a letter, Deputy Director Usman Rasheed Khan said that under zoning regulations, after the clearance of the no-objection certificate, every sponsor of a society must seek approval of engineering design and specifications of utility services from the director general planning.

Authorised CDA officers are also to inspect the site during the development of the scheme and record their observations.

The letter stated: “Major issue in housing schemes is that they have developed their scheme/society in complete deviation of approved layout plan and majority of societies has no obtained NOC from CDA. The question now arises that how they have undertaken the infrastructure work without obtaining NOC form the CDA and if they have obtained necessary approval from the CDA then how they developed in complete deviation of approved LOP.”

The construction of buildings comes later, the letter said, adding that if the aforementioned system had been in place “this whole mess would not have been created”.

The official wrote that if the society had been properly supervised by the concerned CDA officers when infrastructure was being developed, ensuring that housing societies and schemes were being developed according to their approved layout plans and no deviations had taken place “then no violation at site would occur”.

The building control letter advised the housing societies directorate to ensure that CDA officers visit schemes that are now in the construction stage to check whether infrastructure is being developed according to engineering standards and, if this system is in place, they would make sure development is carried out according to the approved layout plan.

The letter also referenced various regulations that empower the housing societies directorate to deal with societies that violate layout plans. It added that building control II was established in 2017 to exercise building control in approved housing societies “but unfortunately no requisite staff has yet been posted despite various efforts”.

It added that the understaffed directorate could not carry out fieldwork to check unauthorised construction, and also called for a complete ban on construction in illegal housing societies.

CDA spokesperson Safdar Shah said the list of all illegal housing schemes may be referred to the deputy commissioner for the imposition of section 144 to ban construction in the limits of the Islamabad Capital Territory.

He said the CDA was not restricted to just issued notices, and action has been taken against the operators of several housing societies.

",2019-01-15,"LAHORE: A group of lawyers representing Faisalabad Regional Police Officer Ghulam Mahmood Dogar on Monday audaciously manhandled a man from the opposite party in the court of an additional district and sessions judge hearing an appeal of the RPO against the alleged illegal shifting of his children from Pakistan by his Canadian national wife.

During the hearing, the police officer’s lawyers, who were over a dozen in number, kept abusing and provoking Waseem Ijaz, a guarantor in the children’s custody matter on behalf of their Canadian mother Mirjam Aberras Lahdeaho, despite repeated warnings by AD&SJ Adnan Tariq.

Senior lawyer Hina Jillani represented Mr Ijaz.

Soon after Ms Jillani and Mr Dogar’s counsel Syed Ali Hassan concluded their arguments, the aggressive lawyers pounced upon Mr Ijaz and started roughing him up in the presence of the judge, slapping him in the face and punching him ruthlessly.

The lawyers also manhandled Muhammad Akram, an office-assistant of Ms Jillani and snatched his mobile phone when he tried to make a footage of the violence using its camera.

The judge was shocked to see the violence as his efforts to calm down the lawyers failed.

Ms Jillani and her associates rescued both Mr Ejaz and Mr Akram from the lawyers.

Meanwhile, the judge left for his chamber to dictate the decision of the proceedings.

Earlier, in his arguments, Mr Dogar’s counsel took a plea that the Canadian lady took away the children with her unlawfully.

He said Mr Ejaz had deposited surety bonds before a guardian court when the custody of the minors was given to the mother.

He argued that the guarantor was responsible, under the law, to ensure production of the minors before the court.

He also argued that the court could not proceed on the appeal of the father without the production of the children.

He said Mr Ejaz also possessed Canadian passport and there was a possibility that he would also abscond.

The counsel asked the court to take custody of Mr Ejaz’s passport and also place order placing of his name on exit control list (ECL).

Mr Dogar told the court that the passports of the children were with him but their mother got them removed with “criminal assistance” of the Canadian Embassy.

On the other side, Ms Jillani argued that the guarantor was not supposed to ensure production of the respondent’s children as the surety deposited by him was meant for obtaining guardianship certificate from the guardian court.

She said the court should have issued a notice to the mother of the children instead of issuing arrest warrants of the guarantor.

After hearing the arguments, the judge directed Mr Ejaz to surrender his passport with the court and ensure production of the minors on Jan 24.

Ms Lahdeaho had arrived in Pakistan last year to get custody of her children back, with a claim that her police officer husband brought them from Canada to Pakistan secretly and unlawfully. Mr Dogar had produced the minors – Qasim Dogar (17) and Jaffer Dogar (13) -- before the Lahore High Court after she filed a habeas corpus petition.

Ms Lahdeaho, who also embraced Islam and was given a Muslim name Maryam, said she married Dogar on March 6, 1997, in Lahore and stayed in Pakistan for over 12 years along with three children before moving to Canada as permanent residents in 2009. Zahra Dogar, 19, was their third child.

The lady had flown back to Canada on June 16, 2018, after a guardian court decided the custody of children in her favour.

Both the treasury and the opposition unanimously adopted amendment to the rules of procedure of the Punjab Assembly house empowering the speaker to issue production order of an MPA detained by the law enforcement agencies.

The house also adopted the Punjab Right to Public Services Bill of 2018, while two other bills - the Punjab Domestic Workers Bill of 2018 and the Punjab Prevention of Conflict of Interest Bill of 2018- were postponed by the speaker until January 21 on the request of the opposition.

Opposition Leader Hamza Shahbaz led the opposition, which of late has turned hostile towards the speaker for expelling their six members for hooliganism in the house. On Monday, they praised Speaker Pervaiz Elahi for listening to their concerns on the two deferred bills and for amending the rules to bring PML-N MPA Khawaja Salman Rafique (who is in the National Accountability Bureau’s custody in Paragon City scam) to the house.

Mr Elahi, however, asked Mr Shahbaz to also thank Chief Minister Usman Buzdar for these developments.

Mr Shahbaz said: “We are political workers and always appreciated the good work.” He said the rule of issuing production order for a detained MPA was functional in the other three provincial assemblies and now the Punjab Assembly also joined them. He requested the speaker to issue the production order of Mr Rafique.

Following the opposition’s serious concerns over the Punjab Domestic Workers Bill of 2018, the chair said there were chances of misuse of the bill if adopted without addressing certain matters.

“I suggest the treasury engage the opposition, experts and the general public before finalising the draft to be tabled in the assembly next Monday,” the speaker said.

PML-N’s MPAs Malik Ahmad, Khalil Tahir Sandhu, Azma Bokhari, Waris Kalu, Dr Mazhar Iqbal and Bilal Atta Tarar raised objections to the domestic workers bill, saying that everybody wanted the protection of the rights of the domestic workers but at the same time did not want exploitation of the new law to be used against employers.

Although Law Minister Basharat Raja argued that the bill addressed the objections of the opposition, the speaker insisted that the house should not adopt such law in a haste as it might spoil the reputation of someone if anything went wrong.

“We should welcome opposition’s suggestions as these will be fruitful for the new legislation,” the speaker said.

Former Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana Iqbal took strong exception to the comments of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Mian Aslam Iqbal that he (Rana Iqbal) would run the house on the instruction of his boss Shahbaz Sharif and never accommodated the opposition in the past. Malik Ahmad asked the chair to expunge Aslam Iqbal’s comments. Earlier, the speaker expunged Azma Bokhari’s remarks calling Imran Khan “selected prime minister”.

PPP Parliamentary Leader Hasan Murtaza staged walkout for not taking the opposition on board in the Punjab Right to Public Services Bill of 2018. PTI’s Chaudhry Zaheeruddin persuaded him to end the boycott and return to the House.

The reactive mission would specially visit the 15th century shrine of Jam Nizamuddin-II alias Jam Nindo (1443-1509) which had deve­l­o­p­ed wide cracks and is crumbling.

The visiting team of experts comprising Hayashi Nao and Jonathan Stanhope will prepare an exclusive report which is to be presented at Unesco’s next annual meeting, scheduled for June-July 2019 at Baku, Azerbaijan.

At last year’s meeting, held in Poland, followed by a recent meeting in Bahrain, Unesco had war­ned the government of Pakistan that if required steps were not taken towards conservation of the site as per international standards and the 15 recommendations were not followed, the Makli necropolis could be de-listed as an endangered World Heritage Site.

Besides the Jam Nindo tomb, the reactive team would inspect construction of the outer boundary wall of the necropolis and ascertain what measures had been taken to prevent unauthorised burials within the precinct of the heritage site.

A meeting of the archaeology department’s steering committee was held recently under the chairmanship of Manzoor Kanasro, the director general of antiquities and culture. Thatta Deputy Commis­sio­ner Usman Tanveer, consultant (archaeology) Qazi Ayaz, Makli necropolis conservator Sarfaraz Ahmed Jatoi, Nawaz Jatoi and Dr Mohammad Ali Manjhi, a historian and former director general of the culture department, attended the meeting.

It discussed threadbare various issues pertaining to the heritage site with reference to the Unesco reactive mission’s visit, tentatively scheduled for Jan 20-22.

The meeting decided to strictly implement the recommendations including stopping fresh burials in any part of the necropolis.

It noted that an alternative burial site had been earmarked for the local population.

Conservator Jatoi told Dawn that recently, structural engineers, architects and conservationists Mr Matthias from Germ­any and Mr Rand Eppich from Spain had visited the site and conducted geotechnical studies of the monumental shrine on behalf of Unesco with a view to protecting the heritage site. They have alre­ady submitted their reports to Unesco.

It also discussed measures for early completion of the necropolis’s outer boundary and beefed up security at the site.

Former director general of arch­a­e­ology Qasim Ali Qasim has, meanwhile, observed that Unesco was seriously concerned over the state of the Jam Nindo monument, which had been included in the master plan of the archaeology department.

He pointed out that when the position of the tomb’s columns was measured, it emerged that the 33-foot-tall structure with an equal size of plinth had tilted by seven inches which was quite alarming.

Dr Manjhi expressed his concern over Sindh and Balochistan having no representation on Une­sco’s annual convention tho­ugh Punjab and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa did have their representation.

The meeting expressed its satisfaction over the working of digital cracks monitors and weather stations present at the necropolis.

It was alleged that a Rangers’ team raided her house and took away her 17-year-old brother, Singhar, apparently for questioning over some matter relating to the ongoing campaign for what is being called “recovery of enforced disappearance victims”.

There has been no word so far from the Rangers’ personnel about the alleged raid.

Soon after the alleged raid, a number of civil society and nationalist activists held a protest demonstration at Shaheed Chowk in Khipro town of Sanghar district on Sunday.

The protesters described the alleged raid as an attempt to suppress the campaign and gag her voice. They demanded action against the personnel involved in the raid.

Similar demonstrations were held in Karachi and Hyderabad on Sunday and Monday.

MIRPURKHAS: A large number of activists belonging to the Sindh United Party (SUP), Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM) and its Arisar faction, Pakistan Peoples Party-Shaheed Bhutto (PPP-SB) and civil society organisations held a demonstration on Monday outside the local press club to condemn the alleged raid.

They claimed that Ms Lohar, her sister Sassui Lohar and mother were harassed by the raiding team.

Led by SUP activist Manzoor Ahmed Memon, the protesters raised slogans against the raid and demanded appropriate action for the recovery of all victims of enforced disappearance.

They also vowed to foil all attempts to suppress the campaign launched by the VMPS.

They noted with concern that the raiding team picked up Ms Lohar’s teenage brother and appealed to the Sindh Rangers director general to take notice of the action.

HYDERABAD: Civil society activists, including Mushtaq Mirani, Ali Palh advocate, Aslam Baloch, Zulfikar Halepoto, Punhal Sario and Suleman Abro, held a press conference here on Monday to condemn the raid.

They said that Sorath and Sassui were struggling for the recovery of their father. Punhal Sario said that it was their right to seek recovery of their father and other missing persons. He demanded that all such persons be produced before court.

Ali Palh advocate, who is also an activist of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, observed that those at the helm of affairs must know what was happening in the country and that’s why they were raising this issue. “As members of civil society, we cannot remain indifferent if someone goes missing,” he said.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: Local Gove­rn­ment Minister Saeed Ghani has said that the federal government’s “hasty” decision to put 172 persons named in the report of a joint investigation team (JIT) formed by the Supreme Court on the Exit Control List (ECL) suggested that it was actually a conspiracy to topple the Sindh government.

The minister said this while talking to the media after the session of the Sindh Assembly on Monday.

To a question, he said that the JIT had overstepped its authority by recommending in its report the names for their inclusion on the ECL. He said it was not his viewpoint, but it was the observation of the chief justice of Pakistan since the JIT was tasked to investigate the allegations and submit its report.

He asked whether the government had constituted any committee for including the names on the ECL or whether the Supreme Court had given orders to the federal government to do so.

In reply to another question, the LG minister said that objections were being raised on the capabilities and performance of the National Accountability Bureau ever since it was constituted.

He said during all previous governments, including the then Pakistan Peoples Party-led government, NAB had been politically victimising the PPP and even today it was being used by the government against his party.

Regarding Prime Minister Imran Khan and Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry’s upcoming visit to Sindh, Mr Ghani said that unfortunately Mr Khan was a “selected prime minister” who could visit Sindh by all means but Mr Chaudhry was not even recognised by his own party members so what could he say about him.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was informed during Question Hour on Monday that ostrich was not defined as a protected bird under the provincial wildlife laws and its farming was allowed under relevant laws.

Furnishing a statement on the floor, Forest and Wildlife Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said that a special permission for ostrich farming was required to be obtained from the provincial authorities as for poultry farming.

He said that a private farm had been established in Thatta for ostrich farming.

In reply to a question, he said that the Rs150.97 million project of rehabilitation and improvement of wildlife sanctuaries at the Haleji Lake, Langh Lake, Thatta and Qambar could not be completed owing to paucity of funds, and added that it would be completed in June.

He said that different jobs at the Haleji Lake, including liner plantation along the inspection path, development of floating mounts, development of a pelican island, restoration of historical information centres, development of the fun area for children, restoration and repair of lavatories, restoration of the crocodile enclosure, installation of a wireless system, and construction of floating rooms, had been carried out.

In reply to another question asked by opposition member Nusrat Sehar Abbasi, the minister said that a Rs50m project for habitat restoration and development of water harvesting facilities at the KNP, Karachi, and Jamshoro was expected to be completed by June 2019.

However, he added, the project’s date of completion had been extended by two years because of paucity of funds.

Answering a question by opposition member Arif Mustafa Jatoi, the minister said the Pai Forest in Shaheed Benazirabad had been declared a game reserve.

He said that hunting was not allowed in the Pai Forest, but the government was empowered to relax the rules and issue permits for hunting in special cases.

In reply to another question, Mr Shah furnished details of the year-wise allocation and utilisation of the budget for plantation and rehabilitation of forests during the past five years.

The minister said Rs612m was allocated in 2017-18.

Giving answer to a question, he said that the local fishermen were catching Indus blind dolphin as previously the Sindh fisheries department was issuing fishing permits for the catch.

He said that the population of the endangered species had remarkably increased since 2014 when the issuance of fishing licences by the SFD was finally stopped with efforts of the Sindh wildlife department.

The minister also told the house on a question by opposition member Arsalan Taj Hussain that 12 different species were declared endangered in the province. They were: Sindh ibex, Afghan urial, Indian wolf, honey badger, mugger, or marsh crocodile, gharial, or gavial, smooth-coated Indian otter, Indus blind dolphin, greater flamingo, freshwater turtles, hog deer (axis porcinus) and chinkara deer.

He said that several steps had been taken to conserve the endangered species. The steps, he said, included the establishment of a series of protected areas such as National Park, 34 wildlife sanctuaries and 13 game reserves for protection, conservation and management of endangered wildlife species.

Besides, the minister said, the Sindh Turtles and Tortoise Protection, Conservation and Compensation Rules 2014 had been enacted to ensure the conservation and protection of turtles in the province.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: Describing air pollution as the world’s single biggest environmental health risk, experts at a three-day international conference, which concluded at Karachi University (KU) on Sunday, called for collaborative research efforts to determine the impact of specific sources of air pollution on human health.

They were speaking at the fifth international conference on ‘Environmental horizon, sounding the alarm! Environment, climate change and health’ organised by KU’s department of chemistry and Office of Research Innovation and Commercialisation (ORIC), and International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS).

Sharing global concerns on air pollution, Dr Haider A. Khwaja from Wadsworth Centre at the School of Public Health of University at Albany in New York, said that air pollution was a serious public health issue the world over as population-based studies had documented health risks resulting from short-term exposure to air pollutants.

“The World Health Organisation reports that in 2012 around seven million people died — one in eight of total global deaths — due to exposure to air pollution. This data confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk,” he noted.

He said that the South Asian and Western Pacific regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012 with 2.6m deaths linked to outdoor air pollution and 3.3m deaths related to indoor pollution, according to WHO.

A significant number of these deaths, he said, occurred due to stroke and cardiopulmonary diseases. These findings were not based on a significant increase in pollution but rather on improved knowledge of the links between air pollutants and cardiopulmonary diseases.

Dr James J. Schauer, a senior civil and environmental engineer heading the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the association of atmospheric particulate matter particles with adverse health effects had been well established and led experts to develop standards on these pollutants and implement control measures.

According to him, different strategies can be used in air pollution control programmes to reduce the impact of particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, given the complex nature of the sources of these pollutants.

He emphasised the need for collaborative efforts between atmospheric science studies and epidemiological and toxicological studies to establish how specific sources of air pollution were affecting human health.

Sheryl H. Ehrman from Davidson College of Engineering, San Jose State University, USA, informed the audience that anthropogenic pollutants had been successfully reduced in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, resulting in improved air quality.

However, she said that parts of the mid-Atlantic were still non-attainment regions (areas which are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards as defined in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 of the United States).

The ozone, she pointed out, was a secondary air pollutant, formed by reactions between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Ozone precursors were mainly emitted by power plants, motor vehicles, industrial operations and biogenic sources.

“In the past several years, a new influx of emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing-based production of natural gas in the Marcellus Shale (the largest gas field in the US) may be counteracting the benefits that have been gained. On the flip side, low-cost natural gas could replace coal as fuel for power plants, potentially reducing emissions,” she observed.

Another speaker, Parisa A. Ariya of the department of chemistry and department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, shared that the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and WHO had identified airborne particles as a research priority of the utmost importance.

She said the IPCC pointed to the importance of aerosol-cloud processes due to their impacts on the absorption and scattering of irradiation, altering the earth’s climate whereas WHO predominantly considered aerosols to be health hazards.

Former federal minister for science and technology Atta-ur-Rahman spoke about how progress in science and technology had dramatically changed socio-economic conditions in different countries.

Director ICCBS Prof M. Iqbal Choudhary said biodiversity was a manifestation of chemical diversity and plants contained a fascinating array of highly evolved, specific and effective gene products.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court-mandated commission on water and sanitation in Sindh on Monday directed the local government secretary to hold a meeting with authorities concerned regarding public parks and submit a report about the feasibility of a scheme to convert sewage into grey water for gardening.

The commission, headed by retired Justice Amir Hani Muslim, gave one month to the LG secretary to file his report.

Justice Muslim visited the Fateh Park in North Nazimabad on Jan 12 on the request of the chairman of the district municipal corporation Central, where a registered society had introduced a scheme, Green Initiative, for converting sewage into grey water, which could be utilised for any purposes other than human consumption.

The commission said that not only the park in question, but other areas could also benefit through treated water.

DMC Central chairman Rehan Hashmi informed the commission that he introduced this scheme and was also planning to initiate it in different parks within the district.

The commission said that such schemes could make a huge difference if introduced in big parks and would also ease pressure on potable water as grey water can be utilised for gardening and maintenance of green patches.

It observed that the provincial government was required to examine the feasibility of converting sewage into grey water.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: Following a debate on extreme delays in awarding funds through a new National Finance Commission (NFC), the Sindh Assembly on Monday unanimously demanded that the federal government announce the NFC shares to the provinces in the next award.

Members of the Sindh Assembly, which met here with Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani in the chair, spoke for more than two hours in the debate allowed after the house admitted an adjournment motion moved by Pakistan Peoples Party’s Nida Khuhro last week.

As the debate ended, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Chawla tabled a motion calling the Sindh government to approach the federal government asking it to announce the NFC shares to the provinces.

The motion was unanimously passed. Members of opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan were present in the house but no lawmaker belonging to the Grand Democratic Alliance was present.

The members referred to Article 160 of the Constitution, according to which the president would notify the NFC award after every five years.

Lawmakers question Punjab’s biggest share

The current seventh NFC award gave 42.5 per cent of the divisible pool of taxes to the federal government. The remaining 57.5pc was distributed among the provinces — Punjab got 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc and Balochistan 9.09pc.

The members questioned the current multiple criteria under which Punjab took the largest share although it was Sindh that contributed up to 70pc to the total kitty.

A minister wants funds’ distribution on the basis of population factor decreased

They said population was still the dominant factor in awarding the NFC, which stood at 82pc. The share for backwardness, poverty and revenue collection was 5pc, 10.3pc and 2.7pc.

Education and Culture Minister Sardar Shah said it was time to reduce the share based on population to a significant level and other criteria should be given more share.

He said the NFC award was not just an issue for the Sindh government or the ruling PPP, but it involved the whole province for which all political parties in Sindh should get united and launch a struggle for the benefit of the people.

“No matter you belong to the PTI, MQM or any other party, we all belong to Sindh and we have to speak for the rights of Sindh,” he said.

He said out of a total area of 140,000 square kilometres of Sindh, just 34pc of it was irrigated by barrages and linked to canal systems; and two-thirds of Sindh equally deserved to be developed at par with the rest.

“To develop such remote vast swathes we need money, we need funds,” he said, adding that the reduction in the population criterion and increase in other factors would benefit Sindh and Balochistan.

He referred to the PTI leadership’s mantra of ‘Naya Pakistan’, saying a new Pakistan could only be possible by abiding by the Constitution.

Mover Nida Khuhro said the way the Centre was “victimising” Sindh for electing the PPP again, the NFC should now be called “No Funds Coming Award”.

She said like the previous government of Nawaz Sharif, the PTI government was not sincere in giving NFC award on time.

She said the federal government had not paid Rs90 billion to Sindh, which forced the provincial government to cut its development budget.

Ms Khuhro said instead of provinces, the federal government should award 3pc from its share to erstwhile Fata. “Such decisions are blatant violations of the Constitution. Neither the prime minister nor the cabinet can take such decisions without amending the Constitution.”

Opposition asks PPP to give a ‘just’ PFC award

All the opposition members supported the treasury member’s adjournment motion, yet they pressed on their demand that the funds coming to provinces should further be channelled to the third tier of government as well.

MQM-P’s Khwaja Izharul Hasan appreciated the fiscal policy teams of the PPP and the MQM, which succeeded in changing the NFC formula in recent years, which was earlier singularly based on the population criterion.

He, however, said Karachi was Sindh’s capital and its greatest revenue producer, yet the megacity was not receiving its due share from the provincial exchequer.

Khwaja Izhar said the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) in Sindh constituted by the government was not formed justly.

PTI’s parliamentary party leader Haleem Adil Shaikh blamed the provincial government for sending nomination for its member in the NFC after three months despite several reminders sent by Islamabad.

He said it was the Sindh government which should be blamed for a delayed constitution of the NFC.

He also demanded the PFC award claiming that the Sindh government had spent just 15pc of the development budget in the past six months while it allowed Rs391bn meant for development to lapse in the past nine years.

GDA’s Nusrat Abbasi also demanded the formation of the PFC award.

PPP’s Taimur Talpur said it was then president Asif Zardari who gave greater share to the provinces through a progressive NFC award.

GDA’s Arif Jatoi said former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had set up the NFC award based only on the population basis.

MQM-P’s Mohammad Hussain said Sindh had been a victim of the Centre’s “biased” attitude both in the NFC share and the PSDP.

He said all the lawmakers belonging to Sindh from parliament and the provincial assembly should register their protest in Islamabad jointly.

He added that the provincial government should ensure a just PFC award for every district of Sindh.

Jawaid Hanif, Ghanwar Isran, Omar Umari, Abdul Rasheed and Qasim Siraj also spoke.

The house passed The Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma Karachi Bill, 2018 unanimously. The bill was duly amended and recommended by the select committee.

An adjournment motion moved by PPP’s Sadia Jawed was admitted about the Karachi Circular Railway and a debate regarding the federal government’s promise was fixed for Thursday.

Five calling-attention notices by Haleem Shaikh, Riaz Haider, Marui Rashdi, Nusrat Abbasi and Mangla Sharma were responded to by the ministers concerned.

",2019-01-15,"ISLAMABAD: Leaders of some Balochistan-based political parties on Monday threatened to hold a protest during the expected visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Gwadar next month.

Independent MNA Moha­m­mad Aslam Bhootani from Gwadar and leader of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) Agha Hassan Baloch from Quetta criticised the federal government for “not taking elected representatives into confidence” regarding deve­l­opment activities being carried out in Balochistan, particularly in Gwadar.

Take a look: Balochistan cabinet shocked by CPEC presentation

“We will tell the Saudi prince that Balochistan is not for sale and that elected representatives of the port city have not been taken on board regarding the development activities,” Mr Bhootani, who sits on the treasury bench, said while speaking in the National Assembly.

“We will not allow any investment in Gwadar if we are bypassed,” he added.

According to media reports, the Saudi prince is expected to visit next month and would lay the foundation stone of a Saudi oil refinery in Gwadar.

Mr Bhootani said that elected MNAs and MPAs would also meet the Saudi ambassador in Pakistan and apprise him about their concerns.

He said earlier projects worth $62 billion were announced for Gwadar but the local representatives did not know where that money had been spent.

“Now we hear that Saudi Arabia is setting up an oil refinery in Gwadar but again the people of the port city have not been taken into confidence,” he regretted.

Mr Bhootani said not only him but elected representatives of the BNP-M were also not consulted regarding development projects in Balochistan.

National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser urged the MNA not to make a hue and cry as investment in Gwadar was a “sensitive” matter.

Agha Hassan Baloch of the BNP-M said that although his party was an ally of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in the centre, it was also kept in the dark regarding development activities in Baloch­istan and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.

“We are not against development activities in Balochistan, but the people of the province are disapp­ointed over being ignored,” he said.

“We did not get anything from the CPEC and now we are being bypassed again,” the BNP-M leader added.

ISLAMABAD: Terming the existing SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) targets unrealistic, a ruling party’s parliamentary secretary advocated binding all provinces to agree and deliver on improving basic health and human conditions in the light of local conditions.

Speaking to a group of journalists on Monday, Kanwal Shauzab, the parliamentary secretary of planning and development, said the 18th Constitution Amendment did not mean allowing the provinces to become ‘states within the state’ and they should be bound under Article 25 of the Constitution as to what they ought to do under the development agenda.

“Instead of being unanswerable to international agencies, the ADPs (annual development plans of the provinces) and PSDPs (public sector development programmes of the Centre) should be based on needs of the local people” to be responsive to basic human requirements, she said, adding that the funds should not be given to MNAs and MPAs to spend here and there on untargeted programmes without measuring outcomes.

She said the PTI government would have to change the definition of development budget from mega infrastructure like roads and building projects and shift the focus of spending directly on the people by addressing root causes of poverty and hunger.

Kanwal says 18th Amendment does not mean allowing provinces to become ‘states within the state’

Giving an example of just one hospital of Bahawalpur in south Punjab, Ms Shauzab said a total of 1,380,000 patients visited the outpatient department (OPD) and 85pc of them were referred to dialysis centre, which meant the quality of water and nutrition conditions of the country were to blame.

She said motorways passed through the area, but the people on both sides did not have the access road to reach the hospital or take their produce to the market.

In such conditions, she said, the people of the area were demanding hospitals and more dialysis machines. The need under the SDGs should be to address the water quality and ensure its supply to all to eradicate water-borne diseases rather than only building hospitals because by the time a hospital became operational the need for 10 more hospitals would arise.

She said the objective of the SDGs should not be to leave anybody behind and problems of poverty, hunger and nutrition should be addressed on a top priority basis. The imported agenda of SDGs would not resolve the issue of poverty and hence the SDG targets should be reframed in the light of local conditions.

Ms Shauzab said reprioritisation of development programmes should be done to achieve social sector goals, but there were interest groups everywhere that promoted foreign-sponsored agendas and projects.

She said the Voluntary National Review (VNR) for SDGs would be ready by June this year as work was under way in consultation with all stakeholders for achieving desired goals under the SDGs. But, she added, Pakistan had not yet worked out the exact financing requirement attached to achieve the SDGs and to achieve these goals without the commitment from the international community for financing seemed really too much ambitious.

She said the people of the country were missing from development priorities as infrastructure development was the top priority at a time when human development conditions were showing prevalence of an alarming situation.

Ms Shauzab said the Planning Commission was working on developing civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) for identification of 30 per cent gap in “our data to help achieve the SDGs by 2030”.

She said that CRVS was the compulsory, continuous, universal and permanent recording of all vital events such as birth and death. From these records, vital statistics on birth, death, cause of death, fertility and mortality (where migration data is also available) could be produced for policy and planning.

It could help in connecting data from birth registration to all important events of all individuals’ life for achieving the SDG targets and tracking all other requirements and obligations.

Ms Shauzab said that it was impossible to achieve the SDGs when acute poverty prevailed in several parts of the country, especially in south Punjab and interior of Sindh.

In reply to a question about the cost for achieving the SDGs, the parliamentary secretary said that work was under way along with stakeholders, but being a signatory to all goals on behalf of Pakistan, the federal government would have to re-prioritise the development requirements even after the enactment of the 18th Amendment.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: The world’s youngest Nobel Prize laureate and education activist Malala Yousafzai on Monday revealed that she had a photo of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in her room at Oxford University.

In a brief interview with the BBC, the 21-year-old activist spoke about what she does in between writing and university life.

“I think for relaxing it's just spending time with friends, playing cricket or just having a bit of gossip or just going for lunch,” she said. Malala, who is starting her second year at Oxford University studying philosophy, politics and economics, has often talked about her love for cricket. “When I say I love cricket, I’m not that good,” she quickly added.

Asked what the Nobel Prize winner did for fun, Ms Yousafzai expressed her liking for British comedy and sitcoms. “I recently watched the Blackadder. Sometimes I watch Yes, Minister and I also like the show Mind Your Language which I know wouldn’t be welcome the same way it was but I find it funny,” she said.

In terms of her university room and how she fares on keeping it clean, the global icon said her mother tells her off for being untidy. “I am not a big fan of posters, but I have a photo of Benazir Bhutto in my room,” she added.

Benazir Bhutto, who became Pakistan’s first female prime minister in 1988, had also attained an undergraduate degree from Oxford’s Lady Margaret Hall in the subjects of philosophy, economics and politics.

On Jan 8, Malala’s latest book We are Displaced: My Journey and Stories from Refugee Girls Around the World was released worldwide. In the latest title, Ms Yousafzai tells her own story and shares the journeys of other young female refugees who’ve been forced from their homes.

“We hear about refugees and immigrants but we never hear from them, especially from young women and girls,” she told the BBC explaining why she wrote the book.

Ms Yousafzai, who belongs to Swat, has been living in Birmingham, UK, since October 2012. Speaking about her own experience of settling in the country as an immigrant, she said: “In the beginning, it was very difficult. But, then I realised when you take a step forward and try to talk to people, it helps.”

He stressed that the existing criminal justice system urgently required reforms as a whole. Especially upgrade of the law for governance and management is required to ensure a neutral, responsive, accountable and transparent police force. The police force could only function efficiently when they were given administrative, operational and financial autonomy, he added.

CJP Nisar said that the Police Reforms Committee was established with the objective of an independent and impartial police force and its recommendations were very useful because they outline the duties of police officers, the separation of investigation procedures and composition of the Commission to promote transparency.

He stated that by implementing these recommendations, trust deficit between police and public would decrease and it would create a competent, efficient and responsive police force.

The CJP applauded efforts and contribution of members of the Police Reforms Committee, saying that they worked day and night to complete the report.

In his concluding remarks, CJP Nisar stressed the need for de-politicising the police to develop public confidence in the system. He stressed that there was a need to pinpoint lacunae in investigation resulting in the acquittal of criminals.

Report on police reforms

A steering committee headed by Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court and the designated chief justice of Pakistan, worked on the implementation of recommendations.

The convener of the Police Reforms Committee and former inspector general of Sindh Police, Afzal Ali Shigri, stated that performance of police was directly linked to the delivery of justice and performance of judiciary and criminal justice system.

He said in the past several efforts had been made to improve the performance of the criminal justice system. But, he added, the current initiative had the distinction that it was taken by the Supreme Court.

Mr Shigri said after formation of the Police Reforms Committee intensive deliberations and discussion were held within the committee. He said the report contained feasible and practical proposals on matters, like the redressal of grievances and improvement in the quality of investigation.

Mr Shigri also presented the report on police reforms to CJP Nisar.

The report recommends certain measures, such as establishment of “complaint redressal mechanism” at the office of the city police officer headed by an officer of additional inspector general rank in provinces and deputy inspector general in Islamabad.

It stresses the need of imparting best training to police officers, revamping urban policing and introducing forum for alternative dispute resolution (ADR).

",2019-01-14,"The police on Monday set free their four colleagues who were found to be “negligent” a day earlier when a man shot another man dead in their presence in Karachi's New Town locality.

Sohail Mughal, who had filed a petition in court for the recovery of his estranged wife and three daughters, had on Sunday allegedly gunned down 37-year-old Munawar Ali, with whom his wife and the children were living in flat in New Town. He had opened the fire in the presence of police personnel, who had escorted him to the victim's residence.

But police authorities said there was no legal cover to book the law enforcement personnel under criminal negligence charges as the new police act put in place a few years ago did not carry any such provision.

“We don’t have any penal section in PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) or Sindh Police Act wherein we could charge police officers for acts of criminal negligence,” revealed DIG East Amir Farooqi.

The senior officer pointed out that previously “we had section 155 in Police Order 2002 to place criminal liability in instances of criminal negligence by police officers”, but it was no longer applicable.

All detained police officers of Darakshan police who escorted the suspect on Sunday were thus released.

However, the DIG Farooqi said they have written to the DIG South to ""initiate departmental action against the delinquent police officers who brought accused Sohail Mughal in a police mobile bearing a gun"".

On Sunday, a police party had gone to the residence of Munawar Ali along with petitioner Sohail Mughal to arrest Ali on a court order to present Mughal's wife and his three daughters in court on the next hearing of the case.

However, before the police could arrest him, Mughal, who had hidden a 9mm pistol concealed in his shalwar, took out the gun and opened fire on Ali.

He fired four shots as a result of which Ali sustained two bullet wounds and was taken by the additional SHO Darakhshan to the Liaquat National Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Police arrested Mughal with the pistol and collected spent bullet casings from the crime scene.

On Monday, a case was registered against the suspect under Section 302 (murder) of the PPC on behalf of SHO New Town Mohammed Zubair.

The DIG East explained that the case was registered on behalf of the state as the victim’s family was insisting to nominate the police party which brought Mughal to the victim's residence.

An initial inquiry revealed that the officers could be guilty of ‘negligence’ but they had no involvement in Ali's murder.

The suspect in his initial statement before the police stated that he killed Ali as the deceased had allegedly ""misguided"" his family against him and also ""occupied"" his property.

According to DIG Farooqi, a daughter of the suspect is a doctor and the family had been separated ""legally"" from the father three years ago.

Police said it was still being probed as to what relation the deceased had with the family. The victim was involved in the construction business and also owned a car showroom.

",2019-01-14,"The Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination on Monday announced that Poliovirus was detected from the sewage of eight cities across the country during the environmental surveillance carried out by the polio eradication programme during last month.

According to the results shared by National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), the presence of poliovirus was confirmed in sewage samples collected from Karachi, Peshawar, Bannu, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Killa Abdullah, Pishin and Quetta during December 2018.

Under the supervision of the relevant provincial health departments, samples of sewage water are collected on a monthly basis from 58 sampling sites across Pakistan. They are tested by the regional reference laboratory for polio housed at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad.

As per the statement issued by the health ministry, in consideration of the associated risks, the country's polio programme has urged parents to ensure the immunisation of all children under the age of five in the upcoming polio campaign, which is scheduled to start from January 21.

National Coordinator Emergency Operation Centre for Polio Dr Rana Safdar said that while case counts were declining, as long as the virus was present anywhere in the country, the threat of the virus for vulnerable children remained.

""To finally eradicate the virus, vaccinating all children against all preventable diseases including polio is imperative both in routine as well as in special door to door campaigns,"" Dr Safdar added.

While acknowledging the progress that had already been made, the recently concluded Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio urged the programme to focus on children who missed the vaccination, for any reason and to ensure that the virus didn't survive any longer.

The group met on January 11-12 in Islamabad to assess the programme progress, opportunities and the remaining challenges towards achieving the goal of stopping transmission of the poliovirus.

",2019-01-14,"PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari on Monday said that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman should appear before the parliament in person, instead of lawmakers going to him to discuss the bureau's procedure for moving against opposition members accused of corruption.

Speaking during a National Assembly session, the former president said the time has come for the parliament to call the NAB chairman and ""proclaim a law"" that before any parliamentarian is summoned by NAB, their case should come to the house committee on law so it can decide whether there is actually a case against the said lawmaker or their family.

Editorial: Meaningful accountability

Zardari said he was hearing of plans among various parties to call on the NAB chairman, purportedly to discuss the bureau's anti-corruption drive that has ensnared several opposition members.

""Why will you go to the NAB chairman?"" he asked the MNAs present, before declaring: ""The NAB chairman should appear in person before the parliament.""

Zardari said the matter was not personal to him because he had encountered ""many NABs"" during his career and ""will continue to face them"".

""The real issue is, what will happen when you are summoned [by the accountability watchdog]?"" he said with a meaningful smile, addressing the treasury benches.

Zardari said his party was ""totally happy"" that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had today been given relief by the Supreme Court in the Avenfield corruption reference. He added that the PPP also ""does not want to see"" Nawaz's daughter, Maryam Nawaz, in the jail.

Speaking about his own troubles, he said it would be ""uncalled for"" and ""above the law"" if a new joint investigation team is formed comprising representatives of the ISI and other institutions, in the fake accounts case.

The PPP co-chairman said it was in the government's interest to ""tighten"" the NAB as doing so will reduce the prevailing ""insecurity"" among the bureaucracy and the country will start functioning to some extent.

Criticising the PTI government's performance of the first few months, he told the treasury members: ""We will not bring down your [government], you will fall yourselves.""

He said he wants to work to strengthen the parliament and democracy, and pointing towards government benches said, ""I also want to train these news friends that have come to the parliament.""

'No foreign force can prevent economic slide'

Zardari said the international financial support being given to Pakistan by friendly countries is welcome, but no ""foreign force"" can prevent the economic slide the country appeared to be heading towards because of PTI government's policies.

""Considering the financial situation at present [and] the way decisions are being taken arbitrarily... the country cannot be managed in this manner,"" the former president said.

He said no foreign power, be it China or any other country, could save Pakistan once it starts its journey towards becoming a ""failed state"" on the sliding scale ""because everyone will think of their own country"".

Zardari said during the PPP government's tenure, he had generated interest for investment in Pakistan through his 15 visits to China. It later materalised in the form of the agreement leading to the handover of the Gwadar port to China, he added.

Shahbaz questions Mohmand dam contract award

Earlier, Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif expressed concern over the government's move to award the contract for the Rs309 billion Mohmand dam to a Descon-led consortium on a single bid basis.

He said the manner in which the contract had been awarded had ""put question marks"" on the entire procedure. The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (Pepra) rules allow the award of contracts on a single-bid basis, but with certain conditionalities, he added.

""What was the urgency in awarding the contract?"" the PML-N president questioned. ""Why was rebidding not done?""

He said the bidding process for the project was initiated during the PML-N government, but it was the incumbent government that had awarded the contract. ""The responsibility of awarding the contract for the project lies with the PTI government,"" he added.

He said there was a ""direct conflict of interest"" in awarding the dam contract to the company allegedly owned by Abdul Razak Dawood, who is an adviser to the prime minister.

Shahbaz claimed that the PML-N government had eliminated loadshedding from the country by launching a number of projects on a war-footing basis

""If the country is facing loadshedding again then it is due to the negligence and incapability of the present PTI government.""

He said the current government was generating electricity through furnace oil which is the most expensive fuel and LNG-based power plants were presently not functioning to full capacity.

Opposition hatching conspiracy against dams: Vawda

As Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda stood up to respond to Shahbaz's criticism, the opposition refused to listen to him and staged a walkout.

Meanwhile, Speaker Asad Qaiser ordered a headcount after PPP lawmaker Shagufta Jumani pointed out the quorum. The opposition bid to disrupt proceedings by pointing out the quorum failed, however, with the speaker declaring the house in order after the headcount.

Vawda in his remarks criticised the opposition for staging a walkout after delivering speeches and presenting ""wrong facts before the house"".

Defending the government's award of the Mohmand dam contract to the Descon-led consortium, he said the project had been in files for 54 years and the PTI government had pulled it from there.

""The opposition is hatching a conspiracy against dams as they want to do politics on this issue,"" he alleged.

Vawda said the Mohmand dam will be completed under Imran Khan's government.

He said it was wrong to say that the contract had been awarded on a single-bid basis as five companies had submitted bids for the project after issuance of advertisements.

""The opposition leader has wrongly interpreted the Pepra rules,"" he claimed.

The minister said the government will not offer any NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance-like deal) to the opposition leaders.

",2019-01-14,"PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif on Monday spoke in military courts' favour and hinted that his party could consider supporting an extension, if approached by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led government.

Earlier this month, the law ministry informed a National Assembly standing committee that the summary for a second extension in military courts has been forwarded to the federal cabinet for approval.

In December, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had unequivocally said that his party would not support another extension to the military courts, whose current two-year term is set to expire in March.

While the PPP chairman, who had his reservations the last time as well, is unlikely to support the extension, his PML-N counterpart does not appear to oppose the idea.

""If the current government contacts us over the extension of military courts, we will think about it,"" Sharif told media representatives at Parliament House today.

The PML-N leader recalled that the military courts were formed during his sibling Nawaz Sharif's premiership, adding that ""terrorism was eradicated due to the establishment of the military courts, Zarb-i-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad"".

The leader of the opposition in the National Assembly credited the fear created from the military courts as a major factor in the war against terrorism.

Sharif's remarks are in line with those of his fellow PML-N leader Miftah Ismael, who recently said that his party will support the government in extension of tenure of military courts only if the PTI satisfies them in parliament on the issue.

“The military courts issue will be discussed in parliament. And if the government satisfied the PML-N lawmakers on the reasons behind extending term of the special courts, they will support the cause,” the former adviser on finance told the media on Sunday.

In March 2017, military courts were revived for the next two years after then president Mamnoon Hussain had ratified a NA bill on the matter.

The extension, however, had come after more than two months of deliberations and a tug of war between government and opposition parties over the technicalities of military courts' functioning.

",2019-01-14,"The Supreme Court on Monday expressed disappointment with the central and provincial governments over their failure to devise a mechanism for the conservation and purification of underground water and impose tax on its extraction, in line with a previous decision of the apex court.

A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nasir, was hearing a case pertaining to conservation, purification and taxation on extraction of underground water by bottled water companies.

Last week, the apex court had imposed a levy on companies selling mineral water and beverages at a rate of Re1 for every litre of surface water extracted by them. The revenue so collected will go to the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams fund. Authored by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, the judgement also required the provincial governments as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory administration to set up separate and distinct accounts to receive the amounts collected under the water charges. The amounts will then be deposited in the SC-created dams fund.

The judgement was issued on a suo motu case pertaining to selling by the companies of water extracted from underground sources without any charge as well as the quality and fitness of the same for human consumption.

The apex court had also constituted a special committee to devise a mechanism for calculation, collection and monitoring of the recovery of water charges from all major industries consuming surface or groundwater. The court had directed the federal and provincial governments to ensure installation of a foolproof and state-of-the-art metering mechanism at every extraction unit. The extraction will be monitored closely by the respective EPA on a daily basis, the verdict said.

On Monday, the chief justice remarked that water has become more ""precious than gold [but] if we passed remarks [over the situation] then headlines would state that [the judiciary] has raised questions on the credibility of the government"".

Dr Abdul Rahim, the secretary of the Law and Justice Commission — established for the systematic development and reform of laws — informed the top judge that neither its recommendations on the issue were heeded upon, nor an awareness campaign was launched.

The representative of the Punjab government, Owais Ahmed, informed the bench that the provincial government had approved 31 recommendations out of 38. He said that the government has formed a task force on water reservoirs, purification and taxation to deal with the issue.

Chief Justice Nisar reprimanded the representative, saying that the Supreme Court-mandated Water Commission did a lot of work, ""the government[s] are provided with everything but they don't want to do anything.""

""The Punjab government lacks both the will and the capability,"" the chief justice remarked.

""It seems that you people have decided to kill people of thirst [while] bureaucratic tapes appear in each and every matter. It seems that all the papers will be left in the record room of the court.""

""[We have] said time and again to take measures on a war-footing basis [to resolve the issue],"" he added.

The law and justice commission secretary pleaded the court to issue an order in this regard, to which Justice Nisar replied: ""The court will continue to issue orders but the government has become insensitive. People's lives are associated with water. If the government does nothing, it will be criminal negligence.""

Justice Ijazul Ahsan remarked that the price of water being used by sectors other than bottled water should also be fixed.

The bench observed that the Punjab government had devised a good plan as per the apex court's directions but only on paper. ""No political will is seen,"" Justice Ahsan remarked.

The apex court declared that the reply submitted by the Punjab government was an attempt to eyewash the judiciary and ordered the federal and provincial governments to submit a fresh response within 15 days.

Meanwhile, the commission's secretary said that the ICT administration also lacks a mechanism. He informed the court that the Capital Development Authority (CDA) charges a Rs100 water fee from each and every household, no matter how big or small it is.

The top judge expressed his displeasure over the situation and reprimanded the authority.

",2019-01-14,"IN December 2018, the Supreme Court of Pakistan passed an order that forced high-cost private schools to reduce any fees in excess of Rs5,000 by 20 per cent. The order itself was the outcome of a long and protracted battle, taken up by the court, on the insistence of protesting parents who stated that high-cost private schools were charging ‘extortionary’ fees, and subjecting them to arbitrary increases.

Last week, the court — specifically the outgoing chief justice — expressed his displeasure on hearing that high-cost private schools had started to cut back on extra- and co-curricular activities in the wake of its order. The court’s reaction appeared strange given that this was something everyone had predicted even before the price reduction was announced.

The issue of regulating fees in high-cost private schools is not a new one, and has produced considerable debate ever since the latest round of protests broke out around three years ago. Prior to the court’s intervention, it was also not an issue on which one could take a straightforward moral or policy decision. At its simplest, if high-cost private schools were subjecting their customers to exorbitant fee increases, (especially in tandem with one another as some have alleged), then as is the case with any private-sector enterprise some element of consumer protection and regulation is required.

What complicates it a bit (at least for some) is the moral dimension. Should education be treated like a car or a bar of soap? Does a normative component make schooling, especially in its societal function, appear as something distinctly sacred, and the act of wanton profiteering off it as somehow distinctly profane? To many, including myself, the idea of ‘selling’ education for profit appears abhorrent.

Should education be treated like a car or a bar of soap? To many, the idea of ‘selling’ education for profit appears abhorrent.

Education allows individuals to expand their capabilities and opportunities. Any version of a socially just society would not discriminate the attainment of these functions on the ability to pay.

At the same time though, one can recognise that the final responsibility for this distasteful situation lies largely with the state, which has both allowed for-profit activity in this sector, and encourages it to flourish by failing to carry out its own social welfare functions.

However, one must thank the court for inadvertently producing clarity on what has shown itself to be a difficult moral and policy conundrum otherwise. Whether one is theoretically in favour of regulating high-cost private schools or not, it is possible to agree that the way the court has done it may not be correct.

For starters, there is no actual principal at work here. The 20pc reduction does not fall in line with any broader framework of market regulation. In the absence of a detailed reasoning connected to financial forensics, we are left wondering about the basis of this particular number. Similarly, the Rs5,000 minimum at which it kicks in is also entirely arbitrary. Why are parents who send their kids to schools charging Rs4,999 being deprived of the court’s generosity?

Secondly, one does not need to be an economist to realise that price caps produce distortionary effects, and profit is usually the last thing compromised in such instances. Adding to the mess is the fact that school owners know that schooling as a product is relatively inelastic — it’s not easy to swap schools in the middle of a school year — so they can get away with reducing the quality of service provision. It may be the case that this is exactly what the intended message of an over-the-top-quality reduction is — a ploy to get the court to realise they do not agree with its decision. There are already reports circulating of class sizes being increased, teachers being laid off, and salaries being delayed. In the short to medium run those attending these schools will bear the cost of what was ironically intended to provide them with immediate relief.

Finally, as succinctly analysed by education researcher and academic, Minahil Asim, the court’s order carries no substantive redistributive function. Underpinning this point is the fact that the entire issue concerns a minuscule section of the population. As detailed in the short order, the brunt of the court’s attack is on large, high-cost private school chains like Lahore Grammar, City School, and Beaconhouse. Collectively, such schools cater to no more than a couple of per cent of the total school-going population.

The only reason why this is even an issue is because this couple of per cent lies at or near the top of the income distribution, and carries social and political heft, which is why its protests are heard by those in power. At the end of the day, the entire issue results in a short-term monetary transfer from privileged school owners to slightly less privileged upper-middle-class parents. And even that is offset by the reduction in quality schools are currently undertaking.

Without offering any sympathy for elite private school owners, and I certainly have none, one can see that as a policy instrument, arbitrary capping of profit for a small number of businesses is a strange moral crusade, especially when this has no positive spill-over for the rest of the population.

This is not to say there are no smart ways of regulating elite private schools — India and a host of other countries have instituted actual redistributive quotas for the underprivileged in such schools in order to expand quality educational opportunities. Similarly, from a consumer protection point of view, if there is collusion and cartelisation between elite school chains, the Competition Commission must be empowered to investigate and then, if needed, levy a punishment. The larger point here is that the issue needs to be approached holistically, with education, redistribution, and consumer protection forming key pillars of regulation. What is quite clear so far is that the current attempt has none of these as its basis.

",2019-01-14,"THE policy of keeping the rupee-dollar exchange rate fixed over extended periods of time, despite manifest signs of currency overvaluation, has not served Pakistan well. The parity was held around 60 during the Musharraf era, and around 100 in the recent Dar era. In both cases, unsustainable external deficits emerged, culminating in balance-of-payments crises requiring large shock devaluations and foreign bailouts to fix.

These intermittent currency crises are a major impediment to Pakistan’s long-term prosperity. They incentivise businesses to focus on short-term returns rather than long-term investments to boost the country’s economic potential. They deter foreign direct investors demanding macroeconomic stability and policy continuity as prerequisites. And, they weaken Pakistan’s geopolitical standing and sovereignty (bailouts are never a free lunch).

Yet, despite these nontrivial costs, we hardly see any ‘real-time’ opposition to this fixed rupee-dollar policy while it is in full implementation. One cannot recall any commentators (other than IFIs) clamouring for timely adjustment of the rupee during the Musharraf and Dar eras. And if this government decided to stabilise the exchange rate at 150 for the next three years, one expects few to object. Why? Because, unfortunately, the political economy is supportive of such a policy.

Pakistan’s opinion-makers are major beneficiaries of an artificially low rupee-dollar rate.

Pakistan’s opinion-makers are major beneficiaries of an artificially low rupee-dollar rate: it subsidises their spending on luxury imports (such as SUVs), children’s education abroad, and vacation travel. The masses don’t protest, as the more affordable import prices and lower inflation associated with an overvalued currency imply a quality of life improvement of sorts, albeit short-lived. Financing of the resulting higher imports/external deficits is also easier under a fixed parity as global banks generally lend in dollars.

One can ask why exporters do not protest the overvaluation policy. They probably do, but after years of import bias, the export lobby has weakened, and is overtaken in foreign exchange terms by overseas Pakistanis, whose remittances are largely insensitive to exchange rate movements.

The only way to break this unholy bias in favour of a low/fixed rupee-dollar parity is by raising awareness about its economic flaws and costs; and articulating an alternative currency regime to serve a volatile emerging market well. To this end, let’s examine why a fixed rupee-dollar parity makes little economic sense for Pakistan.

The correct measure of a country’s external competitiveness is its real, not nominal, exchange rate; the more appreciated the real exchange rate, the lower the country’s competitiveness, ceteris paribus. A percentage change in Pakistan’s real exchange rate equals the sum of: (i) the percentage change in the nominal exchange rate (where a more depreciated nominal exchange rate raises competitiveness); and (ii) the inflation rate differential between Pakistan and its trading partners (where a positive differential reduces competitiveness).

Assuming the US was Pakistan’s only trading partner, a stable rupee-dollar parity would guard against a loss in Pakistan’s competitiveness only if the inflation rates for Pakistan and the US are aligned. This is far from true: between mid-2013 (when the last IMF programme began) and end-2017, cumulative inflation amounted to 21 per cent in Pakistan vs 6pc in the US, implying a rupee overvaluation of 15pc vs the dollar alone.

But Pakistan did trade not only with the US; 92pc of our recent trade was with other economies, led by China (20pc), the Euro Area (12pc), UAE (11pc). Unfortunately, inflation (21pc) was also higher than these other trading partners’ inflation (8pc), exacerbating the rupee’s overvaluation. Moreover, the currencies of these other trading partners depreciated on average by 9pc against a rising dollar, so with the rupee tied to the dollar, there was also a nominal rupee appreciation vis-à-vis these economies. The combined effect was a 22pc real effective (ie trade weighted) appreciation of the rupee between mid-2013 and end-2017. (A table and a chart, on Pakistan’s trade share with its major trading partners, and real effective exchange rate path, are included in Dawn’s web version of this article.)

The foregoing provides a measure of the massive external imbalance that had accumulated under the last government, and which had to be fixed. The rupee’s nominal depreciation in 2018 of 33pc should deliver a good part of the needed real depreciation, though probably not all of it. Pakistan’s non-US trading partners’ and other competitors’ currencies have also depreciated against the US dollar in 2018 (by 5pc and 18pc respectively, in median terms). Thus, the net improvement in Pakistan’s competitiveness due to the 2018 nominal devaluation of 33pc is likely to have been less than the around 22pc required to remove the overvaluation. (A table on the nominal currency depreciation of several of Pakistan’s competitors has been included in the web version of this article.)

If a stable rupee-dollar framework is not appropriate for Pakistan, what is? We can get a clue from Pakistan’s competitors. Most allowed their exchange rates vis-à-vis the US dollar to adjust early in the 2013-17 period (median depreciation was 13pc). This timely adjustment helped them avoid the cliff drop of 33pc the rupee suffered in 2018.

There’s no reason why a similar, more flexible exchange rate regime, anchored in a basket of trading partner currencies (rather than a single currency), should not work well. However, a more flexible regime will bring its own imperatives. With a more volatile currency, the private sector will need access to better instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk. The government would be well advised to develop futures and forward options that financial institutions and traders can access at reasonable cost.

Finally, a credibly independent State Bank, and clear communication are needed to regain the severely dented market confidence. If markets do not believe in the announced exchange rate policy, it is not worth the paper it is written on. Markets can bet (and win) against a currency even when the latter is in line with fundamentals. And the experience of the UK’s Black Wednesday (Sept 16, 1992) has shown that no sovereign, however powerful, can survive the market’s onslaught.

",2019-01-14,"The Supreme Court on Monday upheld an Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict that had ordered the suspension of prison sentences awarded to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in the Avenfield corruption reference.

A five-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, dismissed National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) plea against the high court's decision.

The apex court, in its ruling, said that NAB has failed to provide the ""ground for cancellation of bail"" and that the IHC had not exceeded its authority in granting bail to the convicts of the Avenfield reference.

Read: Avenfield House or ‘tax haven’ house?

The Supreme Court's decision brings a rare relief for the Sharif family, both of whose leaders — Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif — are currently incarcerated.

Maryam thanked ""Allah Almighty for today's decision"" but said that her ""true relief and happiness would be when my father comes back home.""

At the outset of the hearing today, the chief justice told NAB prosecutor Akram Qureshi to ""convince [the bench] why the high court's ruling should be suspended"".

The chief justice told the NAB counsel to delineate the grounds on which the apex court can suspend the granting of bail. ""Also tell us if the high court had the authority to suspend the sentence,"" he added.

Qureshi explained that his argument stood on the basis of earlier cases heard by the top court, claiming that bail can only be granted in the case of ""hardship"", which was not the reason behind IHC's verdict.

The NAB prosecutor pointed out that the IHC had questioned the merit of the trial in its judgement — something he said a high court cannot do in a bail plea.

Take a look: IHC surprised at ‘lapse’ by NAB in Avenfield case

""Nawaz Sharif was granted bail on the same grounds that had led to his conviction,"" observed Justice Gulzar Ahmed, who was also part of the bench. ""You did not challenge those grounds.""

Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, who is set to succeed Justice Nisar as the top judge, said that NAB's argument was not ""solid"" and rejected the claim that the high court had exceeded its authority.

He further said that the high court had mentioned that its ""observation was not final"".

The chief justice, however, told the NAB prosecutor that ""an interim order is never final and [it] never affects the final verdict either.""

In July 2018, an accountability court had handed Sharif 10 years as jail time for owning assets beyond known income and 1 year for not cooperating with NAB.

His daughter Maryam was given seven years for abetment after she was found ""instrumental in concealment of the properties of her father"" and one year for non-cooperation with the bureau. Meanwhile, Nawaz's son-in-law retired Captain Safdar has been given one year jail time — for not cooperating with NAB, and aiding and abeting Nawaz and Maryam.

",2019-01-14,"A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court Lahore registry on Monday while hearing an appeal for the suspension of the death sentence of mentally-ill prisoner Khizar Hayat forwarded the matter to a larger bench for hearing and adjourned the case for an indefinite period.

Hayat, a former police constable, was convicted in October 2001 for killing a fellow policeman. He was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003. He has spent nearly 15 years on death row. Hayat was first diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic in 2008 by jail medical authorities.

In 2010, the jail medical officer recommended that Hayat needed specialised treatment and should be shifted to the psychiatric facility. However, this was never done. In 2017, the Lahore High Court (LHC) had stayed the execution of Hayat, but rejected his mother's appeal for a stay in December 2018.

Last week, a district and sessions court in Lahore fixed Hayat's execution for Jan 15.

On Saturday, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had taken notice of the issuing of a death warrant for Hayat and sought a report to ascertain his ailment, suspending his sentence until further orders. He had also directed the law officer to verify whether the condemned prisoner was mentally ill.

A two-member bench comprising Justices Manzoor Ahmad Malik and Sardar Tariq Masood heard the appeal for suspension of Hayat's death sentence filed by his mother Iqbal Bano. Jail officials and a mental health specialist were in court today, along with Hayat's lawyer.

The lawyer contended before the bench that the Supreme Court had halted executions in similar cases in the past.

""But why wasn't the state of his mental health raised earlier during the trial?"" Justice Manzoor Ahmad Malik asked. ""Why, when he is set to be punished, is the point being raised?""

The lawyer responded that Hayat had been diagnosed with schizophrenia during the trial, adding that a six-member medical board had been set up in 2016 to examine his mental health and confirmed that he had a mental illness.

According to Section 444 of the jail rules, a person with a mental illness cannot be executed, the lawyer argued.

""Do you believe that Hayat's mental state is not right?"" Justice Malik asked the doctor in court.

""Khizar Hayat is suffering from a mental illness,"" replied Dr Mubashir, adding that a medical board could be set up to examine his mental state.

""In this state, the subject does not know what he is doing,"" the doctor added.

The jail official apprised the court that Hayat was being held at the hospital at Kot Lakhpat jail.

Justice Malik noted that Hayat's medical report is not completely clear. He appeared wary that other convicts would start appealing against their convictions using mental illness as a pretext.

""We're sending the matter to a larger bench,"" he added.

The court subsequently ordered that the appeal against Hayat's execution be forwarded to a larger bench, and adjourned the case indefinitely.

Mother challenges death sentence

Khizar Hayat's mother, Iqbal Bano, in her appealing challenging her son's death sentence, had requested the chief justice to visit the Kot Lakhpat jail ward for mentally ill prisoners and investigate what medicines were being given to her son.

She pleaded that his medical records be investigated ""to determine why his treatment was not being done properly and why his condition was worsening day by day"".

The appeal also challenged the LHC division bench's 2018 judgement, and sought a stay on Hayat's execution. It said the judgement passed by the division bench was not in accordance with law and the prison rules. It said the bench mixed the conviction with execution and thereby dismissed the petition on wrong premises.

It stated that the bench had not appreciated the extensive medical history of the appellant’s son as well as the reports of the medical boards establishing the mental ailment of Hayat.

The appeal argued that a condemned prisoner could not be executed in utter disregard of the prison rules on the subject. It pleaded that the government had a legal duty under the Prisons Rules 1978 to provide the appellant’s son with adequate and appropriate treatment for his mental illness at a psychiatric facility. To deny him this treatment was an arbitrary abuse of power and a violation of Articles 9, 14 and 25 of the Constitution, it contested.",dawn,Dawn,Judiciary,"Khizar Hayat, Supreme Court, death sentence, Saqib Nisar",1

",2019-01-14,"A JIT CULTURE that appears to have developed in the country — institutions and political parties seeking ad hoc, intelligence agencies-driven Joint Investigation Teams to probe all manner of public malfeasance and corruption — has been carried to a mirthful new level.

Criticising the electricity and gas shortages in the country, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Saturday demanded the formation of a JIT to probe who is responsible for the ongoing energy crisis. Perhaps Mr Abbasi was speaking in a lighter vein, but other political leaders do not appear to share Mr Abbasi’s humour.

Also read: JIT deletion

Revelations last week that a sister of Prime Minister Imran Khan has more previously undisclosed properties abroad resulted in some opposition leaders immediately demanding that a JIT be formed and Mr Khan’s sister be placed on the ECL. It appears that the leading opposition parties, the PML-N and the PPP, believe that since their leaders have been subjected to unfair JIT processes, the PTI must suffer similarly.

The opposition is wrong. The emergence of JITs is a trend that ought to discouraged, not encouraged. While in certain cases a JIT may be merited, its extensive and unrestrained use undermines normal institutional processes.

Moreover, the intelligence component which gives JITs a perceived weight in certain quarters acts to further muddy institutional waters, renders murky the separation of powers and adds to a perception of civil-military tensions in the country. As the Supreme Court itself has reiterated in recent days in the wake of the controversy over the JIT report on the so-called fake banks account case, a JIT report is not a conclusive finding of fact.

At most, a JIT report can be a starting point for the investigation and prosecution aides of the legal process. And it is in those areas — investigation and prosecution — that the state should concentrate its reform efforts. An effective accountability process is one whose foundations are strong institutions as opposed to ad hoc attempted solutions.

At a time when parliament may take up the issue of again extending the life of military courts for civilians accused of terrorism by the state, would it not further the democratic project by debating and implementing meaningful investigation, prosecution and judicial reforms?

At the moment, the politicisation of JITs virtually ensures that their findings and recommendations are immediately denounced as partisan. The politicisation also helps the political class avoid providing adequate explanations in the court of public opinion — politicians have spent more time attacking the formation and composition of JITs than answering the allegations set out in JIT reports.

If accountability is to be fair, transparent and across the board the process of accountability must be through a stronger institutional framework. Surely if the PTI, PML-N or PPP proposes a strong but transparent accountability process, the other parties will need to seriously consider them.

Instead of demanding JITs for all manner of issues, the political class should debate institutional reforms.

The FBR audit member further said that Rs340 million have so far been recovered, while the recovery of another Rs768m is expected.

",2019-01-14,"AS the current chief justice’s tenure comes to a close, the news of extrajudicial actions taken in that time has far exceeded the news of the many regular judicial decisions taken therein. This last occurred during the tenure of Iftikhar Chaudhry as chief justice.

Many articles have been written by lawyers arguing the merits and demerits of the actions of both chiefs. Proponents of this method of ‘judicial governance’ argue that overreach is necessary where the executive is so deeply flawed.

Critics argue that there is no difference between overreach by the judiciary and overreach by similarly unelected forces.

Proponents of the Chaudhry regime who forgave its flaws only because its aims were anti-establishment find themselves in the other camp when faced with the ‘established and united’ might of the dam-funding Justice Nisar.

Critics argue this is the natural fallout of accepting the populist suo motu-ism on bottles of wine as propagated by Chaudhry.

However, the most critical similarity is perhaps the evolution of the personal ethos of both men and how it underwent such a tremendous and perhaps mysterious change in an age where the minds of normal, lesser men are set and rigid.

Why would a judge suddenly go against his own ethos?

Some brilliant arguments were made after the reversal of the houbara bustard hunting ban judgement. The about-face came immediately post the short Jawwad Khwaja tenure as chief justice. It was argued that such a frequent change of mind dilutes the power of the judiciary as a whole and exhibits a political change of heart rather than a change of the judicial mind.

Take a look: Chief justice cautions politicians against 'undermining judiciary'

Justice Nisar was one of four judges out of the 17-member bench of the Supreme Court who dissented against any idea of a ‘basic structure’ or salient features in our Constitution. In what orthodox legal minds would consider his finest hour, a full-throated critique from Justice Nisar of such a restriction, upon what he viewed to be the absolute right of the people, included the following: “If we were to introduce such a doctrine into Pakistan would not critics be entitled to speculate whether the nation has changed a military autocracy for a judicial autocracy, with but a brief interval for an improperly functioning democracy.”

When critiquing the power the Indian supreme court now enjoyed over parliament, Justice Nisar wrote: “This is of course a completely unprecedented display of ‘judicial’ power — power in its most naked form. Not merely unchecked, but uncheckable, since there are no means of checking it known to the laws of any civilised system of jurisprudence. This is a malady for which there is no remedy and an ailment for which there is no cure short of a complete uprooting of the judicial and democratic system. A power so vast, so all embracing, can hardly be conceived by any democratic system of governance resting on the basic principle of checks and balances.”

What then is the process by which a senior judge after assuming the ultimate seat of his office begins to rewrite theories he has personally expressed and endorsed throughout his tenure? For Chaudhry, servility had got him as far as the Supreme Court and it was going to take him no further. It was time to bare teeth to who had until then been the master, and an undercurrent of resentment already existed to help those teeth sink in deeper than they otherwise would have. A seven-year tenure as chief ahead of him, extraordinary because of the nature of his own appointment, convinced his activism and steeled it.

But what of Justice Nisar — rose through the merit of his acumen rather than his politics, authored fundamental judgements which limited the authoritarian functioning of federal government through the prime minister and his bureaucracy. He opined strictly against judicial overreach.

What makes such a man suddenly demand money for a personal pride project that he admittedly has no expertise about? What is the difference between endorsing a large dam without adequate research into its viability or feasibility, and endorsing Agha Waqar’s water kit?

Why would a judge who has personally espoused judicial restraint, written it into the body of the most famous judgements he was part of; suddenly go against his own ethos?

What made him suddenly become a jurist who threatened parties with the demolition of their premises or other criminal sanction unless they deposited money into ‘his’ dam fund? What made him the weekend warrior who held conferences on population control? What personal need for publicity or expression could suddenly arise in a man whose office was already his, and limited to a term predefined? What made or compelled this brilliant and conservative adjudicator to suddenly become this populist and activist force?

The answer to these questions may be singular; and will most certainly determine his legacy.

",2019-01-14,"China and Pakistan have made strides — particularly in electricity and infrastructure projects — in the first three-year phase of their cooperation under the multi-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Both countries have had good and not-so-good experiences and are learning about each other’s strengths and deficiencies as they try to build upon lessons learnt.

At the conclusion of the recently held eighth meeting of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC), they agreed to conduct at least five in-depth sector studies for future investment cooperation under the framework as Islamabad pursues more financial support and Beijing seeks increased facilitation, improved security and a smooth repayment mechanism. In addition, “both sides agreed to make joint efforts to improve the overall media environment for CPEC cooperation”.

Pakistan made a formal request to the JCC — the highest decision-making body on the CPEC — for “more grant, investment, joint ventures and concessional loan arrangements to strengthen and fast track” transport infrastructure, industrial cooperation and socio-economic development.

Beijing is annoyed at the Sindh government for slow progress on Karachi Circular Railway, which it considers critical for the city’s prosperity

China’s focus during the meeting that ended on Dec 20 was more on putting in place a mechanism that ensures smooth repayments given Pakistan’s financial constraints. It expects Islamabad to further strengthen the security structure and take targeted measures to reduce the threat of terrorism by speeding up the building and deployment of Special Security Division-South. Beijing is also pushing more vigorously for the removal of irritants in the implementation of existing projects.

Led jointly by Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, and Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar, minister for planning, development reforms, meeting participants appreciated that the CPEC had achieved important milestones of early-harvest projects (EHP) and was now entering a new development stage.

The in-depth studies will be on Pakistan’s power market, a cascade study for hydropower projects all along the Jhelum River, optimisation of overall energy mix, an oil and gas industry development plan and a five-year action plan for cooperation on the highway between China and Pakistan as part of the joint traffic density study.

“(The) results of a joint study on power market of Pakistan will be fundamental for deciding the next step of energy cooperation.” The working on the study has just begun. Pakistan has committed to putting into operation all transmission lines required for the evacuation of energy well before CPEC projects achieve commercial operations to avoid penalties.

The payment of outstanding tariffs for the operational energy projects is a source of irritation for China. The two sides agreed to have scientific planning and amicable negotiations to address the issues arising from energy cooperation and create a common panel under the joint working group on energy for monthly formal and informal communications and consultations.

Pakistan promised a timely recovery of bills from consumers as part of the ongoing campaign to reduce line losses and improve collection through reforms and new technology. But Pakistan also wanted Chinese technical support with respect to technology. A comprehensive technical study will also be carried out to increase the production capacity of the surface mine in the Thar coalfield.

Pakistan has demanded that a major 1,320-megawatt Rahimyar Khan project under CPEC be scrapped on the ground that its next-stage priority was using domestic sources of energy. Hence, the need for maximum benefits from the Jhelum River flows by optimising the combined operation of all cascade projects there.

On the industrial side, China asked Pakistan that the Board of Investment should act as lead agency for industrial development and ensure land, energy, taxation, customs, law and other services from the relevant departments to deal with land prices, park development models and infrastructure services.

Rashakai in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dhabeji in Thatta and M3 in Faisalabad have been selected as special industrial zones for the first phase of development. They will promote Chinese investments in key industries, like textile, petro-chemical and iron and steel.

In infrastructure, both sides are happy with the progress on two big projects: $8.2 billion Mainline (ML-1) from Karachi to Khyber and $2bn Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) besides Eastbay Expressway Gwadar and security arrangements for them. Pakistan has promised to ensure timely land acquisition and demolition for the project implementation.

The preliminary design of ML-1 will be ready this month. The project will be implemented in line with the framework agreement signed in May 2017. This means China will provide up to 85 per cent of the project cost as a loan as opposed to a “build-operate-transfer” model proposed by the PTI government to shift financial responsibility on to the private sector and keep government loans on the lower side.

Beijing is annoyed about slow progress on KCR by the provincial government despite the project being critical and feasible for the growth and prosperity of the country’s largest city. Mass transit projects for Quetta and Peshawar have been put on the back burner for the time being because of a lack of preparedness. These will be taken up once their PC-1s are approved by the relevant government forums.

Noting full operational capability of the Gwadar Port, the two sides agreed to continuously pay high attention to it. Weekly container liner services are calling the port as coal trans-shipment and clinker export take place. The JCC appreciated progress on the Gwadar Free Zone. It agreed to jointly make more efforts to attract qualified companies to invest in the area.

Pakistan was required to provide agreed tax and tariff mechanisms to create a good investment environment leading to the next phase. The two sides have failed so far to finalise the Gwadar Smart City Master Plan, but promised to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the New Gwadar International Port before March 2019.

The celebrations in connection with the birth anniversary had commenced on Friday and concluded in Gurdwara Bhai Joga Singh at Mohallah Jogan Shah Qissa Khwani, Peshawar, on Sunday.

According to a statement, the three-day event was organised by the Auqaf, Religious and Minority Affairs Department, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to show harmony and celebrate inclusiveness.

Auqaf secretary says budget allocated for religious festivals of minorities

On the first day, a procession was held which was marked by rendering of hymns by Sikh community, including men and women. Over 5,000 Sikh devotees from across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took part in the procession and then other rituals followed by Langar (feast).

Adequate measures were put in place by the police department to ensure full security for smooth celebration of the event.

The chief guests included MPAs Ravi Kumar and Wazirzada and Sikh community leader Ranjeet Singh besides some government officials. The major attraction of the procession was the display of ‘Gatka,’ a famous Sikh martial art and other sword exercises.

On this occasion, MPA Ravi Kumar paid tribute to the slain Soran Singh and said that his services as adviser to the chief minister and his personal efforts for the communities would always be remembered.

He also said that such events would build understanding of traditions and beliefs of minorities and people here had shown a sign of interfaith harmony. In response to the demand of Sikh community, he said that Shamshan Ghat would soon be set up.

In this regard, MPA Wazirzada said that celebration of minorities’ events would help spread love and peace. He maintained that the minorities were allowed to practice their religion freely. Auqaf department secretary Hidayat Jan stated that they had allocated budget for religious festivals of minorities of KP. Guru Gobind Singh was the 10th Sikh Guru, a spiritual master and philosopher.

",2019-01-14,"PESHAWAR: The World Health Organisation, which is providing technical assistance to the authorities to streamline healthcare financing in all provinces and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, will help them to put in place a uniform programme of free healthcare across the country.

A mission of WHO including Prof Soonman, Dr Faraz Khalid and Dr Mohammad Saeed Akbar Khan held discussions with the officials of health and finance departments during a visit to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recently.

The mission, which reached Pakistan on January 8, 2019 on the government’s invitation to streamline its healthcare financing system, also visited other provinces and later presented its recommendations to Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (NHSRC) regarding improvement in the system.

The health department officials told Dawn that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had launched Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP) two years ago that benefitted about 150,000 patients. Under it, each household of eight persons is entitled to get services up to Rs540,000 but still there is room for improvement.

The government pays premium to the insurance company, but the latter retains 20 per cent of the unspent amount at the end of the year and returns 80 per cent to the former. The health department wants that entire amount should be spent on patients’ health and profit margin by the company should be reduced.

As the government has designated about 100 private and state-run hospitals to treat people under the SSP, but bulk of the amount goes to the private sector because of prompt services being provided to the patients there.

In the government hospitals, the doctors and other staff involved in the treatment of SSP’s patients don’t get any additional benefits due to which they are least interested in their treatment, according to sources.

“The WHO has been providing technical assistance to the government to offer quality healthcare services to families living below the poverty line through free of cost health insurance programmes and is devising strategy to bring uniformity among the programmes run by federal government and province, especially SSP in KP,” said officials.

They said that those initiatives were steps towards realisation of the WHO’s Universal Health Coverage, which needed to be ensured in the face of hefty rise in public sector expenditure as well as high cost of medicines. Not only these programmes ensure that the under-privileged citizens across the country get access to quality medical services in a swift and dignified manner, but it also ascertains, by preventing the catastrophic expenditures on health, that poor families do not slip further down the poverty line.

The world health agency has conducted a ‘health financing diagnostic review’ of social health protection initiatives to plan for further public sector funding and sustainability of these initiatives, specifically undertaking an in-depth diagnostic analysis of the health financing system in the country by taking into consideration the developed political arrangement and identifying the challenges including raising, managing and using financial health resources.

According to officials, the WHO’s visit was aimed at generating a policy dialogue to promote more public money for health by undertaking a fiscal space analysis for the health sector and identifying alternative relevant resource mobilisation arrangements.

Pakistan has sought WHO’s technical cooperation to develop a federal health financing policy that could be used in the formulation of provincial health financing strategies. The UN health agency will also extend cooperation to the government in designing and implementing the health insurance programme in the provinces to enhance financial protection goal for the poor.

",2019-01-14,"PESHAWAR: The austerity drive of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is likely to sweep away wildlife department as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa environment department has moved a summary to merge it with the forest department.

Minister for Environment Syed Mohammad Ishtiaq said that summary regarding merger of the two departments was forwarded to chief minister and chief secretary on Friday last. The cabinet will approve the summary. He said that merger of Forest Development Corporation with forest department was also on the cards to avoid overlapping and streamline the affairs.

“The purpose of merger of the two departments is to save resources and share responsibilities among employees to protect forests as well as wildlife,” the minister told Dawn.

Proposal shocks wildlife conservators

The wildlife department was set up in 1995. Before, it was functioning under the umbrella of forest department in the name of ‘game wing’. The government will amend the relevant laws for merger of the two departments.

The environment department’s proposal shocked wildlife conservators, who termed the move “very damaging” for the management of wildlife in the province.

“This decision will affect wildlife management,”’ said Dr Mumtaz Malik, former chief conservator and founder of the department. He added that wildlife would go back to zero after merger of the two departments.

“A department, which got national and international recognitions and introduced activities like trophy hunting of wild species, established national parks, wildlife parks and conservancies, is being abolished in the name of merger,” he said.

An expert associated with an international conservation body said that wildlife would lose its identity and specialised staff if an established department was abolished. “The government should not wind up an established department,” he said, adding that those two disciplines were separated in 1970s.

More than 1,000 employees of the wildlife department would be put at the disposal of forest department. In addition, the post of chief conservator of wildlife department would stand abolished after the merger.

The department is currently managing seven national parks including Lulusar-Dudipatsar, Chitral Gol, Broghil Valley, Ayubia, Saiful Muluk and Sheikh Badin. Setting up of national parks not only improved natural habitats but also moved some rare species like snow leopard and markhor from the endangered to vulnerable categories with the support of local communities.

If cabinet approves the merger, chief conservator forests will look after both flora and fauna in the province including thousands of hectors of national parks, wildlife parks, conservancies, game reserves and wetlands etc. The post of chief conservator of wildlife will also be dissolved, according to the summary.

The previous government of PTI had made a comprehensive law called Wildlife and Biodiversity (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Act, 2015. Forest and wildlife operate under the umbrella of environment department. The previous government had announced three more national parks in the province.

Minister Ishtiaq said that the merger would not only save resources, but would also resolve the issue of duplication. He expected over Rs30 million saving for the government annually after merger of the two departments. “The problem is that employees of the two departments evade responsibilities and ignore offences in their areas of jurisdiction,” he said.

He said that officials of the wildlife remained indifferent when they came across any forest-related offences during duty and same was the case with forest staff in connection with wildlife offences.

But officials disagreed with the minister’s remarks and alleged that some vested interests in the forest department were trying to increase “grazing area” for themselves in the name of merger. They said that forest and wildlife were two different subjects, which required specialised expertise and qualifications and experts in forestry did not understand wildlife.

“How a department (forest), which can’t protect forests, will look after wildlife and its attached sectors,” questioned an official. He said that wildlife department had prosecuted over 62 offences in various courts for violation in Ayubia National Park as more than 200 cases were reported in other national parks of the province.

“We will reduce the drug prices when the value of the dollar drops against the rupee. As medicines are imported, the devaluation of the rupee necessitated the increase in the prices,” he told media persons after visiting the Holy Family Hospital (HFH).

The minister said pharmaceutical companies had demanded an increase of 30pc in the drug prices but the government agreed only to 15pc.

The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) on Jan 11 announced up to 15pc increase in the prices of various medicines. The surge drew criticism from the citizens and the opposition parties who demanded the government withdraw the decision as it would create problems for the people.

The minister said healthcare was ignored in the past but the PTI government was giving special attention to the sector at the direction of Prime Minister Imran Khan. He said the prime minister wanted to provide better healthcare facilities to the citizens in all government hospitals.

The minister said more than 20 million health cards would be issued by the end of this month.

“These health cards will enable the citizens to receive medical treatment both at the government and private hospitals,” he said, adding the financial package under the health cards had also been doubled.

The government is working to establish three new hospitals and a nursing university in Islamabad to lessen the patient load on the existing hospitals.

He said after the visit of the prime minister to the HFH, 100 new beds were being added to its mother and child department.

He said the prime minister expressed his concerns after seeing two or three expecting mothers sharing a single bed in the hospital.

“The prime minister assigned me the task to improve the facilities in the hospital so patients could get better healthcare facilities without any hurdle,” he said.

“More than three million people get medical care annually at the HFH and it will be made a state-of-the-art hospital.”

He said for patient attendants, a shelter home was being constructed and such a facility would also be provided at Benazir Bhutto Hospital and District Headquarters Hospital.

The minister said incubators, baby carts, warmers and other facilities were also being provided to the hospital.

“The Punjab government has been asked to ensure supply of medicines to the government hospitals,” he said.

The government will also recruit more staff to overcome the shortage in the hospitals. He said 150 employees would be recruited to improve the sanitation facilities at the HFH soon. He said new washrooms would also be constructed in the hospital.

The minister said he was monitoring the work at the hospital and the residents would seen the change within a week. He said special counters had been established at the hospital to resolve complaints of the patients.

",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Education has decided to fill only six of the 14 vacant Pakistan chairs in foreign universities.

The ministry recently stopped the process of sending shortlisted candidates to represent Pakistan in 14 foreign universities. The candidates were finalised by a committee headed by Senator Syed Muzafar Hussain Shah last year.

The education ministry now has decided to advertise the entire process afresh.

“We are going to re-advertise these positions within two weeks and in the first phase we will make appointments on four to six chairs instead of 14,” said the ministry’s Joint Education Adviser Rafiq Tahir.

He said in the first phase appointments would be made in important countries.

Education ministry says it will fill only six of the 14 vacant chairs abroad

Sources said because of budgetary constraints the ministry had decided to reduce the foreign chairs. Last year when the selection was finalised, there was a budget of around Rs50 million which was recently reduced by the federal government to Rs15 million.

The process to select candidates for the positions faced delay for the last around a decade. Pakistan has chairs in 14 foreign universities, including Germany, Turkey and China, which have been vacant for six to 10 years.

The chairs were set up on reciprocal basis and their holders used to deliver lectures aimed at promoting Urdu and the culture and history of Pakistan.

Earlier, the Cabinet Division used to deal with the issue but last year the function was given to the ministry of education.

A senior faculty member of Quaid-i-Azam University said chairs at international universities were a tool to build the country’s image.

“These chairs play an important role in promoting Pakistan’s culture and image. The appointees are academic ambassadors but unfortunately our bureaucrats are not taking this important issue seriously.”

He said India had almost 300 chairs in world’s top university where its scholars were playing an important role to promote their country’s interest.

A Pakistani scholar, who was shortlisted by the committee last year, said after a number of meetings he was selected but so far the education ministry has failed to complete the process.

“Now, we are being told that the process is going to be re-advertised which is unfortunate and a joke with scholars,” he said.

Last year, 28 scholars, two each against one post, were finalised by the committee. He said instead of reducing the number of chairs, the government should appoint more scholars to promote the country’s soft image in the world.

",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: Nearly a month after it was formed, the commission to review Islamabad’s master plan has yet to start working, raising the question of whether it will be able to complete its task within the stipulated six months.

The 12-member commission was formed on Dec 20 last year, but sources said an introductory meeting has not been convinced so far.

A source in the Capital Development Authority, who asked not to be named, said nearly a month – 25 days – has passed, but an initial meeting of the commission has not been called.

According to a notification issued by the Ministry of Interior on Dec 28, the chairman of the CDA will act as the convenor of the commission until someone from the private sector is appointment CDA chairman.

The current CDA chairman, Afzal Latif, is on leave for four months, and Islamabad Chief Commissioner Amer Ali Ahmed has been given additional charge of the office chairman in his absence.

Mr Ahmed was appointed on Thursday but has yet to take charge because his new assignment has not been notified.

MNA Ali Awan, adviser to the prime minister on CDA affairs, told Dawn he would look into the issue.

“The revision of Islamabad’s master plan is highly imported as this work was not carried out in the past. We will check why the first meeting has not even been called yet,” he said.

The original developers the capital’s master plan had recommended revising the plan every 20 years, but successive governments never made any comprehensive revisions. Instead, a number of selective amendments were made from time to time, mostly to benefit specific people.

The lack of revisions has resulted in poor planning and the proliferation of illegal construction.

The commission consists of experts tasked with revising the master plan for the next 20 years – from 2020 to 2040. It will also give its perspective on the regularisation of illegal construction in the capital.

The commission’s terms of reference (ToR) state that it will keep in mind the increased participation of the private sector in health and education when recommending how to resolve this issue.

There are currently more than 300 private schools operating in the city’s residential sectors, along with a large number of healthcare facilities, in violation of CDA by-laws.

The commission will also make proposals for short, medium and long-term development and may amend its ToRs with the government’s approval.

On Sunday, the Islamabad Guest House Association also demanded the government look into the guesthouse issue. The association’s secretary general, Dr Osman Qazi Khan, said that the commission should look into bread and breakfasts in designated areas.

According to claims circulating on social media, the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) arrested a man from an upscale part of the capital and recovered a large quantity of cocaine from his possession.

It has been claimed that the man supplied cocaine to parties in the capital and was a close friend of the state minister.

A photograph has also been circulated on social media allegedly showing the man standing beside Mr Afridi.

Mr Afridi, however, stated in a video that “criminal-minded people” had uploaded photos with him online and were “giving the impression that they are my friends.”

He said as a political worker, he cannot stop anyone from taking photos standing beside him.

He said he had launched an anti-drugs campaign with the support of the prime minister.

“I am raising awareness against drugs on roads, on buses and in mosques. I have nothing to do with those who are seen in the pictures with me. I assume that the person took the pictures during the anti-drugs campaign. My and Imran Khan’s vision is to make the country drug-free,” he said.

Mr Afridi claimed people were trying to defame him because he was campaigning against drugs.

When contacted, ANF Director Headquarters Riaz Soomro told Dawn: “We are still in the process of investigation, and we are not in a position to confirm or deny whether he had a link to the minister.”

He said it would be “inappropriate” at this stage to link the suspect to the minister.

This is not the first time Mr Afridi has been linked to someone held for possessing drugs.

On Jan 7, after a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior, Mr Afridi said before the press that action would be taken against anyone caught with drugs regardless of their kinship.

Mr Afridi was then asked if he was related to Talal Nadir Afridi, who was arrested in Attock on Dec 11 for drug possession. The minister said: “Whoever he is, action will be taken against him in accordance with the law.”

He went on to say he had an extended family and his father had married thrice.

Nadir Afridi was arrested along with three others for possession of 507 grams of hashish.

The address he gave to the police was House No 3 in the Minister’s Enclave, and he stated his father’s name as Farrukh Jamal Afridi.

PML-N lawmaker Hina Pervaiz Butt had submitted a resolution in the Punjab Assembly after the incident to condemn the recovery of drugs from the state minister’s relative.

Meanwhile, in a statement, the Islamabad police claimed that 12 people were arrested for possession of liquor and drugs.

In the past, the PTI criticised the PML-N for utilising development funds through its parliamentarians. But after coming to power in Punjab, the party sought development proposals from its members of the provincial assembly.

A senior leader of the party told Dawn that the MPAs submitted their development proposals to the government last month but due to the financial crisis the funds were yet to be released.

“PTI’s parliamentary meeting is scheduled to be held in Lahore on Monday to discuss issues pertaining to the ruling party members in their respective districts. The MPAs will ask the provincial government to start development works.”

Punjab govt collects proposals from ruling party lawmakers to carry out development works worth Rs100m each

He said the ruling party members had also decided to raise the issue of bureaucracy as senior officials of the district administrations were not cooperating with them to resolve problems of the citizens.

He said the MPAs also wanted to launch new projects in their areas, especially in those union councils which were neglected during the tenure of the PML-N government.

He said the party also wanted to change the local government system in the province as at present the PML-N has a majority in all the municipal corporations and district councils. Any changes to the local government law could only be made through the provincial assembly but the PTI does not have the required majority in the house.

In this situation, he added, the provincial government had allocated Rs100 million for each ruling party MPA and asked them to submit their development proposals.

“We have submitted the development proposals to the Punjab government which would release the funds soon,” Chaudhry Adnan, PTI MPA from Rawalpindi city, told Dawn.

He said there was a dire need to launch new projects in many areas as the previous government remained busy in executing projects to make commissions.

“The shortage of water and other issues were ignored in the past and being elected representatives of the people it is our duty to inform the government about it,” he said.

The MPA said the PTI lawmakers had presented their proposals to the government which would spend funds on the sectors as pointed out by the MPAs.

When contacted, MPA Umer Tanveer of the PTI said the development funds would be spent by the government and the role of the ruling party MPAs was only to identify problems of the residents.

“The provincial government allocated Rs100 million for each constituency and in this regard we will give a presentation in the parliamentary meeting on Jan 14,” he said.

The government would also resolve problems of the citizens in the cantonment areas as the proposals included water supply schemes.

On the other hand, a senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the previous PML-N government in Punjab made a political move before the general elections by preparing the development plan in 2018 and launching many projects.

“More than 50pc work on the projects had been completed on these development schemes worth over Rs3 billion and the provincial government would not take the risk of stopping work on them. These projects have to be completed before launching new schemes.”

The official said the government was facing problems to start new schemes before completing the ongoing ones.

“It is the basic reason behind the delay in the release of funds for the new projects. But the MPAs are hopeful to arrange funds for development schemes in their areas,” he said.

",2019-01-14,"LAHORE: PPP Information Secretary Dr Nafisa Shah says new disclosures are being made about the PTI daily as its leadership is involved in corruption.

Speaking at a press conference along with Munawwar Anjum and Hassan Murtaza here on Sunday, she recalled that the PTI election manifesto was anti-corruption and one Pakistan for all. But, after coming into power, it adopted double standards on corruption, she said.

She said prime minister’s sister Aleema Khan who is caretaker of Shaukat Khanum Hospital’s donations, had been found to be owning $450 million property in New Jersey, US declared in the amnesty scheme in 2017. She asked whether the demand by opposition for investigation of the affair was just or not.

Likewise, she said, financial affairs and contracts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government during the last five years as well as fake accounts of the PTI funds must also be probed.

The PPP leader said Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Afridi talked of use of drugs by Islamabad college girls but the fact is that his own nephew had been caught smuggling drugs and Mr Afridi should decide his punishment on his own.

She told a questioner that the PPP would move every forum including courts against Aleema Khan, Imran Khan, Jahangir Tareen, Aleem Khan and others.

She lamented that names of her party leaders were placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) on the report of a so-called JIT and that despite the Supreme Court orders the same were not being removed from the list. Whereas, she pointed out, the name of Liaquat Jatoi was removed from the list despite investigation.

Ms Shah chided the finance minister for changing stance on national economy. She said Asad Umar took third U-turn in six months as he said Islamabad was not going to the IMF but was giving a second budget. She asked which government would give a second budget in six months.

Responding to a question, she said Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had talked of march on Islamabad on the basis of issues unlike Imran Khan’s attack on parliament. “We are in contact with the masses. With the support of the masses we’ll march on Islamabad when the conditions will become intolerable.”

Answering another question, she said the PPP had taken a principled stance against military courts.

",2019-01-14,"BAHAWALPUR: The female rhinoceros at the National Park Lal Sohanra died on Saturday night.

According to park officials, the 40-year-old rhino has been ‘sick’ for the last few days and was found dead in the artificial lake in the enclave where she lived with the male rhino. Her body was retrieved from the lake after hectic efforts, the officials added.

The pair of rhinos was gifted to Pakistan by Nepal in 1982. On the orders of the then Punjab governor Gen Ghulam Jillani, the pair was housed at the National Park, Lal Sohanra.

The then park administrator late Maj Syed Manzoor Hussain Shah got built a trench-cum-lake for the pair where they used to bath and relax for hours to the joy of those visiting the park, especially the children.

As per park sources, the female rhino was pregnant and had a miscarriage a few days back and might have died because of excessive bleeding that had weakened her.

They said the female rhino had a stillbirth last year.

Park Conservator Javed Gill, who is also the administrator of the facility, told Dawn that a rhino’s average lifespan was 60-70 years and the female could complete around half of it in captivity.

He said a postmortem examination of the dead beast had been ordered to determine the cause of death.

",2019-01-14,"LAHORE: Political parties are now being run through a remote-control mechanism as one cannot talk against the security establishment even in internal discourse, says the Awami National Party leader Afrasiab Khattak.

He was speaking on ‘Progressive Politics in Pakistan’ at ThinkFest here on Sunday.

Terming the prevailing judicial activism a ‘judicial martial law’, he alleged that the Supreme Court chief justice was usurping the executive’s authority.

He called for signing of a document by all political parties like the Charter of Democracy (CoD) to regain the space lost to undemocratic forces. He also talked of lack of democracy within the parties and urged their leaders to rectify the situation to be on a high moral ground in the struggle against undemocratic forces.

Awami Workers’ Party’s Tooba Syed held the “catharsis” of activists through social media responsible for their reluctance to join actual political movements.

The Friday Times editor Aima Khosa didn’t see any progressive movement in the country for the time being, blaming it on a lack of tradition and contemporary difficult conditions. She said the activists needed cadre organisation and political training for becoming part of such organizations.

Akbar S Zaidi, who conducted the session, didn’t agree with Ms Khosa and said in fact difficult conditions enhanced the role and even gave birth to such movements and organisations.

Responding to queries from the audience, Mr Khattak admitted political parties suffered because of not embracing new classes like youth and the urban middle class, while these could not adjust themselves to the changes in political discourse and issues that emerged in the post-Zia period.

In the session on ‘Growth, IMF and Pakistan Economy’, former finance minister Salman Shah called for improving agriculture productivity through better water management, diverting Chinese investment, special economic zones, renegotiating free trade agreement with China to check its tilt towards Beijing, introducing public-private partnership concept in infrastructure development.

Miftah Ismael, who was financial advisor during PML-N government, downplayed the fears of Pakistan being put on black list by the FATF saying the country had earlier been on the list (without any serious harm) in 2008-09.

He said Islamabad could not substitute imports with exports for want of costly raw material used in many industries. Talking of lack of foreign visitors, he said at Dhaka more foreign airliners landed than Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore combined.

Ex-finance minister Hafeez Pasha advised the rulers not to (negatively) touch the National Finance Commission award issues and called for reducing the size of bureaucratic setup in Islamabad.

",2019-01-14,"SUKKUR: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that nobody can stop him from going abroad for official visits or pilgrimage.

“Can anyone stop me if I have to perform Haj or Umra; or ziaraat in Iraq?” he asked.

The chief minister was speaking to the media after attending the Valima ceremony of former MPA Syed Jawed Ali Shah’s son here on Sunday.

He said he had undertaken just a couple of private foreign tours so far since becoming the chief minister. “By the way, I don’t intend to go abroad in near future,” he added.

Mr Shah said he was not worried about placement of his name on the exit control list (ECL).

Apparently referring to Local Govt Minister Saeed Ghani’s recent statement regarding a tit-for-tat action over foreign travel ban on the CM and certain other PPP leaders, Mr Shah said there would be no disruption in the prime minister’s or any federal minister’s visit to Sindh on the part of the provincial government.

“Imran Khan is the Prime Minister of the country; he is free to go anywhere he wants to go,” the CM said.

Commenting on alleged moves to dislodge his government, Mr Shah said the Sindh government would stay until it enjoyed support of the masses and PPP leadership. He said no conspiracy against his government would succeed. “Those sitting in Islamabad ought to tell me which of his or his government’s act had actually angered them,” he added.

In reply to a question, he said it was the media that keenly projected the unparliamentary language uttered guests at various programmes and other people. “If the media stops this practice, the trend will certainly die down,” he argued.

Answering a question about future of military courts, the chief minister said that his party had already conveyed its stance on the subject to the authorities concerned.

",2019-01-14,"SUKKUR: The Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), currently engaged in political manoeuvring amid persisting uncertainty about future of the Sindh government, held a crucial meeting on Sunday at Gohar Palace in Khangarh, Ghotki district, ahead of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Jan 27 visit to Sindh.

The meeting was presided over by GDA chief Pir Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi (Pir Sahib Pagara) and attended by other top alliance leaders including Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi, Ayaz Latif Palijo, Dr Hasnain Mirza, Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim, Irfanullah Marwat, Ghulam Murtaza Jatoi, Ghous Bakhsh Khan Mahar and the host, MPA Sardar Ali Gohar Khan Mahar.

Speaking to the media after the meeting, both Sardar Mahar and GDA secretary general Ayaz Palijo said that a “change” in Sindh through constitutional means was discussed. They said the alliance would continue to support Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf as its ally at the Centre as there was a consensus among leaderships of both entities, as well as all other stakeholders of the state, on rooting out corruption from the country.

‘Constitutional change’ in Sindh discussed, required support within assembly claimed

Regarding GDA’s efforts to dislodge Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) from power corridors in Sindh, Mr Palijo argued that the PPP government had destroyed the agriculture sector in the province over the decade-long rule over it, besides plaguing all departments with corruption.

“They have devastated growers in Sindh,” he said, adding that the province was not getting its due share in the Indus water while Wapda and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) remained indifferent to the issue.

Mr Palijo categorically stated that the GDA would not support any unconstitutional move aimed about a change of government in Sindh. He said GDA would play a vital role in bringing about such a change through constitutional moves. “There are dozens of members of the Sindh Assembly in contact with Pir Pagara and Sardar Ali Gohar Khan Mahar who are willing to support such a move,” he said.

He said GDA had already started mobilising public support from Ghotki district and similar efforts would be made in all other districts very soon. He said GDA’s aim was to make the country corruption-free.

Any strategy in this regard, if chalked out, would certainly be a joint effort of the GDA and PTI, he said.

Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi told the media said there would be an in-house change in the Sindh Assembly. It would not come through unconstitutional means, he said, adding that GDA would not be part of any unconstitutional change.

Referring to PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s warning to the PTI government over a possible “invasion of Islamabad” by oppressed people of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pir Rashdi said: “The Zardari party is not strong enough to invade even Ghotki let alone Islamabad ... the party has done massive corruption in Sindh ... they have to face accountability first”

Commenting on Prime Minister’s scheduled visit to Ghotki, MPA Ali Gohar Mahar said that he would seek a big package for Sindh from the Centre which should include establishment of a university in Ghotki.

He said many areas of the district were without gas though it was the first area of Sindh where natural gas was discovered in 1993 and first well of the province was sunk here. No other benefits were being given to Ghotki against the gas deposits and supplies.

Former chief minister Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim said that the prime minister was coming to Sindh to know about the issues confronting Sindh. He said Mr Khan would be apprised of all pressing issues. He said there were certain issues supposed to be addressed by the provincial government but it was shifting all responsibilities to the federal government.

He hinted that a change in Sindh was imminent “once the accountability process in the province is completed”.

After the meeting, Pir Pagara left for the Tar Ghar bungalow — the residence of Sardar Ali Gohar Mahar in Sardar Garh — for an overnight stay.

When the commission, which is set to complete its tenure on Jan 15, resumed its sitting, Advocate General, Sindh, Salman Talibuddin made a statement on the behalf of the provincial government.

He appreciated the working of the commission and said that its tenure should be extended since many ongoing schemes would be better monitored by the commission while a number of other schemes were in a formative stage.

The AG also tendered an apology regarding the comments of an additional advocate general made about the commission last week before the Supreme Court when its final report was submitted in the apex court.

He further said that when the same matter would be taken up for hearing by the apex court on Monday, the law officer of Sindh will record “no objection” to the commission’s final report.

Shahab Usto, who had petitioned the apex court regarding water and sanitation issues in Sindh, also endorsed the proposal of the advocate general regarding continuation of the commission.

However, the commission, headed by retried Justice Amir Hani Muslim, said that it was the sole domain of the Supreme Court to consider such a request independently.

Justice Muslim had already requested the apex court that he was stepping down upon the completion of his tenure on Jan 15 due to personal reasons and the Supreme Court had also allowed it.

They added that the police with the petitioner had gone to the flat to arrest the man on a court order to present the petitioner’s wife and his three daughters in court on the next hearing of the case.

“An incident of firing took place within the remit of the New Town police station when the additional SHO Darakhshan went with applicant Sohail Mughal on a court order to arrest Munawar Ali,” said Karachi East SSP Azfar Mahesar.

Gulshan SP Tahir Noorani told media that Sohail Mughal had filed an abduction case of his family against Munawar Ali, which was quashed by the court.

However, the court directed the Darakshan police on Dec 31, 2018 on a petition of the suspect to recover the suspect’s three daughters and wife and present them in court on Jan 17, East SSP Azfar Mahesar said.

The petitioner was present during the last hearing of the case and stated that the “police authorities have not produced the ladies”.

He had urged the court to issue an ‘appropriate action’ against the respondents.

The New Town police officer in whose jurisdiction the incident took place told Dawn that when petitioner Sohail Mughal with the additional SHO of Darakhshan arrived at the apartment in Sharafabad, Munawar Ali was already present at the gate of the multi-storey building.

However, before the police could arrest him, Mughal, who had hidden a 9mm pistol in his shalwar, took out the gun and opened fire on Munawar.

He fired four shots as a result of which Munawar sustained two bullet wounds and was taken by the additional SHO to the Liaquat National Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Later, the body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.

Dr Seemin Jamali, executive director of the hospital, said that Munawar had received two bullet wounds on his chest and abdomen.

The police arrested Sohail Mughal with the pistol and collected spent bullet casings from the crime scene.

The New Town police officer said that neighbours told the police that the suspect’s wife had taken ‘divorce’ from him and was living with Munawar Ali with her three daughters.

The police detained the additional SHO of Darakhshan with other policemen on charges of criminal negligence.

DIG East Amir Farooqi said a murder case would be registered against Sohail Mughal and another case pertaining to criminal negligence against the Darakhshan policemen.

The hospital administration said more than 12,000 people had arrived for interviews. The police, however, offered a figure of around 30,000.

It was beyond expectations for the hospital administration, yet the happenings reflected how grave the issue of unemployment was.

While witnesses said police resorted to baton-charge, a senior police officer denied that the police took such an action against the people gathered there.

The witnesses said the candidates had begun arriving outside the hospital since the early hours of Sunday morning. Many of them had graduate degrees, yet they wanted the jobs because of unemployment.

The long queues soon turned into unruly gatherings before all that merged into a mob that was restless and raucous, yet they restrained themselves from becoming violent.

Some of the candidates came for walk-in interviews were seen climbing the barricades formed by the hospital administration and the local police. A number of them clambered to the rooftop.

Police’s decision to adopt mild tactics saved the day and stemmed the situation from going even graver and, fortunately, the general anguish remained suppressed and failed to create stampede.

The situation, however, warranted for further fortification and the paramilitary Rangers were called in.

The hospital had established 13 places — eight for men, four for women and one for the disabled persons — to take interviews of candidates.

Witnesses said although the counters for men, women and disabled persons were safely distant from each other outside the outpatient department of the hospital, yet, the hullaballoo at the men’s counters created concern on other areas.

“There were dozens of disabled persons and some of them could not get the tokens for interviews because of the chaos and they returned,” said a witness.

Another said the situation at the women’s counters remained normal where it was ensured — both by the candidates and the administration — to maintain calm.

SSP-City Muquddus Haider told Dawn that the police had advised the hospital administration that they should conduct interviews of the candidates in phases on different days to avoid a stampede-like situation and ensure the order but their advice was ostensibly not entertained by the authorities at the health facility.

The officer said people had arrived from across Sindh along with their relatives.

He also denied reports that the police resorted to baton-charge.

Another officer, Eidgah SHO Nadeem Haider said several thousand people had gathered outside the hospital for interviews.

The medical superintendent of the hospital said they had offered 300 jobs for lower grades for which they had called direct interviews.

“Rest assured,” said hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Sabir Memon, “everyone who has come here will be interviewed; no matter, how much time it takes. We are here to manage all this.”

A senior health official said: “Everything is normal now. The recruitment is being made in accordance with the set SOPs [standard operating procedures].”

SSP Rao Anwar with his subordinates has been booked for killing Naqeeb and three others after dubbing them ‘Taliban militants’ in a ‘fake’ shoot-out on Jan 13, 2018.

The Anti-Terrorism Court No 2 had granted bail to Rao in the two cases pertaining to the kidnapping and murder as well as registering fake criminal cases against the victims in July last.

An antiterrorism court is set to announce order on bail pleas of 10 policemen today

The killing of the young Mehsud had sparked widespread protests by the civil society and Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar took suo motu notice of the killings.

After eluding law enforcers for two months and upon being offered opportunities by the CJP to surrender, the former SSP had finally appeared before the Supreme Court and was subsequently arrested in Islamabad.

Instead of detaining him in the Karachi central prison, jail authorities had shifted him to a house due to alleged security concerns, declaring it a sub-jail in the Malir Cantonment area.

Four other suspects — former DSP Qamar, Muhammad Yaseen, Supurd Hussain and Khizar Hayat — have also been granted bail.

After slain model’s father Khan Muhammad Mehsud, who is the complainant in the main case, showed no confidence in the ATC-II, the Sindh High Court had transferred the cases to the ATC-III on Nov 5.

“The formal trial has not taken off so far because none of the suspects has been indicted by the trial court in the cases,” Advocate Salahuddin Panhwar, the counsel for the complainant Mehsud, had told Dawn after attending the last hearing on Jan 6.

On the last hearing, the ATC-III had reserved its order on applications filed by 10 police officials, who remained absconding for as many months and then approached the court seeking pre-arrest bail to avoid their arrest in the cases.

“The court will announce its verdict on their bail pleas on Jan 14 [today],” judicial staff told Dawn, adding that the hearing in the main case was fixed for Jan 30.

Around six suspended police officials — Sub-Inspector Sheikh Mohammad Shoaib alias Shoaib Shooter, SI Gada Hussain, SI Amanullah Marwat, Head Constable Shafqat Hussain, Constables Mohsin Abbas, Raja Shamim, Rana Riaz — are still absconding in the case.

Police probe finds Rao Anwar, others guilty

On May 2, 2018 the trial court had accepted a supplementary investigation report submitted by investigating officer SSP Dr Rizwan Ahmed, who had charge-sheeted all the suspended policemen in the cases.

The supplementary charge sheet that mentioned that the forensic reports of the weapons, a technical analysis of the call detail records (CDR), TV interviews of Rao Anwar and circumstantial evidence suggested the involvement of Rao Anwar and his team members in the extrajudicial killing and dubbing the victims as terrorists.

There was no criminal record of the victims against whom the suspects had highlighted ‘fake stories in the media’ to hush up the extrajudicial killings, the supplementary charge sheet said, alleging that during the investigation the nominated policemen were also found involved in destroying evidence, misusing their official authority in an attempt to cover up their other unlawful acts.

It further mentioned that in the light of all the evidence and statements of the witnesses, the arrested suspects, including Rao Anwar, were involved in kidnapping for ransom, murder and destruction of the evidence.

It had stated that the CDR showed the presence of Rao Anwar at the crime scene between 2.55am and 3.21am, adding that his presence was also recorded near the New Sabzi Mandi on Superhighway on Jan 4, 5, 8, 9 and 13.

The CDR analysis further revealed that PC Feroze, former SHO Marwat and ASI Hussain were present at the crime scene together on Jan 12, 2018 while the presence of SI Anwar, ASI Hussain, ASI Khair Mohammad and Raja Shamim was also recorded on Jan 13 last year.

It showed that PC Feroze and ASI Hussain contacted each other through mobile phones 18 times on the day of the incident and a day before it while PC Feroze also changed his mobile SIM cards and mobile phones several times after the incident.

“The digital evidence show the important role of the suspects in planning and execution of the fake encounter, while it also suggest their involvement in failure to report the crime and abetting the police party in the fake encounter,” it stated.

The CDR analysis further showed that mobile phones of Mohsin Abbas and Raja Riaz were switched off at the time of the encounter and former DSP Qamar Ahmed had constantly been in contact with the police involved in the fake encounter.

It further mentioned that former ASI Allahyar, former HC Mohammad Iqbal, former constables Arshad Ali, Ghulam Nazik, Shafiq Ahmed and Abdul Wali were found involved in kidnapping Naqeeb and his friends from the Sher Agha hotel and taking them to the Abbas Town police post and trying to cover up the whole episode, which was an offence under the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

It added that former constables Abbas and Imran Kazmi were found involved in the kidnapping, torture and demanding ransom for the victims’ release.

It said former ASI Akbar Mallah’s role in the fake encounter was determined while the former DSP was found involved in making entries of the fake encounter, tampering with the evidence and facilitating the police party involved in fake encounter.

The supplementary charge sheet revealed that there was no criminal record of the victims against whom the suspects had highlighted fake stories in the media to hush up the extrajudicial killings. The police were also found involved in destroying the evidence, misusing their official authority in an attempt to cover up their other unlawful acts.

The supplementary charge sheet mentioned that in the light of all the evidence and statements of the witnesses, the arrested suspects, including Rao Anwar, were involved in kidnapping for ransom, murder and destroying the evidence.

Court yet to take up eyewitness’s affidavit

The trial court has yet to consider a personal affidavit filed by HC Shahzada Jahangir in which he deviated from his initial statement given to the police against Rao Anwar and his subordinates regarding their involvement in the extrajudicial killing.

In the affidavit, he said that he was not present at the place of the incident on January 13, 2018.

Deviating from his earlier statement, Jahangir stated that after seven or eight days of his arrest he was threatened and forced to give a statement. He had alleged that he was coerced to give the statement, which was not based on facts and the police had tortured him.

Earlier, he had told the IO that he was a close aide of then Shah Latif Town SHO Marwat, who on Jan 13 called him at the place of incident and upon arriving there he found the SHO and other police officials present there while the four detained men were also in their custody.

In the meantime, Rao Anwar, DSP Qamar, then SHO Shaikh and other police officials also arrived there and then Marwat, Shoaib and others took the detained men to an abandoned poultry farm, he said, adding that they heard gunshots and thereafter Marwat and other police officials came out of the poultry farm and asked him to do the paperwork.

He said that he found the bodies of the detained men in the building.

",2019-01-14,"PAKISTAN’S labour market segmentation shows the concentration of ethnicities along occupational lines. The ethnic composition in several professions, however, is visibly changing. For policymakers this insight can be helpful for developing effective interventions to better harness the country’s most valuable asset: its human capital.

Several economic, political and social factors push ethnic groups towards specific occupations. Generally, it appears that the choice of occupation is a cumulative function of an individual’s human and social capital and position on the social scale.

Currently the national labour database does not shed light on this dimension. The Labour Force Survey 2017-18 launched and posted on the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) last week did not reveal the ethnic composition of the labour force in Pakistan.

Shaista Sohail, secretary PBS, who holds an additional charge of chief statistician, joined the organisation last month. She acknowledged weaknesses in the current database of the country.

“We wish to make data truly reflective of the reality by improving its efficacy. The organisation is in the process of transformation. Instead of limiting change to administrative steps we wish to invite International Labour Organisation experts and representatives of civil society, to bring about necessary changes in the methodology and the framework of data collection and processing,” she told Dawn over phone from Islamabad.

‘For a better understanding of the quiet societal transformation, it would also be relevant to probe the reasons for the domination of certain ethnicities in specific occupations. The starting point, however, is to collect data’

“I believe that the participation rate of women is under-reported as we can see an increasing number of ladies serving in the retail and fast food chains, etc. It is also absolutely necessary to improve the quality of agriculture data to include information on organic farming in Pakistan,” she said.

“We are considering inducting young people and trained analysts to make this organisation dynamic so that it may better serve its purpose and assist policymakers and researchers,” Ms Sohail concluded.

In Pakistan, quite a few preconceived perceptions regarding professions based on ethnicity abound. These include: martial services are supposed to be mostly dominated by people from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; transporters, cobblers, unskilled construction workers are apparently more often Pakhtuns.

Other popular perceptions include: pharmacists and sweatmeat merchants are supposed to be dominated by Sindhis, low-grade civil servants, semi-skilled workers and khepias (agents who make foreign visits for the informal sale-purchase of goods) are thought to be disproportionately Urdu speaking, stockbrokers and gold merchants are supposed to be mostly Memons, while most carpenters and nurses are conceived to be Punjabis.

Shaukat Khattak, a senior officer informed that national labour statistics are survey based. “PBS carries out an extensive exercise to collect labour data. In all, 42,000 households are surveyed in four provinces and 6,000 are surveyed in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The survey form currently does not include a question on ethnicity of respondents though we do ask about the profession,” he commented.

The Labour Survey 2017-18 makes very broad 22 occupational classifications but does not go beyond gender and rural-urban dimensions. Retail and mechanics are clubbed together. Transport and storage is one category. Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply is another classification.

According to the current data 38.4 per cent of labour is absorbed in agriculture, forestry and fishing, 16.5pc in manufacturing, 14pc in wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles account for 14.9pc, transport and storage for 5.6pc and public administration, defence and compulsory social security for 2.4pc and other services activities for 2.1pc. Participation in all other categories is less than 1pc.

Some occupations in Pakistan may still have specific ethnicities dominating them but this trend has weakened with urbanisation and the influx of people of other nationalities in every profession, it is observed.

“For a better understanding of the quiet societal transformation it would also be relevant to probe the reasons for domination of certain ethnicities in specific occupations. The starting point, however, is to collect data that sheds some light on this dimension of the labour market.

“This information may help carve out strategies of cross-ethnic harmony based on policies insuring equal opportunity for all as the country learned the hard way the pitfalls of ethnic discrimination when the East-wing seceded,” commented an analyst.

“It is only when people are treated by the ruling clique as an asset and not a liability that they start caring to dissect data for evidence-based planning to improve governance quality, ensure equitable sharing and equal opportunity. Currently, disparities are rampant in Pakistan. It is hoped that a stable democratic government will prove to be more caring,” he added.

",2019-01-14,"The year began in Tharparkar — Pakistan’s biggest arid region with large human and livestock populations — with inhabitants facing drought yet again.

Droughts and famines are a regular feature of life in Tharparkar. Barring a few pockets that received rainfall in 2017, the rest of the area has not been getting any rain for the last four years. Locals believe droughts usually come to an end with enough rainfall that enables the farming community to grow seasonal crops and produce sufficient fodder for livestock, which is their prime asset.

Thar’s agro-pastoral life revolves around water and fodder. Provincial and federal governments tend to address the issues faced by the local population using a relief-based approach. A sustainable, institutional oversight has so far eluded this least developed region where people endure harsh conditions regularly. This is despite the fact that Thar is blessed with a fascinating landscape that mesmerises tourists after every monsoon rainfall.

Climate change has also affected the rainfall cycle in Thar, which receives the annual drizzle around August-September. But the May-July period is considered ideal for the sowing of crops as farmers hope to have better per-acre yields in the seasonal crops like bajra. Late sowing in September leads to lower yields.

No permanent arrangement to ensure fodder availability exists in Thar, although livestock plays a central role in sustaining economic life in the area

Every drought triggers migration among communities. This migration is in addition to the seasonal ones that take place at the time of cotton-picking or sugar cane and wheat harvesting. Groundwater levels drop considerably in the absence of rainfall. Livestock, which is the community’s only source of livelihood, forces them to leave their area in search of fodder and water in canal command areas.

No permanent arrangement for fodder availability, like fodder banks, exists in Tharparkar during the drought. This is despite the fact that livestock plays a central role in sustaining economic life in the area. It provides them with milk and butter, but animals suffer a loss of immunity during every drought. As a result, milk production drops considerably, causing undernourishment especially among expecting mothers. This makes the survival of malnourished newborns difficult.

Based on the projected animal population number and the human population of 1.6 million as per the latest census, one individual maintains around four animals in Tharparkar. Immunity loss necessitates preventive vaccination among animals, but its coverage is hardly 20pc in Sindh for want of resources, an official admitted.

The livestock sector has a share of 58.92pc within the country’s agriculture sector, which contributed 18.9pc to GDP as per the 2017-18 Economic Survey of Pakistan. The estimated livestock population in 2017 was 41.68m in Sindh. About 6m of them were in Tharparkar, according to Sindh’s livestock department. It makes Thar the district with the highest livestock population.

“We get hardly 25pc vaccination coverage in Sindh and the same goes for Thar,” said a senior livestock department officer. “But there has luckily been no major disaster as the livestock department has hired additional manpower and resources from other districts for vaccination. That’s why the department didn’t draw the ire of the chief justice of Pakistan,” he added.

Changing climatic conditions are causing multiple challenges for Tharparkar, which calls for a paradigm shift at the policy level. The Sindh government needs to look beyond hurried livestock vaccination, wheat distribution and reverse osmosis plants. An increase in livestock’s budgetary allocations — currently Rs1.3bn — is badly needed.

The Punjab government’s initiatives in the arid region of Cholistan offer a cue. As opposed to Thar, Cholistan seems relatively better managed. This is why it has not had any disaster of the kind that Thar has witnessed. The Cholistan area, consisting of 29,000 square kilometres, is spread over Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur and Rahimyar Khan. The Punjab government has also established the Cholistan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences in Bahawalpur, which is affiliated with Glasgow University.

Cholistan, however, had a smaller estimated human population of roughly 220,000 in 2017 along with 1.6m heads of livestock. The Punjab government’s Cholistan Development Authority (CDA) deals with this area exclusively. Within the provincial livestock department, a directorate looks after the affairs of Cholistan.

Dr Ali Raza Abbasi, CDA’s directorate head, considers the drought an opportunity. “We provide livestock farmers with wanda (feed supplement) on a cost-to-cost basis throughout the year at fixed entry/exit points,” he said. He added that ponds are built in the area for human and livestock populations in addition to an old natural waterway that is connected with pumping stations.

Since 2018, he said, his department has been buying camel milk for Rs42 per litre and keeping it in chillers. It is then sold for Rs120 per litre in Lahore. He said that the department also purchased cattle milk in 2010. But the private firms’ intervention jacked up the market price, which benefited farmers. “The animal vaccination coverage in 100pc,” he remarked.

Around 17 chillers (out of 153 in Sindh) were set up in Thar. But those were part of the foreign-funded Sindh Agriculture Growth Project (SAGP). Reportedly, only three of them are functioning. Since a large number of livestock left Thar for want for fodder, milk could not be collected in the rest of the chillers. The provincial livestock department has provided three livestock farmers with solar-powered submersible pumps to lift groundwater and grow fodder on an experimental basis.

India’s Rajasthan and Pakistan’s Thar and Cholistan are part of the same region, said former chairman of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), Dr Mohammad Ashraf. He said reverse osmosis plants are not a solution to Thar’s woes. “Managing these plants is difficult even in urban areas. The Sindh government needs to focus more on rainwater harvesting projects in Thar,” he said.

A draft of the Sindh Drought and Disaster Mitigation Policy 2014 was prepared following the 2014 drought. It proposed that a Thar Development Authority be set up in the area along the lines of CDA. The Sindh Assembly’s relevant committee has okayed the policy, but it still needs the legislature’s nod.

Talking to journalists in Uthal during his visit to Lasbela district on Sunday, the minister said that he had consulted mayors, district and municipal committees’ chairmen, officials of the local government and other people to seek their suggestions for changes in the local bodies’ system.

“Traditions and customs of Balochistan are different from Punjab and other parts of the country and we will introduce the new local government system keeping in view our tribal traditions and customs,” Sardar Bhootani said

According to reports, differences have emerged in the BAP over its candidate for a Senate seat from Balochistan which has fallen vacant after death of Sardar Azam Khan Musakhail.

However, Mr Alyani, who is also president of the BAP, said, “Some elements which are spreading rumours about differences in the party on social media can’t even win union council elections. They are trying to create misunderstanding within the party.”

CM says opponents can’t swallow better performance of his govt

“The BAP is united and making efforts to secure rights of Balochistan and solve the problems being faced by the people of the province,” he said in a statement issued here on Sunday.

The chief minister said, “We contested general elections under the slogan of ‘prosperous Balochistan’ and are trying to implement the manifesto of the party.” However, he added, some people were spreading negative propaganda against the party with rumours that it had weakened.

He criticised previous provincial governments alleging that during their tenures, jobs were sold at high prices and Balochistan remained backward due to their negligence to the issues being faced by the province.

He said that the rulers running the previous governments did not pay attention to the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) that kept Balochistan a poor and deprived province.

Mr Alyani said that his government was making all out efforts to bring a positive and progressive change in the life of the people of Balochistan.

He said that his government would continue making efforts to improve the situation in the province through providing basic facilities to the people and solving their problems.

Referring to the opponents’ criticism on the provincial government’s performance, the CM said those irresponsible politicians could not swallow the performance of the government over the last four months,

“Our government has made record legislation and taken action over major issues the province is facing. Seven meetings of the provincial cabinet have been held so far in which important decisions were taken on the PSDP in the interest of the people of Balochistan,” he said.

Lauding the support of coalition partners, the chief minister said, “They have been supporting us in making decisions for better future of the province.”

",2019-01-14,"SAHIWAL: A farm worker was killed and 16 others were injured in a ‘clash and exchange of fire’ between the administration of Baiel Gunj Military Stud Farm and tenants, commonly called Mazareen, in Pakpattan district on Saturday evening.

The clash reportedly erupted over the removal of a ‘dysfunctional’ power transformer which fed a tube well irrigating the farmland.

Villagers in the nearby farm claimed that heavy firing was heard for 50 minutes. Sources said that 13 tenants and four security personnel of the farm were injured in the clash.

Rescue 1122 sources confirmed that they shifted the injured to the Baiel Ganj Basic Health Unit and the Pakpattan DHQ Hospital.

Pakpattan Health Authority CEO Imtiaz Rana told the media that emergency was declared in the DHQ Hospital. The sources said Mamshad Ahmed, son of Haji Manzoor, succumbed to his wounds sustained in the clash.

As police did not reportedly register the case, some 500 residents and Mazareen from Farid Nagar Colony, adjacent to the farm, marched in protest towards the Pakpattan police chief office.

Carrying the worker’s body, the protesters demanded the registration of an FIR against the culprits.

Later, the protesters assembled outside the deputy commissioner’s office where the sit-in continued for over four hours.

Sources in police confirmed that the DPO office had to call reserve police force to avoid any possible clash around the farm. They said the road connecting Pakpattan with Deepalpur and Kasur had been closed.

The sit-in ended when ­a three-member committee comprising Deputy Com­mis­sioner Ahmed Kamal Maan, DPO Mariya Mah­mood and SP Investigation Syed Abbas Shah met the protest leaders.

Mr Maan told Dawn by phone that the protesters dispersed after an assurance that FIR would be registered under the law.

",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has been accused of setting an example of “harassment” in the case of the Multan Metro Bus Project (MMBP) as the country’s top of the line contractors involved in the project are on bail to avoid their arrest.

According to the Contractors Association of Pakistan (CAP), NAB has challenged engineering estimates made by the Multan Development Authority (MDA) much before the award of the Rs28 billion MMBP contract. Thus the contractors had nothing to do with preparation of these estimates. The only charge is that the engineering estimates were high and led to a loss of Rs1.7bn to the national exchequer. Meanwhile, over Rs3.2bn dues of the contractors are yet to be paid by the MDA.

NAB claims that it has to recover Rs1.7bn from the contractors and, therefore, the anti-graft watchdog is running after the contractors to arrest them, the CAP says. However, the MDA owes twice this amount to the contractors, it adds.

The opposition believes that NAB’s case is weak and the bureau is just using tactics for arm-twisting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leaders by implicating them in the MMBP case.

The contractors’ association has written a letter to NAB Chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal, complaining that audit objections are being treated as criminal cases.

In the letter, the CAP has asked the NAB chief to ensure a fair and transparent probe into mega development projects and expressed the fear that “harassment will drive away investors”.

The CAP has alleged that despite meeting legal requirements and procedures, a group of contractors engaged in the project is being harassed and victimised.

The MMBP was launched in June 2015 and the bus service was inaugurated by the then chief minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, in Jan 2017.

Six top-ranking national and international firms had taken part in the execution of the MMBP. They completed the project two years ago and almost all of them are presently engaged in other national projects.

A source told Dawn that the heads of six firms, who worked on different segments of the MMBP, had obtained pre-arrest bail from court, but the head of another company, who could not get bail, had been arrested by NAB.

The CAP has assured NAB of its support in the probe into the Metro bus project or any other construction project, but said: “We feel that complex construction issues and disputes between construction companies and the government are being dragged into criminal jurisdiction.

“This appears to be due to lack of understanding and expertise of NAB’s investigation officers with International Federation of Consulting Engineers [FIDIC] conditions, besides other complex technical and contractual matters.”

The letter says that contractual disputes and audit objections need to be segregated from criminal proceedings.

It has said that the construction sector of Pakistan is running businesses worth trillions of rupees, giving employment to millions of people and making huge investments.

“It may also be considered that we are the engines of growth and contribute towards national economy in various ways by paying direct and indirect taxes, generating direct and indirect employment, driving the steel, cement, glass and tiles industries as being major consumers of such products,” the CAP letter says.

The contractors’ association has said: “We are the ones building dams, roads, motorways, houses, schools, universities and hospitals for the nation of international standards and at most economical prices.”

A spokesman for NAB said that four firms involved in the project were ready to return some amount under voluntary return (VR) deals. “There must be something wrong. That is why the contractors are ready to return the money to the government exchequer,” he added.

He said that a reference had been prepared against officials of the Multan Development Authority for “illegal” acquisition of state land for the project.

The NAB spokesman said that the inquiry into the MMBP covered four main dimensions — evaluation of feasibility study and approval of the project; evaluation of bidding process, award of the contract, execution of works, international procurements, payments made to contractors, sub-contractors and vendors; evaluation of land acquisition process; and tracking/trailing of financial transactions into accounts of M/s Yabaite China.

He said that NAB Multan was conducting investigations as per laws and it would send its report to the bureau’s headquarters for scrutiny and review. The report will be presented before the executive board of NAB to decide further course of action.

",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly is set to go into its seventh session on Monday (today) with Speaker Asad Qaiser still struggling with the formation of the house committees as the opposition parties flexing its muscles to give a tough time to the ruling coalition on a number of issues, including the ongoing energy crisis, alleged one-sided accountability process, the government’s move to present another mini-budget and the recent increase in the prices of medicines.

The main opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is also planning a strong protest on the floor of the assembly, if the speaker does not issue the production order for former railways minister Khwaja Saad Rafique, who has been in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) along with his brother Salman Rafique in connection with an inquiry into a housing society scam.

Sources in the National Assembly Secretariat told Dawn that the speaker had already issued the production order for Leader of the Opposition Shahbaz Sharif while the process of the issuance of the production order for Mr Rafique was under way.

Seventh session of National Assembly begins today

Mr Sharif has been attending the NA sessions and meetings of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on the speaker’s production orders since his arrest by NAB on Oct 6 last year in the Ashiyana housing scam.

Mr Rafique had been arrested by NAB on Dec 11 last year at a time when the assembly was already in session. The opposition parties had lodged a strong protest and even boycotted most of the sittings before the speaker issued production order only a day before prorogation of the house on Dec 21.

The speaker has already summoned a meeting of the House Business Advisory Committee comprising representatives of all the parties present in the assembly before start of the session in which he is expected to take up the issue of the formation of the committees, besides discussing the agenda for the upcoming session which is expected to continue for more than two weeks as the government intends to present a mini-budget on Jan 23.

Finance Minister Asad Umar, while speaking to the members of the business community during his visit to the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Saturday, had announced that the government would present a mini-budget on Jan 23 and dispelled the impression that it would be loaded with new taxes.

Mr Umar had admitted that last year had been difficult not only for the government but also for the business community as during the five months (July-November) of the current financial year, only $818 million came under Foreign Direct Investment against $1.35 billion in the same period last financial year.

The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the PML-N are questioning the government’s move to present second mini-budget in less than six months.

Strongly opposing the plan, PPP’s vice president Senator Sherry Rehman had asked if the government, which was determined to bring about a revolution, would introduce mini-budgets every four months. She alleged that the mini-budget was being unveiled to meet the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund.

She regretted that just a day after an increase in the prices of drugs, the government announced its plans about unveiling a mini-budget.

Similarly, the PML-N leaders, including former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, had also questioned the government’s move to present another mini-budget. Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, the PML-N leaders had lashed out at the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government for its “directionless and failed” economic policies, which had drastically brought down the country’s growth rate in just five months.

House committees

Despite succeeding in breaking the deadlock between the government and the opposition over the issue of the PAC chairmanship last month, Speaker Asad Qaiser is still struggling to complete the process of the formation of house committees.

The delay in the formation of over three dozen committees has badly affected the legislative work of parliament, and the National Assembly which came into existence in August after the general elections held in July is functioning with only two committees, including the PAC.

Sources said that an understanding between the government and the opposition had already been reached on the distribution of the chairmanship of 38 standing committees. Under the agreed formula, the chairmanship of 18 committees would go to the opposition while the remaining 20 committees would be headed by the PTI and its allies.

However, they said, the two sides were yet to discuss the committees to be distributed among the treasury and the opposition members. The opposition parties, the sources said, wanted to head the important committees like interior, foreign affairs, power and finance.

The speaker had met Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan and the opposition leaders in the last two days and after his meeting with the government and the opposition representatives, he expressed the hope that he would constitute the committees during the session.

Meanwhile, the NA Secretariat on Sunday issued a nine-point agenda for the Monday’s sitting which includes presentation of a report by the government on “I-Voting Pilot test in 35 constituencies held on October 14 last year, as required under Section 94 of the Elections Act, 2017”.

“The upcoming January 23 mini-budget will lay a foundation of Pakistan’s strong economy,” he said and added that the PTI government would come up to the expectations of people.

The information minister’s remarks come a day after Finance Minister Asad Umar on Saturday dispelled the impression that the upcoming mini-budget would be loaded with new taxes. While addressing members of the business community in Karachi, Mr Umar had said that the mini-budget would focus on ease of doing business and measures to facilitate trade and industrialisation.

Says governance will improve in two to three years

The information minister urged people to have trust in the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, adding that governance would improve in two to three years.

“Have patience for two to three years and this government’s governance will be of par excellence,” he told the media at ThinkFest at Alhamra Arts Council.

Mr Chaudhry said PM Khan did not believe in giving relief (NRO) to any corrupt.

“One has already landed in jail, while the other will follow suit,” he said while referring to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and ex-president Asif Ali Zardari, respectively.

He reiterated that Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari were pressurising (the government) in and out of parliament but they would not get any NRO.

The information minister said that Mr Sharif’s and Mr Zardari’s parties had collapsed.

“They have dug their political graves with their style of politics. We didn’t contribute anything [to their troubles],” Mr Chaudhry said.

The minister expressed wonder over the way the trial of Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif was being conducted, saying they were enjoying all freedom when compared with incarceration of Wali Khan, Faiz Ahmad Faiz and other high-profile people who remained in prison. “Nawaz Sharif flew to London during his trial and his lawyers cross-examined witnesses for 22 days.”

He said that Opposition Leader in National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif was in jail only on papers as he was living in his house and holding meetings and sometimes even called the NAB and prosecutors to appear before him. “I haven’t seen such a trial in my life,” he said and added, “still they are heading towards their political death”.

Responding to a question about former US Ambassador Cameron Munter that Pakistan had misused funds given by the US to counter terrorism as well as promote education, Mr Chaudhry brushed aside Mr Munter’s statement, saying he had retired long ago and did not know anything happening now.

He pointed out that the US had already discontinued the Coalition Support Fund. However, he added, Pakistan-US relations were now improving. He said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had visited Pakistan and later Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi met him in Washington leading to improvement in Pak-US ties.

“I guess Munter has not visited Washington for quite some time,” he said.

Referring to the PPP leaders’ names on the ECL, he said the direction was given by the JIT and the government had just implemented it.

Regarding his re-scheduled visit to Sindh and PPP minister Saeed Ghani’s assertion that he could stop him entering Sindh, Mr Chaudhry said Sindh was part of Pakistan and no one could stop him from going there. He said he was going to Sindh in connection with the affairs of his ministry and would obviously meet his colleagues there.

Mr Chaudhry said the information ministry would come up with a calendar of mega events in the country in a couple of weeks to allow space to thinkers and writers to speak up their minds.

Emphasising the need for promotion of tourism, he said Pakistan had decided to allow visa-free entry to people from 66 countries.

“People from across the globe will be invited to participate in various literary, cultural, social and religious festivals,” the minister said and added that the government was working on mechanisms to keep the events safe.

The execution of Khizar Hayat, sentenced to death in 2003 for killing a colleague, was suspended by the Supreme Court on Saturday, his legal team said, just three days before the 55-year-old was due to be hanged.

The top court will on Monday hold a hearing into whether the execution can go ahead, according to a press release from Justice Project Pakistan, an NGO handling Hayat's case.

The group welcomed the “timely intervention by the highest seat of justice in the land to prevent a wrongful execution,” and also gave Khayat's age as 60.

“The imposition of capital punishment on individuals with psychosocial disabilities is a clear violation of Pakistan's international obligations,” said Agnes Callamard, UN expert on extrajudicial executions and Catalina Devandas, the special rapporteur on disabled rights.

Hayat, who has spent more than 15 years in custody, has been kept in solitary confinement since 2012, the UN experts said, urging the government to halt the execution and questioning the veracity of his conviction.

“During his trial, no evidence or witnesses were called in his defence and no questions were asked regarding his mental health, although he was later diagnosed with a mental health condition and has been receiving treatment for the past 10 years,” they said.

“Implementing the death penalty under these conditions is unlawful and tantamount to an arbitrary execution, as well as a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment,” the UN panel said.

Two years ago, experts from the World Psychiatric Association also appealed to Pakistan to halt his execution, saying he was suffering from schizophrenia and did not understand the crime he had committed.

Addressing an event organised by the Karachi Council on Foreign Relations, the former envoy said Trump and Khan are in power because they both have ""very good political sense"".

""They have the fingertip feeling, as we say, they're very clever with people,"" he said while speaking at the event, 'Brunch & Conversation with Ambassador Cameron Munter', held at Karachi's Movenpick Hotel.

Munter said there was a possibility that if the two leaders meet, they might find some common ground that could help improve their bilateral relationship.""Not the kind that typical analytical diplomats find, but they may find that there is common ground in some way,"" he added.

On January 2, President Trump had expressed his desire to meet Prime Minister Khan for talks on US-led efforts to jump-start the Afghan peace process. “I look forward to meeting the folks from the new leadership in Pakis­tan [and] we will be doing that in not-too-distant future,” he had said.

Following this, the Foreign Office had welcomed Trump’s remarks on ties with Pakistan and said the government was keenly waiting for the engagement at the highest level.

“We look forward to positive engagement with the US at the leadership level,” FO spokesman Dr Mohammad Faisal had said during a weekly media briefing.

",2019-01-13,"The much-awaited inauguration ceremony of the Mohmand Dam scheduled for Sunday was postponed for at least the second time this month, government officials said.

The ceremony for the dam was to be held on January 2 but was rescheduled until today due to a controversy that emerged following the award of the contract of the hydropower project.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Minister Shaukat Yousafzai confirmed to DawnNewsTV that the ceremony today had been postponed.

Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Media Iftikhar Durrani said a new date would be announced after consultation with Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who would attend the inauguration ceremony.

Durrani ruled out the impression that the project's inauguration had been delayed due to any controversies. He said the tender for the project was awarded in the PML-N government's tenure and the incumbent government had no role in the matter.

Chief Justice Nisar had last week taken offence over not being informed about the rescheduling of the ceremony and had said he may not attend.

Justice Nisar has paid close attention to the issue of water scarcity and had ordered the creation of the Dam Fund in July last year ─ a fund that appeals to the general public and overseas Pakistanis for donations for the construction of the Mohmand Dam and the Diamer-Bhasha Dam.

The top judge's initiative was later joined by the prime minister. Within a span of five months, a total of Rs8.46bn was deposited in The Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of Pakistan Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand Dams Fund, according to State Bank of Pakistan data in December 2018.

Justice Nisar and Prime Minister Imran Khan were to be the chief guests of today's event.

Mohmand Dam contract controversy

The dam contract was awarded on a single-bid basis to a consortium of three companies led by Descon, a company previously owned by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, in which he and his family members currently hold ownership stakes.

A second contestant for the bid, a consortium comprising the Frontier Works Organisation, Andritz Hydro and Power China was technically disqualified and its financial bid was not considered, some top-ranking national contractors cited by Dawn said earlier.

The award of the bid to the Descon-led consortium raised questions about a possible conflict of interest and the process of the award.

Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda claimed the controversy around the award of the dam's contract has been created ""on the agenda of international powers"".

He said that Dawood had already resigned from the company before the bidding was held on July 18 ─ before the new government came to power. He added that the PM's adviser had nothing to do with the contract and had no way to influence the bidding process.

Descon only holds 30pc of shares in the consortium and the bids were evaluated by technical experts comprising Nespak, an Australian company, and another foreign firm, according to Vawda.

Wapda Chairman Hussain said that it was coincidental that the single bidder's price was also almost the same as estimated by the government and insisted there was no conflict of interest in the award of the contract to a company having links with a sitting cabinet member.

Although Hussain agreed that Descon was linked to Dawood, he maintained it had nothing to do with the bidding conducted by Wapda and dismissed the notion that he or the body was facing pressure over the groundbreaking of the project.

Abdul Razak Dawood in a statement also explained that he had founded and headed Descon like several other business ventures, but had disclosed all his business associations in writing to the prime minister and resigned from these positions before joining the government to ensure transparency and avoid conflict of interest.

The Mohmand Dam project

The construction of the Rs309 billion Mohmand dam ─ which will be situated on the Swat river in the Manda area ─ is said to be imperative to resolve the problems of water scarcity and electricity shortfall in the country.

A sum of Rs2bn has been allocated for the project in the Public Sector Development Programme 2018-19.

Work on the dam will begin this month and is expected to be complete within five years. It will have the capacity to store 0.676 MAF of water and generate 800 megawatts of electricity. It will also irrigate 16,000 acres of land and increase agricultural production in the area.

",2019-01-13,"ISLAMABAD: Munir Ahmed, 52, has been living in Rawalpindi, where he works as a hawker at the Pirwadhai Bus Stand, for years.

Originally from Peshawar, Mr Ahmed said he earns around Rs1,000 a day, calling out to passengers and trying to persuade them to get the bus to Peshawar. Sometimes he doesn’t get any work at all, because of the lack of buses, transporters’ strikes or a protest in the city.

“I used to spend Rs200 a day on food, and at night I would get a charpoy at the bus stand for Rs60. But since the Panah Gah opened in I-11 last month, I first try to get a charpoy there, because it’s provided for free, and failing that I go to the bus stand,” he told Dawn.

Whether or not he gets a charpoy, Mr Ahmed has breakfast, lunch and dinner at the new shelter - altogether, he is able to save around Rs300 every day, and send more money back to his family every month.

Two shelters — one at the I-11 Sabzi Mandi and one in Tarlai — have been opened by the district administration under orders from the prime minister.

Both the shelters were set up in 20 days; the one in Tarlai can house around 150 men and 50 women, while the one in Sabzi Mandi can house 150 men and women.

There are a number of homeless shelters that have opened across the country, but most are run in tents. Islamabad is the only city with fully functional shelters in buildings, with staff deputed there as well.

But Mr Ahmed said the capacity at the shelter is insufficient. “The capacity for charpoys should be increased by tens of times. There are thousands of people who cannot even afford charpoys available for just Rs60 a night,” he said.

Jehangira-native Umer Daraz, 65, has a handcart on which he carries people’s goods.

“I have been working as a labourer despite becoming a senior citizen,” he told Dawn. “It is good that the Panah Gah has been established, but I suggest the government also introduce some honorarium for the elderly.”

Mohammad Kamran, 35, has also been staying at the shelter. Mr Kamran is from Abbotabad and works as a labourer; the free meals and accommodation at the shelter mean that he is able to save some money.

Ghulam Naseem Khan, 56, who belongs to a village near Mianwali, has been staying at the shelter as well. Mr Khan said he was forcefully retired from the army in 1993 because a gun was recovered from his possession.

The following inquiry proved he had a licence for the pistol, based on which it was decided that he would receive two-thirds of his pension.

“I have been running from pillar to post since then, but no one has listened to my problem,” he said. “I am staying in Rawalpindi so that one day I might get someone in [General Headquarters] who would listen to my problem.” In the meantime, Mr Khan is working as a labourer.

The caretaker of the I-11 shelter, Rosh Dil Khan Hoti, said the shelter building was owned by Haji Allah Rakha - also known as Mukhtar Shah - who would distribute free meals in a street in I-10 in the early 1980s.

“Some of the residents complained to the district administration that the street would be blocked because of the distribution of food, so the district administration stopped him.

“Later the assistant commissioner, Chaudhry Mohammad Ali, forwarded a request to President Ziaul Haq to allocate land for the free distribution of food, and in 1986 a two and a half kanal plot was allocated for the Langar Khana in I-11. They used to give free curry and charge for naan; initially it was just a few paisas, and by last year it was Rs5 per naan,” Mr Hoti said.

“When Prime Minister Imran Khan directed to establish Panah Gahs, we held a camp at the fruit market giving away free food.

“The Langar Khana contacted us and asked her to move the Panah Gah there. We involved philanthropists and not only contracted the building but a number of other facilities, such as a dispensary, food and residence have also been provided there,” he said.

Chief Commissioner Amer Ali Ahmed visited the site every day and pushed the staff, because of which the two-storey building was finished in 20 days and other facilities, such as televisions and so on, were also provided, he added.

“We provide residence on a first-come-first-serve basis daily, and all the particulars and every person’s details are not only registered but also shared with the police. We cook here, a tandoor has also been established here, and we pay all the staff,” he said.

In response to a question, Mr Hoti said commodities such as flour and pulses are preferred to cash donations.

A senior district administration official, who asked not to be named, also told Dawn it has been decided to increase the number of charpoys to 400 and arrange food for 1,000 people.

He added that the dining hall will be moved to the basement, and another floor will be added to provide accommodation to up to 1,000 people in a few weeks.

",2019-01-13,"Revive Saarc: the message is clear, sensible and ought to be heeded.

The foreign minister of Nepal, Pradip Gyawali, has called on India to revive the Saarc heads of state summit, the last round of which was to be hosted by Pakistan in 2016 but was cancelled after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to travel to Pakistan and New Delhi leaned on other Saarc members to boycott the summit.

Meanwhile, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai has also added his voice to calls for the revival of Saarc and has spoken of the need for India and Pakistan to work together to reactivate the moribund organisation.

Mr Gyawali and Mr Karzai are right: Saarc needs to be revived and the multilateral forum should not be held hostage to bilateral tensions.

Indeed, Saarc could be a platform to address the very problems that India has wanted addressed by Pakistan, and Pakistan wants India to address.

It is striking that the smaller countries in Saarc are now openly recognising what has long been apparent: it is the countries of the region collectively that lose when dialogue and cooperation is suspended.

With a general election in India scheduled for later this year, there is a small window of opportunity before the Indian government goes into election mode and policy decisions are suspended.

There is no indication that Mr Modi and his government are seeking to reassess their approach to Pakistan ahead of a general election that could be closer than was expected until relatively recently.

But in seeking a second consecutive general election victory, Mr Modi and his team ought to recognise that the cycles of domestic politics and international relations are different and ought to be addressed separately.

Prime Minister Imran Khan and the military leadership in Pakistan have continued to express a desire for dialogue with India on mutually acceptable terms.

A generational shift may be imminent in Afghanistan and Pakistan and India could have pragmatic talks with Afghanistan on helping craft a stable and peaceful region.

India’s Kashmir policy has been disastrous and dialogue remains the only sensible path ahead.

Instead of blocking all avenues for dialogue, India should pay heed to what its regional friends and allies are telling it.

Revive Saarc, engage Pakistan, address regional security and economic issues, and move towards a more prosperous and peaceful region for all.

",2019-01-13,"In a session on ‘Muslim Women, Laws and Sexualities’, researcher Afia Zia and Fauzia Viqar spoke about the family laws and Muslim women with respect to socio-political order, secularism and feminism.

Viqar spoke about the challenges and obstacles that women in Pakistan faced within the law and in society.

Fauzia Viqar said there were three or four basic laws that guarantee women their rights in a family system, including the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (MFLO) formed in 1961, Dissolution of Marriage Act, the Child Custody Law and the Child Marriage Restraint Act, with amendments in 2017.

She said while these laws had made certain improvements there was a lot more left to do. She said the MFLO for the first time gave the right to divorce, the right to apply for khula (permission for divorce), and the right to refuse her husband another marriage.

Also read: Read this before you sign your nikah nama

She said it must be noted that the Christians, the Hindus and the Sikhs had their own marriage and divorce laws, although they too needed a lot of work on these to protect the women’s rights.

“We still see many problems arising from lack of implementation and the mindset starting from the judges down to the process servers,” she said.

She said the worst part was the discrimination between the ages of boys and girls in the Child Marriage Restraint Act where girls’ age is given as 16 years and boys’ age as 18 years.

“Whenever we speak about changing this, there seems to be an uproar as if we are going against the basic tenets of religion,” she said. “The same is the case with right to refuse polygamy. No one wants to accept this.”

Also read: A comprehensive list of things you can 'lightly beat' other than your wife

Ms Viqar also spoke of protection of women post divorce, and said that women must be given financial support after divorce. Women’s right in marital property should be divided equally too.

Meanwhile, Afia Zia, a feminist, researcher and author of ‘Faith and Feminism’ spoke about the women in Pakistan and how they had changed under every regime. She addressed the post-9/11 situation with regard to women movements in the Muslim context.

She said Gen Zia had politicised women’s sexuality and painted the image of immoral women as those who were open about themselves.

“Zina became an easy tool to control women with, and was used by the state, by society and by families and parents,” she said. “Four decades later women are still easy targets and are being used to further establish patriarchy in different ways.”

Also read: Like every other year, 2018 was the year of male rage

Speaking about women’s movements, Ms Zia said a prevailing notion was that there had been no rural movements, but she counted out the lady health workers’ movement that managed to regularise their positions, as well as raise their salaries across Pakistan, the Sindhyani tehreek (beginning from rural Sindh) and the women councillors’ and the hari movements.

“There is a difference of political positioning between women activists and feminists,” she added. “Feminists take on issues that impact more than just women. They speak of human rights essentially.”

In her book, Afiya Zia says that the Muslim women’s secular autonomy promises major transformation and effectively challenges Muslim male dominance.

In a session ‘Fog from London to Lahore’, Dr Christina Corton and Ahmed Rafay Alam spoke about the fog (now smog) that infected London back in the Victorian era while today Lahore was also suffering similarly.

In an interesting presentation, Dr Corton showed pictures, cartoons, and paintings by people who depicted the infamous London fog, sometimes even known as the London particular.

Rafay said Lahore was suffering the same way and only Saturday’s air quality readings were 163 (AQ) and PM 2.5, which was double the limit. He said people must speak out against it.

",2019-01-13,"Illustration by Abro

The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), once the most dominant political party in Karachi, is in complete disarray. At the moment there are three factions of the party vying for the Mohajir vote and at least two sub-factions within one of the splinter groups.

The immediate memory associated with the MQM in the minds of the party’s supporters is that of an organisation that was able to stall the political and economic alienation of Sindh’s Mohajirs. The other immediate memory of the party — mostly held by its detractors — is of an outfit which plunged Sindh’s capital, Karachi, into ethnic turmoil and of heinous crimes allegedly committed by the party’s armed wings.

There are also those who have maintained that the party was the outcome of ‘political engineering’ undertaken by the ‘agencies’ at the behest of Gen Zia’s dictatorship (1977-88). This has often been repeated by various political analysts. Even though this claim has never been convincingly substantiated, it is possible that this indeed was the case before the party broke away from the agencies’ orbit sometime in the late 1980s.

Was the MQM simply engineered by Gen Zia or was there more to its history?

This perception is largely rooted in comments by some Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) leaders and then those belonging to the PPP. In 1986, when one of the worst ethnic riots in Karachi propelled the MQM into the forefront, the JI claimed that the party had been created by the Zia dictatorship to neutralise the support the JI once enjoyed in Karachi. The PPP, on the other hand, claimed that the party had been engineered to “balance out the PPP’s influence in Sindh.”

There are various theories about MQM’s formation. But there is enough agreement among historians and analysts about the train of events which led to the formation of a Mohajir nationalist outfit. Dr Tanvir A. Tahir’s book Political Dynamics of Sindh traces the roots of this evolution all the way back to the 1950s when, according to Tahir, the Mohajir community began to feel it was being pushed out of the country’s ruling and economic elite. Tahir writes that the Mohajirs had become part of this elite immediately after Pakistan’s creation in 1947 when the Punjabis dominated the military and the Mohajirs were prominent in the bureaucracy.

After the assassination of Pakistan’s first prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan (a Mohajir), the Mohajirs began to feel that they were being nudged out. According to Tahir, the Mohajirs — who had come in droves from various parts of India and had mainly settled in Sindh — did not find the need to become familiar with the Sindhi culture because they became a majority in Karachi. Tahir also writes that this delayed the formation of a Sindhi middle class because the Mohajirs immediately managed to bag important positions in the province’s economy and government from Karachi that had become the country’s first capital.

In 1954, a Mohajir politician, Mahmud-ul-Haq Usmani demanded that Karachi be made a separate Mohajir-majority province. But the imposition of the One Unit system, that clubbed West Pakistan as a single province, somewhat placated the Mohajir community which was suspicious of provinces being based on ethnic considerations.

According to Tanvir, the Mohajirs found themselves almost completely ousted from the ruling circles during the Ayub Khan regime in the 1960s. They vehemently took part in the 1968 anti-Ayub movement. But when, after Ayub’s departure in 1969, Gen Yahya Khan agreed to do away with the One Unit, the Mohajir groups protested against Karachi becoming part of Sindh.

The February 23, 1969, edition of daily Dawn reported the formation of a Jeay Karachi Committee. It was mainly led by a faction of the left-wing National Students Federation (NSF-Kazmi). The Committee demanded the creation of a “Karachi sooba (province).” Another organisation, the Mohajir Mahaz (MM) came into being in late 1969. But MM could win just one Sindh provincial assembly seat during the 1970 election. Mohajir vote largely went to JI and Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Pakistan (JUP).

In 1972, when the PPP-led Sindh government declared Sindhi as the province’s official language, groups of Mohajir students formed the Muttahida Tulaba Mahaz Karachi (MTMK). They asked car owners to change their number plates to Urdu and also attacked English signboards. Riots broke out between the police and the MTMK in Karachi and between Mohajir and Sindhi youth elsewhere in Sindh.

Usmani, who had demanded Karachi to be made a separate province in 1954, had joined the left-wing National Awami Party (NAP). But he lost the election in 1970. During the 1972 riots, he formed the Urdu Qaumi Council. The July 15, 1972, edition of daily Jang quotes the Council members as saying that the organisation was launched to “inculcate in the minds of Mohajirs, scientific consciousness of their history and culture.” The Council also demanded that the state treat Mohajirs as a separate ethnic community as it does the Punjabis, Sindhis, Baloch and Pakhtuns. Two years later, in 1974, a Karachi Province Movement was launched but it fizzled out.

The Mohajirs of Karachi played a leading role in the 1977 movement against the Bhutto regime. In 1978, two Karachi University (KU) students, Altaf Hussain and Azeem Ahmad Tariq formed the All Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO). In his 2011 biography, My Life’s Journey, Hussain writes that Mohajir youth were exploited by JI and JUP against the Bhutto regime.

In 1981, APMSO became a member of the progressive student alliance, the United Students Movement (USM) at Karachi University (KU). Hussain writes that JI’s youth wing “expelled” APMSO from KU and the party began to establish offices in Mohajir mohallas (localities).

According to their 2011 essay for Berkeley Journal of Social Sciences, Ali Chandio, M. Ahmad and F. Naseem quote famous Sindhi scholar Ibrahim Joyo as saying that “Punjabi economic hegemony” increased immensely in Sindh during the dictatorship of Gen Zia. This situation had a negative impact on the interests of Karachi’s prominent (non-Punjabi) business communities. This concern saw some members of these communities form an organisation called the Maha Sindh (MS) in 1983.

It was an organisation set up to protect the economic interests of Karachi’s Memon, Sindhi and Mohajir businessmen and traders. Chandio, Ahmad and Naseem write that Maha Sindh encouraged the formation of a Karachi-based party. Many APMSO members were involved in the party’s activities. MS eventually became a Mohajir-dominated organisation, which then evolved into becoming the MQM in 1984.

",2019-01-13,"IN an interview with a Turkish television channel, Prime Minister Imran Khan completely sidestepped a question about the condition of Uighur Muslims in China’s western Xinjiang province. He admitted that he knew little about the issue, and, instead, preferred to focus on and highlight Chinese financial assistance and investment in Pakistan.

China is under stiff criticism for its alleged persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, especially Uighur Muslims. Freedom House’s 2018 country report on China classified it as ‘religiously-not-free’ on its freedom index. China is seriously concerned about this growing perception that hurts its efforts to promote a ‘soft image’ of China for a successful execution of its Belt and Road Initiative and other global commercial and strategic projects. Last week, China said that it welcomed UN officials to visit Xinjiang provided that they stay out of its internal affairs.

Pakistan usually avoids commenting on China’s internal affairs. But many Pakistani men, married to Chinese Uighur women, claim their spouses are being held in so-called re-education camps and are demanding their release. The issue has put Pakistan in a difficult position, mainly due to China’s huge investment in the country, as well as the extreme sensitivity of Chinese authorities to discussions on the subject.

Mystery continues to shroud the nature of the camps in Xinjiang.

Mystery continues to shroud China’s re-education camps, with authorities least interested in opening them up to independent observers. However, Chinese scholars claim that they are a part of the country’s countering violent extremism strategy, which was not built in isolation from rest of the world. They assert that China has designed its re-education strategy after carefully examining CVE approaches in practice in the West and Muslim world, which also employ similar community engagement programmes. Though they tend to justify their muscular approach by quoting examples from the Gulf, and South and Southeast Asian Muslim nations, the Chinese CVE strategy still appears highly politicised and opaque to Western practitioners and policymakers.

Much of the information about China’s re-education centres comes from West. Though the criticism has forced Chinese authorities to ‘release’ some information, it is insufficient to make a proper assessment. Last year, a state-run news agency published an interview of Shohrat Zakir, the Xinjiang governor, describing the camps as “professional vocational training institutions” for people influenced by terrorism and extremism who have not committed an offence warranting criminal punishment.

Similarly, in a seminar in China last November, local scholars explained China’s CVE approaches. Alluding to diverse and disparate CVE practices in different countries, they tended to conclude that no uniform or global CVE programme exists. One Chinese scholar presented a four-layered model based on the four principles of breaking, establishing, preventing and developing. ‘Breaking’ referred to isolating individuals from an extremist environment; ‘establishing’ meant introducing them to the true spiritual values of religion; ‘preventing’ was seen as educating; and ‘developing’ was interpreted as a skill development programme.

However, one of the best works available on the subject of China’s CVE strategy is by Zunyou Zhou, a Germany-based Chinese scholar. In a paper published in the Journal of Terrorism and Political Violence in 2017, he noted that the Chinese CVE strategy is based on multiple approaches and, interestingly, that they consulted Western CVE and deradicalisation approaches extensively and then built their own, more muscular model. The approaches include ‘five keys’, ‘four prongs’, ‘three contingents’, ‘two hands’ and ‘one rule’. Viewed together, these approaches point to legal, religious, cultural, ideological, and scientific aspects of the deradicalisation effort, implemented by governmental agencies, public institutions and non-governmental organisations in the region.

The Xinjiang government has developed several programmes to target different groups of people, including those who are ‘radicalised’ as well as those who are not but considered vulnerable to recruitment. The ‘five keys’ — ideological, cultural, customary, religious and legal — give a long-sustaining solution to terrorism. The ‘four prongs’ refer to a combination of four methods: ‘squeezing by correct faith’; ‘counteracting by culture’; ‘controlling by law’; and ‘popularising science’. ‘Squeezing by correct faith’ refers to clarifying people’s understanding of Islam while ‘counteracting by culture’ means seeking effective and practical solutions to thwart extremism and guiding people towards secularisation and modernisation. The ‘three contingents’ refer to the policy of reinforcing three main groups of people the government can count on to maintain stability and security. The ‘two hands’ refer to the one ‘firm hand’ that cracks down on terrorists, and the other ‘firm hand’ that educates and guides Uighur people, and the ‘one rule’ means the policy of ruling Xinjiang according to the law.

The author also provides historical background on the evolution of the Chinese CVE strategy and mentions that it materialised in a policy document entitled Several Guiding Opinions on Further Suppressing Illegal Religious Activities and Combating the Infiltration of Religious Extremism in Accordance with Law, issued by Xinjiang’s CCP Committee in May 2013. The policy document was also referred to as ‘No. 11 Document’, and described the borders between ethnic customs, normal religious practices and extremist manifestations.

For the CVE strategy’s smooth implementation, the Xinjiang authorities have introduced new legal regimes, and the latest amendment (titled ‘Regulation on Anti-Extremism’) was introduced in April 2017 to ban a wide range of extremist behaviours. Under the new legal framework, authorities have launched many programmes including deradicalisation for prisoners, and social programmes for those who have engaged in terrorism or extremism but do not deserve criminal punishment.

The re-education camps — or ‘rehabilitation centres’ — have been created as a part of China’s social programming. These centres run through civil society groups in Xinjiang or through ‘Fang Hui Ju’ working groups, dispatched by the regional government, comprising practitioners tasked with winning the hearts and minds of the people.

For CVE practitioners, the Chinese model may have a lot of substance to learn from. But the Uighur problem is more complex than religious extremism, as it has added dimensions of ethnic, cultural and political rights. For Pakistan, the Chinese CVE model offers nothing to learn from except to find a way of resolving the issue of Pakistani citizens’ spouses held in these camps.

",2019-01-13,"THE emperor walked beneath the beautiful canopy in the procession, and all the people in the street and in their windows said, “Goodness, the emperor’s new clothes are incomparable! What a beautiful train on his jacket. What a perfect fit!” No one wanted it to be noticed that he could see nothing, for then it would be said that he was unfit for his position or that he was stupid. None of the emperor’s clothes had ever before received such praise.

“But he doesn’t have anything on!” said a small child.

Pakistan’s most recent emperor problem is about to exit. The tales are many but they shall have to wait until after retirement — and perhaps never be told. After all, when one emperor exits, another tends to quickly appear. The system abhors a vacuum of would-be saviours.

They’ve all stood silent as the emperor passed by them with his new clothes on.

Who knows the rabbits the next one will have us chasing after.

But as we bid farewell to one and prepare for the arrival of the next, let’s turn to the starring role in the Hans Christian Andersen tale: the child who cried, “But he doesn’t have anything on!”

Where is the Pakistani version of that child?

Someone to say, no, this is wrong, you can’t do that. Stick to your job, stop interfering, stop pretending you know better, stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Stop trying to invent reality!

Or even a mild version of that.

Where is the person within the system willing to say no?

It can’t be that hard; it isn’t that hard. Especially within the court. An odious character showed the way recently, but for the wrong reasons and in a terrible way. But what happened to him? Stripped of his high-court judgeship, he’s been sent home.

That’s it. He lost his job and maybe his pension and probably a shot at one of those post-retirement sinecures that abound. For some that’s a lot to sacrifice and maybe even too much. But not for everyone.

And yet they’ve all stood silent as the emperor passed by them with his new clothes on.

It is possible that the more damage was caused by Iftikhar Chaudhry. He didn’t just think he was the messiah, he had proved that he was — who else can claim to have slain a dictator through mere defiance in a robe.

The worst thing about Chaudhry was that he was aware of what he had achieved and had an appreciation for the system — and his potentially limitless role within it. Chaudhry may have been mocked for trying to fix the price of sugar and excoriated for wading into the Steel Mills sale, but it was his eye for institutional and constitutional re-jigging that was truly dangerous.

Had it not been for the unavoidable judicial retirement age locked into the Constitution — who knows where we’d be today.

In contrast, the current occupant can seem tame. Flitting here and there, disrupting private and state business, it hasn’t really amounted to much. No prime ministers ousted — though maybe that was already done — no shockwaves through the system, nothing that can’t be patiently reversed.

But he could yet end up being worse because of something else: a willingness to break out of the judicial straitjacket and head for the orchestra pit itself, conducting an incoherent symphony.

Chaudhry is more famous, a trailblazer, as it were, but the incumbent has raised the populist bar. In theory, it’s easy enough for the successor to walk back: just don’t do what the predecessor has done.

But it may not be that easy.

First, you need a willingness to do so — to walk back some of the excesses and make the institution less of a lightning rod. But before the incumbent became the best known judge in the land, there was another.

To be overshadowed is a worrying place to start from.

Second, the judge headed for the exit has already taken the hit for being unconventional. The folksy, always-in-the-headlines, being-the-centre-of-everything model is already here and the public has been primed to accept and enjoy it.

Third, it is real power and leverage. Whimsical, arbitrary and fierce may be hard to make institutional sense of, but when you’re pounding the gavel and working the headlines, you are creating significant space for yourself within the system. Folk ignore your orders and ignore you at their peril.

All of which to say, more than ever we may need that child to cry, “But he doesn’t have anything on!”

It is depressing to think that there is no such man, woman or child here.

So maybe all we can do is remember how the Hans Christen Andersen fable The Emperor’s New Clothes ends:

“Good Lord, let us hear the voice of an innocent child!” said the father, and whispered to another what the child had said.

“A small child said that he doesn’t have anything on!”

Finally everyone was saying, “He doesn’t have anything on!”

The emperor shuddered, for he knew that they were right, but he thought, “The procession must go on!” He carried himself even more proudly, and the chamberlains walked along behind carrying the train that wasn’t there.

The End.

The procession must go on. The emperor has no clothes. There is no child here in this luckless land of ours to tell us the truth.

",2019-01-13,"LANDI KOTAL: The National Logistic Cell personnel thrashed immigration staff at Torkham border the other day for distributing stamped passports to the Afghan nationals without informing them, sources said.

They confided to Dawn on condition of anonymity that the NLC officials exchanged hot words with a staff member of immigration after he distributed stamped passports to Afghan nationals without informing them.

The sources said that the NLC had unilaterally taken upon itself the responsibility of seizing all the stamped passports from immigration staff after completion of necessary paperwork by the Federal Investigation Authority.

They said that the NLC personnel questioned the distribution of passports on Thursday to which the FIA staff objected as the former was not authorised to interfere in the official work of immigration. They said that the NLC personnel then entered the offices of FIA and hurled abuses at the immigration staff besides thrashing some of them who objected to their interference.

",2019-01-13,"PESHAWAR: An anti-terrorism court here on Saturday recorded the statement of Mohammad Iqbal during the trial of four of many people charged with lynching his son, Mashal Khan, in the Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, in 2017.

The accused, including Asad Katlang, Sabir Mayar, Arif Khan and Izharullah alias Johny, who were arrested after remaining at large for a long time, were indicted on Sept 11, 2018, for involvement in the killing of Mashal Khan.

The court, which has been conducting in-camera proceedings, fixed Jan 19 for the next hearing after summoning some other prosecution witnesses.

Mashal’s father, Mohammad Iqbal, is also a complainant in the case.

Barrister Amirullah Khan Chamkani, Shah Khattak and Fazal Khan represented Mohammad Iqbal in the case.

Mashal Khan, a 23-year-old student of the Department of Mass Communication at the AWKU, Mardan, was lynched by a mob over the blasphemy allegation on Apr 13, 2017.

On Feb 7, an anti-terrorism court had convicted 31 of the 57 accused in the lynching case, awarding death sentence to the prime accused, Imran Khan, life imprisonment to five of them and three-year imprisonment to 25 others.

However, the court, which conducted the trial inside the Haripur Central Prison, had acquitted 26 of the accused, observing that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them.

It had also declared the allegation of blasphemy against Mashal false.
