",2019-01-17,"A third-year MBBS student was found shot dead in his hostel room at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) in Sindh's Jamshoro district, officials said on Thursday.

The body of the 20-year-old student was found with a gunshot wound on his temple and a pistol in his right hand; it was subsequently shifted to Liaquat University Hospital's city branch for a post-mortem examination.

LUMHS Vice-Chancellor Dr Bikha Ram said the deceased student was alone in his room in the Ibn-e-Sina hostel. When his roommate — who had gone out to attend some programme — returned to the dorm, he found the room's door locked. He broke it open to find his roommate's body lying on the bed, the VC added.

Police reached the site of the incident and seized the weapon found at the scene.

Dr Ram said he has formed an inquiry committee comprising the hostel provost, director of student affairs, warden and the campus director to determine the circumstances that led to the student's death.

He said the incident was an ""apparent suicide"", but the cause of the death was yet to be determined.

According to the VC, the committee will also investigate how the deceased student had apparently managed to bring the gun to the hostel room. The incident has highlighted the need for some preventative measures to be taken by the hostel administration, Dr Ram said.

Jamshoro Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Tauqir Naeem said the death appeared to be a suicide ""on the face of it"", but added that the incident would be probed.

He said they had learnt that a brother of the deceased was battling cancer while another brother had previously died of the same disease.

Dr Ram also quoted the student's friends as saying that he (the deceased) remained depressed allegedly due to his brother's illness.

According to the VC, the young man had reportedly sent a text message to his roommate saying ""Aaj ki raat bari yadgar hogi (Tonight will be very memorable)"", but the roommate had not understood the meaning of the message at the time.",Mohammad Hussain Khan,"['thirdyear', 'mbbs', 'student', 'found', 'shot', 'dead', 'hostel', 'room', 'liaquat', 'university', 'medical', 'health', 'sciences', 'lumhs', 'sindh', 'jamshoro', 'district', 'officials', 'said', 'thursday', 'body', '20yearold', 'student', 'found', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'temple', 'pistol', 'right', 'hand', 'subsequently', 'shifted', 'liaquat', 'university', 'hospital', 'city', 'branch', 'postmortem', 'examination', 'lumhs', 'vicechancellor', 'dr', 'bikha', 'ram', 'said', 'deceased', 'student', 'alone', 'room', 'ibnesina', 'hostel', 'roommate', 'gone', 'attend', 'programme', 'returned', 'dorm', 'found', 'room', 'door', 'locked', 'broke', 'open', 'find', 'roommate', 'body', 'lying', 'bed', 'vc', 'added', 'police', 'reached', 'site', 'incident', 'seized', 'weapon', 'found', 'scene', 'dr', 'ram', 'said', 'formed', 'inquiry', 'committee', 'comprising', 'hostel', 'provost', 'director', 'student', 'affairs', 'warden', 'campus', 'director', 'determine', 'circumstances', 'led', 'student', 'death', 'said', 'incident', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'cause', 'death', 'yet', 'determined', 'according', 'vc', 'committee', 'also', 'investigate', 'deceased', 'student', 'apparently', 'managed', 'bring', 'gun', 'hostel', 'room', 'incident', 'highlighted', 'need', 'preventative', 'measures', 'taken', 'hostel', 'administration', 'dr', 'ram', 'said', 'jamshoro', 'senior', 'superintendent', 'police', 'ssp', 'tauqir', 'naeem', 'said', 'death', 'appeared', 'suicide', 'face', 'added', 'incident', 'would', 'probed', 'said', 'learnt', 'brother', 'deceased', 'battling', 'cancer', 'another', 'brother', 'previously', 'died', 'disease', 'dr', 'ram', 'also', 'quoted', 'student', 'friends', 'saying', 'deceased', 'remained', 'depressed', 'allegedly', 'due', 'brother', 'illness', 'according', 'vc', 'young', 'man', 'reportedly', 'sent', 'text', 'message', 'roommate', 'saying', 'aaj', 'ki', 'raat', 'bari', 'yadgar', 'hogi', 'tonight', 'memorable', 'roommate', 'understood', 'meaning', 'message', 'time']","['mbbs', 'student', 'found', 'dead', 'hostel', 'room', 'jamshoro', 'medical', 'university']"

",2019-01-17,"The federal cabinet has decided to remove the names of PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah from the Exit Control List (ECL), but refuses to excise them from a joint investigation team's (JIT) report on the fake accounts case, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Accountability Mirza Shahzad Akbar stated at an evening press conference on Thursday.

The decision was made in line with a Supreme Court order to the government to remove the two's names from the ECL and review the cabinet decision to place the names of more than 170 accused in the fake bank accounts case on its travel restrictions list.

The orders came in relation to a suo motu case concerning the delays surrounding a 2015 FIA probe into the laundering of billions of rupees via fake bank accounts.

The JIT investigating the case, formed by the apex court itself, had earlier recommended the placement of a total 172 people on the no-fly-list.

Several bigwigs, including former president Asif Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur, former president of Summit Bank Hussain Lawai and Omni Group's Anwar Majeed, have all been nominated in the case. Property tycoon Malik Riaz, his son-in-law Zain have also been included in the probe.

In its detailed verdict after reviewing reports, the court had ordered that the names of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Shah be removed from both the exit control list and the JIT's report.

The court had further ordered that the case be forwarded to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), and directed the anti-corruption watchdog to wrap up its investigation within two months.

Prime Minister Imran Khan, who chaired the cabinet meeting on Thursday, directed the interior ministry to remove Bilawal and Shah's names from the ECL with immediate effect.

Citing some confusions about the apex court's detailed verdict, Akbar told reporters on Thursday that as per the court's orders, the accountability watchdog can still recommend the placement of the names of the Sindh chief minister and the PPP head again on the ECL if it deems it warranted.

Akbar further noted that the Supreme Court's order had directed that the JIT continue to support NAB, and that the watchdog will file a reference without waiting for the apex court's orders [in case it finds sufficient legal grounds to do so]. He also added that the references will be filed in the accountability courts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

The new chief justice will appoint a monitoring judge to the case, he added.

Other developments

Iftikhar Durrani, special assistant to the prime minister on media, also addressed the presser. He said that the cabinet had also approved the placement of the development and non-development budget of the Capital Administration and Development Division under the interior ministry.

The cabinet further approved the auction of 20 ships of the Ministry for National Food Security. The cabinet also approved the appointment of retired Maj Gen Amir Azeem as chairman Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, and the appointment of Ali Raza Bhatta, a Grade 21 officer, as secretary of the Benazir Bhutto Income Support Programme.

The cabinet also approved a supplementary grant of Rs750 million for the National Accountability Bureau.

At the onset of the meeting, the prime minister asked two cabinet members, Ali Zaidi and Fawad Chaudhry, to leave the meeting as the Election Commission of Pakistan has suspended their membership of the National Assembly after they, along with 70 other MNAs, failed to submit details of their assets to the commission in time.

'No mini budget but economic reforms package'

Later, while talking to media, Durrani rejected the impression that the government was going to launch a mini budget on Jan 23, 2019. He also categorically denied reports that the government may increase the ratio of sales tax on Jan 23.

""No new tax is going to be introduced,"" he said, adding that the economic reforms package is aimed at enhancing ease of doing business and to provide some incentives to the business community.",Sanaullah Khan | Javed Hussain,"['federal', 'cabinet', 'decided', 'remove', 'names', 'ppp', 'chairperson', 'bilawal', 'bhuttozardari', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'murad', 'ali', 'shah', 'exit', 'control', 'list', 'ecl', 'refuses', 'excise', 'joint', 'investigation', 'team', 'jit', 'report', 'fake', 'accounts', 'case', 'special', 'assistant', 'prime', 'minister', 'accountability', 'mirza', 'shahzad', 'akbar', 'stated', 'evening', 'press', 'conference', 'thursday', 'decision', 'made', 'line', 'supreme', 'court', 'order', 'government', 'remove', 'two', 'names', 'ecl', 'review', 'cabinet', 'decision', 'place', 'names', '170', 'accused', 'fake', 'bank', 'accounts', 'case', 'travel', 'restrictions', 'list', 'orders', 'came', 'relation', 'suo', 'motu', 'case', 'concerning', 'delays', 'surrounding', '2015', 'fia', 'probe', 'laundering', 'billions', 'rupees', 'via', 'fake', 'bank', 'accounts', 'jit', 'investigating', 'case', 'formed', 'apex', 'court', 'earlier', 'recommended', 'placement', 'total', '172', 'people', 'noflylist', 'several', 'bigwigs', 'including', 'former', 'president', 'asif', 'zardari', 'sister', 'faryal', 'talpur', 'former', 'president', 'summit', 'bank', 'hussain', 'lawai', 'omni', 'group', 'anwar', 'majeed', 'nominated', 'case', 'property', 'tycoon', 'malik', 'riaz', 'soninlaw', 'zain', 'also', 'included', 'probe', 'detailed', 'verdict', 'reviewing', 'reports', 'court', 'ordered', 'names', 'bilawal', 'bhutto', 'zardari', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'murad', 'shah', 'removed', 'exit', 'control', 'list', 'jit', 'report', 'court', 'ordered', 'case', 'forwarded', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'nab', 'directed', 'anticorruption', 'watchdog', 'wrap', 'investigation', 'within', 'two', 'months', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'chaired', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'thursday', 'directed', 'interior', 'ministry', 'remove', 'bilawal', 'shah', 'names', 'ecl', 'immediate', 'effect', 'citing', 'confusions', 'apex', 'court', 'detailed', 'verdict', 'akbar', 'told', 'reporters', 'thursday', 'per', 'court', 'orders', 'accountability', 'watchdog', 'still', 'recommend', 'placement', 'names', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'ppp', 'head', 'ecl', 'deems', 'warranted', 'akbar', 'noted', 'supreme', 'court', 'order', 'directed', 'jit', 'continue', 'support', 'nab', 'watchdog', 'file', 'reference', 'without', 'waiting', 'apex', 'court', 'orders', 'case', 'finds', 'sufficient', 'legal', 'grounds', 'also', 'added', 'references', 'filed', 'accountability', 'courts', 'islamabad', 'rawalpindi', 'new', 'chief', 'justice', 'appoint', 'monitoring', 'judge', 'case', 'added', 'developments', 'iftikhar', 'durrani', 'special', 'assistant', 'prime', 'minister', 'media', 'also', 'addressed', 'presser', 'said', 'cabinet', 'also', 'approved', 'placement', 'development', 'nondevelopment', 'budget', 'capital', 'administration', 'development', 'division', 'interior', 'ministry', 'cabinet', 'approved', 'auction', '20', 'ships', 'ministry', 'national', 'food', 'security', 'cabinet', 'also', 'approved', 'appointment', 'retired', 'maj', 'gen', 'amir', 'azeem', 'chairman', 'pakistan', 'telecommunication', 'authority', 'appointment', 'ali', 'raza', 'bhatta', 'grade', '21', 'officer', 'secretary', 'benazir', 'bhutto', 'income', 'support', 'programme', 'cabinet', 'also', 'approved', 'supplementary', 'grant', 'rs750', 'million', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'onset', 'meeting', 'prime', 'minister', 'asked', 'two', 'cabinet', 'members', 'ali', 'zaidi', 'fawad', 'chaudhry', 'leave', 'meeting', 'election', 'commission', 'pakistan', 'suspended', 'membership', 'national', 'assembly', 'along', '70', 'mnas', 'failed', 'submit', 'details', 'assets', 'commission', 'time', 'mini', 'budget', 'economic', 'reforms', 'package', 'later', 'talking', 'media', 'durrani', 'rejected', 'impression', 'government', 'going', 'launch', 'mini', 'budget', 'jan', '23', '2019', 'also', 'categorically', 'denied', 'reports', 'government', 'may', 'increase', 'ratio', 'sales', 'tax', 'jan', '23', 'new', 'tax', 'going', 'introduced', 'said', 'adding', 'economic', 'reforms', 'package', 'aimed', 'enhancing', 'ease', 'business', 'provide', 'incentives', 'business', 'community']","['govt', 'decides', 'remove', 'names', 'bilawal', 'murad', 'ecl']"

",2019-01-17,"Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday telephoned Prime Minister Imran Khan to discuss the ongoing international efforts for peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan.

During the call, Ghani ""expressed his gratitude for Pakistan’s sincere facilitation of these efforts"" that were initiated by US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office said.

Khan assured the Afghan president that Pakistan was making ""sincere efforts for a negotiated settlement"" of the Afghan conflict through an inclusive peace process, ""as part of shared responsibility"".

Ghani invited the premier to visit Afghanistan at his earliest convenience and Khan reciprocated by inviting the Afghan president to visit Pakistan.

""Both leaders also agreed to remain engaged and create an environment for resolving all outstanding issues,"" the press release said.

The conversation between the two leaders comes as Khalilzad earlier today arrived in Pakistan as part of a regional tour to four countries for talks on the Afghan peace process.

According to the Foreign Office, the US special envoy is expected to meet Pakistan's civilian and military leaders during his stay and he will ask Pakistan to help convince the Afghan Taliban to come to the negotiating table. ""Pakistan has also maintained [that] we want an Afghan-led Afghan-owned solution to [the] imbroglio,"" the FO spokesperson said in a statement.

Pakistan is believed to be making serious efforts to arrange a meeting between Khalilzad and Afghan Taliban leaders in Islamabad to help break the deadlock and speed up the Afghan peace process, Dawn reported.

The US envoy is actively trying to broker a political solution to the Afghan conflict and has held multiple meetings with the leadership of Afghanistan as well as that of other countries in the region, including Pakistan.

",2019-01-17,"Complete address by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa on January 17, 2019 at the full court reference for Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar shared by the Supreme Court of Pakistan

Honourable Chief Justice and my brother Judges, Attorney-General for Pakistan, Vice-Chairman, Pakistan Bar Council, President, Supreme Court Bar Association, Members of the Bar, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen.

The Honourable Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar and I have been conjoined judicial twins for the last about twenty years and eight months.

In the medical jargon conjoined twins are twins whose bodies are connected to each other and it is through a very complicated surgical intervention that such twins may be separated. Mian Sahib and I were elevated to the Bench of the Lahore High Court together on May 21, 1998, we were deposed together on November 03, 2007, we were restored together on August 30, 2008 and we were elevated to the Bench of this Court together on February 18, 2010. In the High Court as well as in this Court our seniority has been next to each other’s and throughout this period of more than two decades we have sat on seats in the tea rooms of the Courts placed next to each other.

During all this while we have been physically together and I may, therefore, not be wrong in saying that we have been conjoined judicial twins.

Alas, by the stroke of midnight tonight these twins shall stand separated physically not through any surgical intervention but through a constitutional intervention and I must hasten to add that the loss through such separation shall be entirely mine. A sincere friend, a trusted confidant, a wise counsel and an accomplished and erudite Judge like Mian Sahib shall no longer be available on the Bench to help, advise and guide me.

The speakers before me have already spoken about how good a Judge Mian Sahib has been.

I can vouch for that and may add that I have served with more than a hundred Judges of the Lahore High Court and of this Court so far and I have found Mian Sahib’s mastery over civil, tax, revenue, service and constitutional law enviable and difficult to match. I have also served with a number of Chief Justices of the Lahore High Court and of this Court and I have no hesitation in acknowledging that Mian Sahib will go down in history as one of those Chief Justices who steered the Court quite ably in testing times.

The tenure of Mian Sahib as the Chief Justice of Pakistan fell in times which were turbulent, to say the least. The saga of the Panama Papers, the issues of constitutional disqualification of political leaders, the events leading to holding of the general elections in the country and the issues arising out of the national effort against terrorism, extremism, corruption and poor governance posed huge challenges but Mian Sahib was able to wade through all those troubled waters and to steer the ship of this Court to safe and still waters.

Despite his preoccupation with such larger national issues he also devoted his attention to many issues of public importance regarding the citizens’ fundamental rights. His keen interest in provision of clean drinking water in cities, removal of encroachments upon the State land, adequate medical facilities in hospitals, proper management of medical and legal education, supply of pure milk, recovery of written-off bank loans, proper investigation of mega corruption scams, population welfare, building of dams and water reservoirs, retirement of national debt and in some other areas of public importance has sensitised the governments and the populace at large on such vital issues. His efforts made towards police reforms are also likely to lead to an upturn in administration of justice.

Mian Sahib, your contributions in all these areas have left a mark and we shall always remember you with admiration and reverence.

Ladies and gentlemen,

As is customary, let us now have a peep into the near future.

With an experience of over two decades as a Judge and with the support of my colleagues also having vast experience I would, if Almighty Allah so wills, like to avail every moment of my remaining time on the Bench to attend to the causes that contribute towards delay in disposition of cases at all levels of the judicial hierarchy.

With an untiring effort of my colleagues having expertise on the criminal side we have already succeeded in deciding thousands of criminal cases and in wiping out the backlog of such cases in this Court and we are now left with only a few hundred pending criminal cases which can be termed as current cases. Such a target and success have seldom been achieved in any Court before and this has been possible in this Court only because the cause-list of the day was kept in control and there was a uniform policy of not entertaining or discouraging applications for adjournment. We understand that for a legal practitioner there cannot be an obligation or engagement more pressing or urgent than to appear before the Court when his or her case is fixed before the Court for hearing. We on the Bench greatly appreciate the cooperation extended to us by the learned counsel in this respect. An effort shall be made to extend and follow the same policy in all other categories of cases as well and we expect the learned counsel to extend similar cooperation to us even in those cases.

For facilitation of the learned counsel and in order to minimise the chances of adjournments modern technology shall be utilized and a possibility shall be explored regarding establishing video links between the Branch Registries of this Court and the Principal Seat through which the learned counsel may address arguments in the courtrooms of the Branch Registries and appropriate Benches of this Court may hear those arguments at the Principal Seat in real time and decide cases. Such innovation may reduce inconvenience and huge expense on the part of all concerned besides diminishing delays caused by non-availability of Benches at the Branch Registries of the Court.

The model courts set up in some of the Districts of the Punjab upon my initiative and under the patronage of Mian Sahib and supervision of Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah when his lordship was the Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court conducted and concluded trials of criminal as well as civil cases in three to four days rather than three to four years as was the case in the yesteryears.

With the approval and cooperation of the High Courts an all-out effort shall be made to expand the said project to the entire country. Even the steps taken towards judicially conducted arbitral interventions during criminal, civil and family litigation have yielded very positive results in the said Province and expansion of the said project shall also be explored seriously.

Mian Sahib had once observed publically that he is left with only two ambitions in life, i.e. to build dams and to retire the national debt. I would also like to build some dams, a dam against undue and unnecessary delays in judicial determination of cases, a dam against frivolous litigation and a dam against fake witnesses and false testimonies and would also try to retire a debt, the debt of pending cases which must be decided at the earliest possible.

I can anticipate that some of the steps to be taken in these areas may face some resistance or reluctance from those who are used to the old ways but I am sure that the results to be achieved will convince all concerned of utility and usefulness of such steps. I would like to assure you that all such steps will be taken in the best interests of the institution of judiciary and that in all manner of circumstances we shall like and prefer to be correct rather than erratic and proper rather than popular.

There are about 1.9 million cases pending in the country before all the courts put together and to handle such a huge number of cases there are only about 3000 Judges and Magistrates available from top to bottom.

Successive governments have failed to suitably increase the number of Judges and Magistrates on account of financial constraints.

3000 Judges and Magistrates cannot handle 1.9 million cases even if they work for 36 hours a day.

It is, therefore, time to take some big and hard decisions. It is also time to introduce some structural and systemic changes so as to minimize litigation, eliminate unnecessary delays and rationalize the workload. Time has also come when the judicial system as a whole needs to be redesigned or restructured and made simple and effective.

The four-tier judicial hierarchy in the country ought to be replaced with a three-tier system wherein there should be the District Judiciary as the trial court for all civil and criminal cases, the Provincial High Courts as the courts of appeal in all cases and the Supreme Court as the last resort.

All questions of fact must attain finality at the level of the High Court and the Supreme Court ought to attend only to interpretation of the Constitution and laws.

All the Special Courts ought to be abolished and there ought to be one hierarchy of courts with specified judges of the District Judiciary attending to cases under the special laws like drugs, banking, narcotics, corruption, terrorism, labour, intellectual property and consumer protection, etc. with appeals in such cases going to the High Courts. The special courts created under a Federal statute may be financed and administered by the Federal Government but they may fit into the same hierarchy. Having only one judicial hierarchy may eliminate jurisdictional disputes as well as the delay caused in resolving such disputes.

Military Courts trying civilians in criminal cases are universally perceived as an aberration propelled by necessity and expediency. If the legislature, in its own wisdom, decides to continue with such courts for the time being then it may consider providing for appeals from their decisions to lie before a High Court so as to adjust such courts in the normal judicial hierarchy and to ensure that expediency does not trump justice.

The already blurred distinction between Regular First Appeal, Regular Second Appeal, Revision petition and First Appeal against Order, etc. before the High Court ought to be done away with and in a three-tier judicial hierarchy a right of appeal may be provided against all orders or judgments of the trial court with a clear provision requiring the appeals against interim orders of the trial courts to be filed with an advance notice to the opposite party and such appeals may be finally decided within a few days.

Shorter formats of judgments and orders ought to be introduced so that time of the courts is not wasted in writing unnecessary details and, as far as possible, law clerks, research assistants and judgment writers may be provided to the judges at all levels so that their time may be saved in matters of research and drafting.

The constitutional jurisdiction of a High Court must be exercised within its prescribed limits and resort to it as a matter of course as the next available remedy has to be stopped or discouraged. For constitutional cases of national importance a Constitution Bench may be administratively carved out in this Court from within the strength of the Court keeping in view the seniority of the relevant Judges and reflecting the Federal character as far as practicable.

My colleagues and I would also want this Court to attend to many laws which are either unnecessary or their wrongful utilization is clogging the courts. It shall be suggested to the legislature that such unnecessary or problematic laws ought to be repealed or suitably amended and in case of failure of the legislature to attend to the said issue such laws may be judicially scrutinized. There are also some issues of public importance with reference to enforcement of fundamental rights of the citizens which have hitherto remained unattended and an effort shall be made to attend to those issues in all earnestness within the shortest possible time.

Suo motu exercise of this Court’s jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution shall be exercised very sparingly and only in respect of larger issues of national importance where either there is no other adequate or efficacious remedy available or the available constitutional or legal remedies are ineffective or are rendered incapacitated.

Either through a Full Court meeting or through a judicial exercise an effort shall be made to determine and lay down the scope and parameters of exercise of the original jurisdiction of this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution and, if deemed appropriate, to carve out the scope of an Intra-Court Appeal in such matters through an appropriate amendment of the Supreme Court Rules or to suitably amend the provisions relating to review jurisdiction so as to enlarge its scope in such cases.

I am conscious that the issues being faced by the justice sector are gigantic but I may assure you that no stone shall be left unturned in attending to such issues and in trying to improve the situation. With Baloch blood running in my veins I shall fight till the end and I am confident that with the support and cooperation of my colleagues and the Bar the struggle shall bear fruit.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let us admit that in the recent past there has been a trust deficit between different organs of the State and every organ has reasons for sticking to its declared position. There is no gainsaying that all the three organs of the State, i.e. the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive are always to strive hard for exercising their powers and performing their functions to the best of their abilities while maintaining their independence and operational autonomy but at the same time when it comes to steering the ship of the State and handling the larger national issues all such organs are to work in tandem in finding solutions which advance the spirit and purposes of the Constitution. The constitutional doctrine of separation of powers is sound and valid so far as the institutional and operational independence of every organ of the State is concerned but nothing in the said doctrine demands institutional isolation or forbids collective efforts to achieve common good. In my humble estimation time has come when we should put our heads together and in the spirit of truth and reconciliation discuss the larger issues jeopardizing good governance.

Let us discuss with open minds where the judiciary, the executive and the legislature have gone wrong in the past. Let us discuss where each other’s domain has been encroached upon in the past and try to resolve such issues through a mutually agreed course of action. Let us discuss the alleged encroachment of the executive domain by the judiciary through interference in matters of policy, the alleged excessive use of its constitutional jurisdiction in matters which are administrative in nature and how best the judiciary can return to its normal but effective adjudicatory role. Let us also discuss why the judiciary is struggling hard while trying to handle huge influx of cases and where the other organs of the State have so far failed to provide it the requisite support. Let us also discuss how the legislature can be restricted to its legislative domain and how the legislators can be held back to their legislative role rather than encroaching upon the executive domain through development funds and through interference in appointment, posting, transfer or promotion of public servants which is the main breeding ground for misuse of authority, corruption, lack of merit, inefficiency and the resultant bad governance. Let us discuss how the executive authorities and departments are to be kept operationally autonomous in administrative matters while implementing the policies of the political executive so as to ensure good governance. Let us also discuss, without mincing words or feeling shy, the role of the armed forces and the intelligence agencies in the governance paradigm. Civilian supremacy as well as civilian accountability are sine qua non for democratic sustainability. Let us deliberate how civilian supremacy can be ensured alongside civilian accountability without the process of accountability destabilizing democracy. And, let us not forget or fail to discuss the issue of missing persons and of enforced disappearances and their adverse impact upon the constitutional scheme of things as well as national cohesion. It needs to be realized and appreciated by all the stakeholders that statecraft is too serious a business to be reduced to a game of hide and seek and that in a constitutional democracy national security cannot be pursued by employing methods which are offensive to the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights to life and liberty. Instead of adopting a trigger-happy approach or a devil may care attitude on these delicate and sensitive issues we need to find solutions from within the Constitution and the law. Let us, therefore, sit together and discuss. Let us not keep drifting or floating aimlessly. Time has come to reflect upon the past, learn from the mistakes and to define the future course of action with clarity lest the rudderless ship may be swept away by the storm of unbridled emotions and selfish short-sightedness. Let us not shy away from all such critical issues or look the other way in careless abandon and let us catch the bull by its horns if we want to make any progress as a forward looking and democratic nation governed by a Constitution. Let us call a spade a spade, rise to the occasion and try to emulate our founding fathers in an effort to rebuild our nation on the foundations of freedom envisioned by our revered elders.

I would, therefore, with the approval and support of my colleagues, propose holding of an inter-institutional dialogue at the summit level and would request the worthy President of Pakistan to convene a meeting and to chair the deliberations. I am of the opinion that we have reached a stage in our national life where we must take stock of the mistakes committed in the past and to come up with a Charter of Governance so as to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in future. I would propose that such a summit may be attended by the top parliamentary leadership, the top judicial leadership and the top executive leadership including the military and the intelligence agencies. After bringing all such major stakeholders in the national governance on one table under the patronage of the President of Pakistan an effort should be made through such proposed exercise to heal the wounds of the past, attend to the sore points and work out a practicable policy framework whereunder every organ and institution of the State exercises its powers and performs its functions within its constitutionally defined limits. The sole purpose of the proposed exercise should be to bolster constitutionalism and rule of law, strengthen democracy and create an environment wherein the State and all its organs and institutions may be able to devote their wholehearted attention to the real issues of the citizens of this great country and, as envisaged in the Preamble to our Constitution, “So that the people of Pakistan may prosper and attain their rightful and honoured place amongst the nations of the World and make their full contribution towards international peace and progress and happiness of humanity”.

In the end, with fondest of memories and with every good wish I on my own behalf and also on behalf of all my colleagues bid farewell to our very dear friend, our illustrious colleague and our distinguished Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar. Sir, we shall all miss you on the Bench but at the same time all of us pray for your good health, long life and further fruitful contributions in diverse walks of life in the days to come.

May Almighty Allah bless you and your family.

",2019-01-17,"Over a period of more than 19 years, the judge has decided about 55,000 cases, including several high-profile ones.

Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, who will be sworn in as the 26th chief justice of Pakistan on Friday (January 18), was born on December 21, 1954 in Dera Ghazi Khan. He is married with two daughters and four grandchildren.

Justice Khosa's brothers are former bureaucrat Nasir Mahmood Khosa and former inspector general of police (IGP) of Balochistan Tariq Masood Khosa.

The judge, who is now 64 years old, received his undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Punjab and his LLM degree from Queens College at Cambridge in 1978.

Read: 'Suo motu notices to be taken sparingly,' says Justice Khosa

He enrolled as an advocate at the Lahore High Court in 1979, and then at the Supreme Court in 1985. As an advocate, he conducted over 600 cases. On February 18, 2010, Justice Khosa was elevated to the position of a Supreme Court judge.

Justice Khosa, over a period of more than 19-and-a-half years, has decided about 55,000 cases.

A special bench headed by Justice Khosa has decided over 10,000 cases of a criminal nature since 2014, according to an article published by The Express Tribune last year. “The total number of pending cases in the top court has reached near 40,000 and a few hundreds of criminal cases are left, which is being considered as a landmark achievement of the apex court,” the article read.

'Poetic justice'

Justice Khosa is known for adding lyrical flair in his observations and judgments — most recently in the landmark Panama papers verdict that de-seated Nawaz Sharif as the prime minister in 2017.

His dissenting note in the split 2:3 verdict — Khosa was among the two who held Nawaz should be disqualified — on April 20, 2017 began with a reference to the popular 1969 novel ‘The Godfather’ by Mario Puzo in which he pointed out an epigraph by Honore de Balzac selected by the author: ""Behind every great fortune there is a crime"", saying that ""It is ironical and a sheer coincidence that the present case revolves around that very sentence attributed to Balzac.""

The literary reference became a major talking point as opposition parties, in particular the PTI, latched onto it to drive home the allegations of corruption while PML-N spoke out against the choice of analogy.

Nawaz was subsequently disqualified under Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution in July the same year.

Read Khosa's article, written when he was a barrister, critical of the ambiguity inherent in Articles 62 and 63 here.

In 2012, when a SC bench — headed by headed by Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk — slapped former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani with a contempt charge, Justice Khosa authored an additional note along with the detailed judgement which included an original rendition of Khalil Gibran’s poem 'Pity the nation'.

Justice Khosa was also part of two high-profile blasphemy-related cases; he headed the bench which upheld the conviction of Mumtaz Qadri in 2015 for the murder of former Punjab governor Salman Taseer and last year in October, he was part of the bench that acquitted Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy charges.

Justice Khosa’s razor-sharp critique of the prosecution case is combined with remarkable judicial prose — lawyer Faisal Siddiqi

A column written by lawyer Faisal Siddiqi published in Dawn on the verdict in the Aasia Bibi case noted:

""Justice Khosa’s razor-sharp critique of the prosecution case is combined with remarkable judicial prose, when he appears to regret the imprisonment of Aasia Bibi by holding that 'Blasphemy is a serious offence but the insult of the appellant’s [Aasia Bibi’s] religion and religious sensibilities by the complainant party and then mixing truth with falsehood … was also not short of being blasphemous … in the circumstances of the present case she appears to be a person, in the words of Shakespeare’s King Lear, ‘more sinned against than sinning’.""

Next in line

Justice Khosa has authored multiple books during his career, including 'Heeding the Constitution', 'Constitutional Apologues', and 'Judging with Passion and Breaking New Ground'.

He also edited and compiled ‘The Constitution of Pakistan, 1973’ with all amendments up to date.

The next in line to take reins of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Justice Khosa has previously served as the acting chief justice from June 5-11 in 2017, June 29 to July 5 in 2017, May 14-30 in 2018, and Dec 17-23 in 2018.

",2019-01-17,"Prime Minister Imran Khan in a tweet on Thursday asked why lawmakers were ""so scared"" of the Exit Control List (ECL) and why they were so keen to go abroad.

The tweet comes ahead of a federal cabinet meeting today, in which the removal of the name of PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari — among others — from the ECL is expected to be discussed, DawnNewsTV reported. According to Radio Pakistan, the cabinet meeting will also discuss the overall political and economic situation of the country.

""There is so much work to be done by politicians in and for Pakistan — the land they claim to love but some cannot wait to take frequent trips abroad and lawmakers have iqamas or residences abroad,"" Prime Minister Khan added in his tweet.

""Can anyone explain this strange phenomenon to those of us who would be quite happy to remain in and work for Pakistan because we actually love Pakistan,"" the premier asked in another tweet.

Shortly after, Bilawal replied to the premier on Twitter, saying: ""Obviously selected PM doesn't understand the concept of human rights or freedom of movement.""

""Funny it’s only the opposition members on ECL, government members are busy travelling. Including PM who despite promising not to travel for first six months has made more than seven trips so far!,"" the PPP chairman added.

On the recommendations of the joint investigation team (JIT) tasked with probing the fake accounts case, the federal cabinet had in its meeting on December 27, 2018 decided to place the names of 172 individuals — who were named in the investigation report — on the ECL, including Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Faryal Talpur, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Farooq H Naek and several other leaders and provincial ministers belonging to the PPP.

Last week, Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar had grilled the state prosecutor over why the government had decided to place names of Bilawal and the Sindh chief minister on the no-fly list based on JIT's recommendation, ordering the federal cabinet to reconsider its ""hasty decision"".

The government, however, had said it would wait for the court's written judgement.

During a National Assembly session on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi regretted that the government had shown haste in placing the names of 172 people on the ECL.

Attempting to placate the PPP, Qureshi said that the matter was discussed in a federal cabinet meeting and the government had decided to wait until the detailed verdict is released.

According to Qureshi, the top court had ordered the government to consider the removal of the travel ban, not to take the names off the list immediately.

Later in the day on Wednesday, the Supreme Court finally released its order pertaining to the removal of the names of Bilawal as well as Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah from ECL, noting: ""Removing of the names will not prevent NAB [National Accountability Bureau] to probe and in case sufficient material is found connecting these individuals with cognisable offences, it will not be precluded from making an appropriate request to the federal government to place their names on [the] ECL again or take any appropriate action provided by law.""",dawn,"['prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'tweet', 'thursday', 'asked', 'lawmakers', 'scared', 'exit', 'control', 'list', 'ecl', 'keen', 'go', 'abroad', 'tweet', 'comes', 'ahead', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'today', 'removal', 'name', 'ppp', 'chairperson', 'bilawal', 'bhutto', 'zardari', 'among', 'others', 'ecl', 'expected', 'discussed', 'dawnnewstv', 'reported', 'according', 'radio', 'pakistan', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'also', 'discuss', 'overall', 'political', 'economic', 'situation', 'country', 'much', 'work', 'done', 'politicians', 'pakistan', 'land', 'claim', 'love', 'wait', 'take', 'frequent', 'trips', 'abroad', 'lawmakers', 'iqamas', 'residences', 'abroad', 'prime', 'minister', 'khan', 'added', 'tweet', 'anyone', 'explain', 'strange', 'phenomenon', 'us', 'would', 'quite', 'happy', 'remain', 'work', 'pakistan', 'actually', 'love', 'pakistan', 'premier', 'asked', 'another', 'tweet', 'shortly', 'bilawal', 'replied', 'premier', 'twitter', 'saying', 'obviously', 'selected', 'pm', 'nt', 'understand', 'concept', 'human', 'rights', 'freedom', 'movement', 'funny', 'opposition', 'members', 'ecl', 'government', 'members', 'busy', 'travelling', 'including', 'pm', 'despite', 'promising', 'travel', 'first', 'six', 'months', 'made', 'seven', 'trips', 'far', 'ppp', 'chairman', 'added', 'recommendations', 'joint', 'investigation', 'team', 'jit', 'tasked', 'probing', 'fake', 'accounts', 'case', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'december', '27', '2018', 'decided', 'place', 'names', '172', 'individuals', 'named', 'investigation', 'report', 'ecl', 'including', 'asif', 'ali', 'zardari', 'bilawal', 'bhuttozardari', 'faryal', 'talpur', 'chief', 'minister', 'murad', 'ali', 'shah', 'farooq', 'h', 'naek', 'several', 'leaders', 'provincial', 'ministers', 'belonging', 'ppp', 'last', 'week', 'chief', 'justice', 'pakistan', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'grilled', 'state', 'prosecutor', 'government', 'decided', 'place', 'names', 'bilawal', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'nofly', 'list', 'based', 'jit', 'recommendation', 'ordering', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'reconsider', 'hasty', 'decision', 'government', 'however', 'said', 'would', 'wait', 'court', 'written', 'judgement', 'national', 'assembly', 'session', 'wednesday', 'foreign', 'minister', 'shah', 'mahmood', 'qureshi', 'regretted', 'government', 'shown', 'haste', 'placing', 'names', '172', 'people', 'ecl', 'attempting', 'placate', 'ppp', 'qureshi', 'said', 'matter', 'discussed', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'government', 'decided', 'wait', 'detailed', 'verdict', 'released', 'according', 'qureshi', 'top', 'court', 'ordered', 'government', 'consider', 'removal', 'travel', 'ban', 'take', 'names', 'list', 'immediately', 'later', 'day', 'wednesday', 'supreme', 'court', 'finally', 'released', 'order', 'pertaining', 'removal', 'names', 'bilawal', 'well', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'murad', 'ali', 'shah', 'ecl', 'noting', 'removing', 'names', 'prevent', 'nab', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'probe', 'case', 'sufficient', 'material', 'found', 'connecting', 'individuals', 'cognisable', 'offences', 'precluded', 'making', 'appropriate', 'request', 'federal', 'government', 'place', 'names', 'ecl', 'take', 'appropriate', 'action', 'provided', 'law']","['prime', 'minister', 'khan', 'asks', 'lawmakers', 'scared', 'ecl']"

",2019-01-17,"A full court reference in honour of the retiring Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mian Saqib Nisar, was held in Court No. 1 of the Supreme Court on Thursday.

The ceremony in Islamabad was attended by all Supreme Court judges — with the exception of Justice Mansoor Ali Shah — as well as Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Anwar Mansoor, Vice Chairman of Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) Kamran Murtaza, retired senior judges as well as senior journalists, among others. Justice Nisar's family was also in attendance.

While addressing the gathering, Justice Nisar said the top court has passed many landmark verdicts. ""First is the Gilgit-Baltistan's verdict.""

""Supreme Court took notice of the scarcity of water in the country. The entire nation gave donations to solve the crisis. Second issue the court picked up was that of population growth,"" he said.

""[Judiciary] worked for the rights of the downtrodden, granted overseas Pakistanis the right to vote and gave every person the right to live with dignity. Court also took notice of private hospital charges, issuance of national identity cards by National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to transgenders.

""The court also took notice of Tayyaba torture case as well as the issue of children working as domestic servants.

""[I] tried to return the respect given by the people and tried to solve the issues plaguing sectors of health and education, both of which are rights granted to citizens by the Constitution.

""The role of a judge is never easy, I am aware that the decisions we make shape not just the day to day lives of individuals, but have the potential to mould the lives of generations to come.

""Fear has no place in a judge’s life, nor does the fear of opposition bring so much as a wrinkle on his forehead, for his only duty is to the Constitution and the people for whom he stands as a beacon of justice

""I worked within the code of conduct for judges and it has been my honour to have served the nation.""

The CJP thanked his fellow judges; ""those who have laid down their robes and those who grace the bench with me today, for always extending their unqualified support to me in all my efforts in dispensing justice and for working tirelessly round the clock"".

""I am also grateful to the employees of the Supreme Court and particularly each and every member of my staff, all of whom have invested long hours with me.

""I am highly indebted to my beautiful family [...] I would not be here today if it were not for you all.""

'Suo motu notices to be taken sparingly'

Addressing the full court reference, chief justice-designate Justice Asif Saeed Khosa said that he had been working alongside Justice Nisar for 20 years but will now have to part ways as per the law.

He said that the outgoing chief justice had faced many constitutional, societal and political challenges during his tenure and headed the judiciary in ""very difficult circumstances"".

Justice Nisar's services for humanitarian causes will be remembered, he added.

Read the full text of Justice Khosa's address here.

Outlining his plan for his upcoming tenure as top judge, Justice Khosa said that he will ensure the quick dispensation of justice.

Referring to Justice Nisar's efforts to raise donations to build the Diamer-Bhasha dams, Justice Khosa said that he too he wanted to build a dam.

""Mian Sahib had once observed publically that he is left with only two ambitions in life, i.e. to build dams and to retire the national debt.

""I would also like to build some dams, a dam against undue and unnecessary delays in judicial determination of cases, a dam against frivolous litigation and a dam against fake witnesses and false testimonies and would also try to retire a debt, the debt of pending cases which must be decided at the earliest possible.

""Currently there are 1.9 million cases pending in courts. Three thousand judges cannot dispense of so many cases,"" Justice Khosa noted.

""The power to take suo motu notices will be used sparingly,"" said the incoming CJP, ""and only in respect of larger issues of national importance where either there is no other adequate or efficacious remedy available or the available constitutional or legal remedies are ineffective or are rendered incapacitated"".

Speaking on the role of other courts, the SC judge said: ""The trial of a civilian in a military court is considered wrong across the world. It is said that military courts take less time to issue verdicts. Civilian courts should try to resolve cases in a short period of time. High courts should exercise powers within their jurisdiction.""

""When has the judiciary interfered in the matters of other institutions?"" Justice Khosa asked. ""Army and intelligence agencies should not interfere in civilian matters.""

""The job of the parliament is to legislate, not provide development funds. Transfers and postings are not among the parliament's duties either.""

PBC's Vice Chairman Murtaza, while speaking at the ceremony, said that Justice Nisar had availed the authority granted to judiciary under Article 184(3) (Original jurisdiction of Supreme Court). Murtaza said that while he was one of the opponents of Article 184(3), he had no doubts about the intentions of Justice Nisar. However, Murtaza said, the ""matter of Article 184(3)'s limitations must be resolved"".

Murtaza lauded Justice Nisar's ""extraordinary"" service as chief justice and wondered if the Supreme Court, as an institution, would be able to continue performing in a similar manner. He stressed the need for the introduction of institutional reforms.

""Chief Justice Saqib Nisar is a very capable person,"" Murtaza declared.

President of Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Amanullah Kanrani also addressed the ceremony and said that recently ""the judges' tone has become so harsh that it distracts the court and lawyers from their basic purpose"".

""Lawyers are not given a chance to present facts and arguments,"" he said. He further said that the ""huge amount of suo motu cases"" leads to a delay in the proceedings of other petitions. Kanrani also suggested that the appellants be allowed to appeal against the verdicts passed in suo motu cases.

The SCBA president also said that ""informal remarks"" passed by judges and lawyers during court proceedings affect the ""minds of petitioners"". Kanrani insisted that there was a need to hold judges accountable.

Justice Nisar's legacy

Justice Nisar was sworn in as the top judge on Dec 31, 2016. After he hangs up his robes today, Justice Khosa will take over the reins of the Supreme Court of Pakistan tomorrow when he will be administered the oath by President Arif Alvi.

Earlier in the day, after adjourning a hearing of his last case, Justice Nisar said he was ""thankful to everyone"".

""I spent more than 20 years in judiciary. I always tried to issue verdicts in accordance with the law and regulations,"" he said.

Among Justice Nisar's retirement plans are to open a ""free legal clinic"". ""I will offer free legal assistance to the oppressed, poor and helpless people at my free legal clinic,"" he had disclosed, stressing that the country belongs to the disadvantaged populace as much as it does to those from the more privileged sections of society.

Herald's 'Person of the Year 2018': Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, for judging too much

The outgoing chief justice passed several landmark judgements during his tenure as top judge — including the verdict in the Aasia Bibi case last year. He also headed the bench which decided that disqualification handed down under Article 62 (1)(f) of the Constitution would be for life.

The defining feature of his tenure, however, may be his judicial activism and frequent suo motu notices. Justice Nisar created headlines not just in the courtrooms, but by visits all over the country — to hospitals, filtration plants, lower court rooms and even prisons. Everywhere that the chief justice went, the cameras followed.

He also set up a fund for the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and initiated a campaign to raise awareness about population control.

At the full court reference that was held for his predecessor, former chief justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali, Justice Nisar in his address — which many believed was an insight into his plan of action as top judge — had declared that the judiciary will not tolerate corruption in any form.

Take a look: In search of a legacy

“The act of corruption by state actors is a complete fraud on the exercise of their power may it be the executive or judicial limbs of the state,” Justice Nisar had observed and cautioned that it should be very clearly understood that besides cleaning ‘‘our own house of corruption, the judiciary would play its role in the eradication of corruption from other limbs of the government’’.

Justice Nisar's judicial career

Justice Nisar has been a judge of the apex court since Feb 18, 2010. Before that he was a judge of the Lahore High Court (LHC).

Before being appointed as a judge, he was member of the Supreme Court Bar Associa­tion and Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA). He was elected as secretary general of the LHCBA in 1991.

Born on Jan 18, 1954, in Lahore, Justice Nisar did his matriculation from the Cath­edral High School, Lahore, graduation from the Gover­n­ment College, Lahore, and bac­h­elor of law from the Uni­versity of Punjab in 1979-80.

He joined the legal profession as an advocate on May 2, 1980. He was enrolled as an advocate of the high court in 1982 and advocate of the Supreme Court in 1994.

He was elevated as the judge of the high court on May 22, 1998, and of the Supreme Court on Feb 18, 2010.

Justice Nisar specialised in civil, commercial, tax and constitutional laws and appeared in a large number of important constitutional cases both in the LHC and the Supreme Court.

He was appointed as the federal law secretary on March 29, 1997, when he became the first member of the bar to be appointed to the important position.

Justice Nisar represented Pakistan in an international conference held at the Wilton Park, United Kingdom, on the subject of “Pakistan and India at Fifty”.

He led a Pakistani delegation to a conference in Manila on the subject of “Asia Region Transitional Crimes”. He also attended conferences in Switzerland and Norway.

He had also been a part-time lecturer at the Punjab Law College and Pakistan College of Law, where he taught civil procedure code and the Constitution.",dawn | Haseeb Bhatti,"['full', 'court',

10,https://www.dawn.com/news/1458103/pakistanis-have-given-me-so-much-love-says-indian-actress-aditi-singh,"Pakistanis have given me so much love, says Indian actress Aditi Singh
",2019-01-17,"“I don’t feel like I’m in another country. Pakistanis have given me so much love. I’m overwhelmed. I feel very lucky.”

This is how Indian actress Aditi Singh expressed herself at a press meet held at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday evening.

Ms Singh, who has worked in Pakistani film Wajood directed by Javed Sheikh, said she feels fortunate to have been asked to come to the press club. She was also happy that Pakistani actress Meera had accompanied her to the presser. Meera was the one who, when she first saw her in Wajood, had remarked that Javed Sheikh had cast a doll-like girl in his film.

Ms Singh said whatever she has achieved as an actress so far is because of the media and the way it has encouraged her presence in Pakistan. “Artists are nothing without the media’s support.”

Cast of Wajood.

Ms Singh told journalists that her maternal uncle, actor Aditya Pancholi, had told her that she would get a lot of love from Pakistan just as he did. It’s true. She has not yet felt that she’s not in her own house [country]. She is overwhelmed by the love that Pakistanis have given her. There are so many families here who have made her a member of their households.

Answering a question whether there are any technical differences between working in Indian and Pakistani films, she replied there’s none. The Pakistani industry is growing a lot, though the pace is slow. Pakistani media’s future is bright. The content being used here is of high quality. Responding to a query, she said she’d like to work with Pakistani artists Ali Zafar, Hamza Ali Abbasi and Meera.

Ms Singh began her film career with a Telugu film Guppedanth Prem and went on to do another Telugu movie Nenu Kidnap Iyanu before coming to Pakistan.

Prior to her address, Meera read out a speech (though earlier journalists were told that she’s going to play a recorded message because she wasn’t feeling well). She welcomed Ms Singh to the club and thanked the Pakistan Film TV Journalists Association for arranging the event.

Ms Meera said the club had gathered ambassadors of two countries under one roof. Though the countries had different borders, their people love each other. Borders could be far from each other but not the hearts of the people. There are a number of political and ideological differences between India and Pakistan, but when it comes to culture and the film industry, art is not confined to borders. Heads of state require formal invitations to visit one another’s countries, not the artist community. Artists cannot be stopped by foreign policy to cross into another country. The only thing that artists look for is love.

Ms Meera said she recently met Indian actor Sonu Sood in Dubai. He expressed his desire to come to Pakistan and wished that Meera’s upcoming film Baji is released in India. She also met Poonam Dhillon, who too wants to visit Pakistan.

The office bearers (Imtiaz Faran, Arman Sabir, Raja Kamran) and some members of the governing body of the Karachi Press Club formally welcomed the two guests. Wasi Qureshi conducted the programme.

11,https://www.dawn.com/news/1458101/khizar-hayats-case-should-serve-as-an-opportunity-for-introspection-for-the-government,"Khizar Hayat's case should serve as an opportunity for introspection for the government
",2019-01-17,"KHIZAR Hayat did not know how close he came to death this past weekend. It’s not as if nobody told him. He just cannot understand what an execution is.

In fact, even though he has been on death row since 2003, he does not know why he is in jail. The anti-psychotic medication he has been on has proven to be less and less effective with each passing year. Solitary confinement has only made his condition worse.

On Friday, Jan 11, the government of Pakistan issued Khizar’s execution warrant. He would be executed before sunrise on Jan 15. His mother, Iqbal Bano, was inconsolable. This is, unfortunately, not the first time Iqbal Bano has been dragged through this ordeal. Khizar was issued two execution warrants in 2015, one in 2017, and was about to earn the macabre status of being Pakistan’s first execution of 2019.

The Imdad Ali case: Why executing a mental patient is severely problematic

Every single one of those execution orders directly contravenes Pakistan’s international human rights obligations, domestic laws and expert medical opinion.

So why do they keep getting issued?

On death row since 2003, Khizar does not know why he is in jail.

In April 2016, before he was chief justice, Justice Saqib Nisar told a room full of psychiatrists that the laws must be tightened to protect the mentally ill.

But in the same year, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of Imdad Ali, another death-row prisoner with a severe mental disability on the premise that schizophrenia is “not a mental illness”. Criticism stemming from the public’s more straightforward conception of mental illness saved Imdad’s life at the eleventh hour.

In May 2017, Justice Umar Ata Bandial also stated at a conference that it would “be unfair to punish the mentally ill”.

These were encouraging indicators that perhaps, finally, it was being recognised that mentally ill defendants lack the criminal intent to warrant the same punishment as the mentally able.

In April 2018, Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, while hearing the cases of Kanizan Bibi and Imdad Ali, made headlines across Pakistan by categorically ruling out execution for prisoners with mental disabilities. “Beyond sense or reason,” he rightly declared in open court, “that we hang the mentally ill.” He immediately ordered that Kanizan be transferred to a secure mental health facility to get the treatment she needs. Fresh medical reviews have been ordered for both, and the case has been dubbed “precedent-setting” for the rights of the mentally disabled.

While these two cases remain pending before the Supreme Court, in December 2018, the Lahore High Court dismissed a petition seeking Khizar’s transfer to a mental health facility. It stated that “emotional disorders of like nature were not viewed as factors sufficient enough to impede execution”. Not only did this clear the pathway to Khizar’s execution but also exposed demonstrably mentally ill prisoners like Kanizan, Imdad and Saleem to the same fate.

Luckily, the National Commission on Human Rights was quick to act. It issued an order restraining the relevant authorities from scheduling Khizar’s hanging until the matter is decided by the Supreme Court. Jail authorities were not only copied in the order that was issued, they were also present at the hearing. They were party to the statements. They cannot claim ignorance.

The government of Pakistan should use this case as an opportunity for introspection. When the jury was, quite literally, still out on the matter of mentally ill prisoners — how could the lower courts so openly disregard the Supreme Court? How were the orders of the Pakistani government’s foremost human rights body defied so blatantly by jail authorities?

This breakdown of communications can prove to be deadly. Had the campaign mobilised by Justice Project Pakistan not caught the attention of the chief justice, had voices of influence not been moved enough to amplify their platforms and privilege, had the deluge of appeals to the president to accept his appeal for clemency stemmed, Khizar would have been a dead man by now.

Every prisoner with a history of mental illness should have their sentences commuted without delay. This is the very least that Pakistan’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights demand.

President Arif Alvi has Khizar’s mercy petition before him. It contains details of his mental illness, the laws that confirm that his execution would be wrongful, as well as a reminder of Pakistan’s international commitments. It makes for a useful and life-saving document.

The right to seek pardon belongs to the people. It is not just a private act of grace but a meaningful safeguard against any mistakes that might have been made during sentencing. And in Khizar’s case, it is exactly what justice looks like.

",2019-01-17,"GILGIT: Senator Talha Mahmood claimed to set a record by hunting an ibex with 54 inches horns in Passu valley of Hunza district here on Tuesday.

The lawmaker, who was accompanied by a local guide in the expedition, told reporters that Gilgit-Baltistan had the largest wildlife habitat in Asia and therefore, it could attract foreigners in large numbers for lawful hunting.

The wildlife department officials said Senator Talha had obtained the trophy hunting licence by paying the permit fee to the GB government for hunting ibex.

They said the lawmaker had been hunting animals in GB for the five years.

GB conservator (wildlife and parks) Yaqoob Ali Khan said more than 40 wildlife species had so far been hunted in the region under the 2018-19 trophy hunting programme.

He said people from within the country and the US and Europe got hunting permits.

The official said the wildlife department had auctioned the hunting licence in Oct last year under the 2018-19 trophy hunting programme.

He said the wildlife department was doing its best to check illegal hunting across the region despite being short staffed.

Meanwhile, the police arrested a man for illegally hunting an ibex in Passu valley of Hunza.

",2019-01-17,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday decided to immediately recruit 15,000 employees, including 6,000 police constables and officers, in seven merged districts of the province previously known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

The decision was made during a high-level meeting held here with Governor Shah Farman in the chair.

Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, adviser to the prime minister on establishment Mohammad Shahzad Arbab, provincial ministers and senior officers also attended the meeting.

Minister says govt wants local body polls held in erstwhile Fata before PA’s

Information minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai later told reporters that around 30,000 posts of different departments and attached directorates had been lying vacant in seven merged districts.

He said it had been decided to fill 15,000 posts, including 6,000 for police personnel.

The minister said priority for those jobs would be given to local residents. He said officers of the police would also be deployed in seven merged districts to perform their duties along with Levies and Khasadar.

Mr Yousafzai said all relevant departments had been directed to expedite development activities in different sectors, while the timeline of three months had been set for the execution of all schemes to ensure early implementation of projects.

He said the departments and directorates would inform the relevant authorities about vacant posts so that they could be filled within the stipulated period.

The minister said process for holding local government elections in the region was also discussed.

He said the government wanted to hold the local body elections in seven tribal districts before elections for the KP Assembly there.

Mr Yousafzai said the delimitation process had been completed and that the government would ask the Election Commission of Pakistan to announce date for local government polls in the area.

He said the relevant department had been directed to install solar panels in 300 mosques of the region within three months.

The minister said 16 grid stations would be upgraded, while work on 10MW hydel power generation unit in Kurram district would begin very soon.

He said municipal services would be extended to 25 tehsils by March 31.

Mr Yousafzai said the government had accorded top priority to the development of education and health sectors with missing facilities being provided to educational institutions and health centres.

Advisor to the chief minister on education Ziaullah Bangash said budget for the education sector totaled Rs18 billion, including Rs4 billion for the development side.

He said the board of governors for the governor’s model schools would be changed with the immediate priority of the department being the resolution of the issue of attendance in schools.

Mr Bangash said the directorate of education for seven tribal districts had been merged with the province, while the independent monitoring units had begun working in the region to find out missing facilities in schools besides ensuring presence of teachers on duty.

The information minister said the facility of Sehat Insaf Card would be extended to all tribal districts with half of the million families getting cards.

He said the distribution of those cards would begin on Jan 31.

Mr Yousafzai said the hospital administrations had been directed to ensure the provision of emergency medicines in all tribal districts so that the people couldn’t face any problem in getting treatment.

He said the Sports Gala would be organised in tribal districts in Feb, while cultural festivals would be held there in the same month.

",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: After being censured by the Supreme Court (SC) the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has taken over possession of 237 kanals from locals of Chattha Bakhtawar for the construction of the King Hamad Nursing University.

CDA had acquired over 900 kanals in Chattha Bakhtawar in 1981 but there was a dispute between locals and the civic agency regarding the compensation amount.

Due to this dispute, the civic agency was unable to get possession of the land. But some years ago, when King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain had announced funding for a nursing university, the CDA had allotted 237 kanals to the health ministry for the construction of the varsity even though it did not have possession of the said land.

Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had in Jan 2017 laid the foundation stone of the university but construction work could not be started due to the compensation dispute.

SC had recently reprimanded CDA officers for the civic agency’s failure in taking possession of the land and made directions that it should ensure possession.

The civic agency on Wednesday conducted an operation and handed over the land to the health ministry after getting possession. The health ministry will start construction work in collaboration with the government of Bahrain.

CDA spokesperson Syed Safdar Ali said that 15 built-up-properties (BUP) were demolished during the operation and that 17 families were given allotment letters for alternative plots in compensation for their demolished BUPs.

He said CDA had also made arrangements to pay compensation on the spot and that cheques were distributed among the people from whom the land was acquired.

“The process was completed amicably and with no untoward incident,” he said, adding that after vacation, the land was handed over to the concerned department.

A camp office has been established at the site for the facilitation of locals whose land has been acquired.

Sources said that CDA had decided to give an 8pc increase in the rate of land per annum from the date of the award announced in 1981 to get possession of the over 900 kanals.

The sources also said that according to the CDA Ordinance of 1960, the civic agency could not give an 8pc increase as it did not get possession of the land.

Clause 32-A of the 1960 ordinance says, “Payment of additional compensation: When the amount of the compensation determined under section 29 and sub section (3) of section 30 is not paid or deposited with the deputy commissioner shall, in addition to such compensation, pay additional compensation computed at the rate of eight per centum per annum on such compensation from the time of so taking the possession until it has been so paid or deposited”.

However, sources said the step was taken as it would have been unfair to compensate locals in 2019 at the rate in vogue in 1981.

CDA Deputy Commissioner Qazi Shoaib said cases related to the Chatta Bakhtawar award had been in litigation in various courts for years.

“So we decided to amicably resolve it,” he said, and that an 8pc per annum amount is justified with the current market rate.

The land award was announced in 1981 but after 35 years, the CDA announced a controversial BUP award in 2016, saying that 782 people were eligible for an initial BUP award.

The National Accountability Bureau is currently conducting an investigation into bogus BUP awards.

15,https://www.dawn.com/news/1458002/pac-subcommittee-decides-in-principle-on-forensic-audit-of-iia-project,"PAC subcommittee decides in principle on forensic audit of IIA project
",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: With the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) saying it needs six months to determine the law under which to file a reference, a subcommittee of the Public Accounts Committee has decided in principle to carry out a forensic audit of the Islamabad International Airport.

The subcommittee, which is led by PTI MNA Syed Fakhar Imam, has also directed the auditor general to determine whether delays in the project were caused by the contractor or the government.

The audit department has said it is quite capable of carrying out the audit as it is already auditing a private firm on Supreme Court orders, but would officially consent after a week.

NAB tells subcommittee it needs six months to determine the law under which to file a reference

While discussing delays in the escalation in cost for the airport from Rs37 billion to Rs105bn, the subcommittee was informed that the PAC has already referred some audit objections to NAB. However, a NAB official said the bureau would need six months to determine under which law it should file its reference, for which it will also consult with law experts at universities.

PML-N MNA Rana Tanveer Hussain said the six month wait would be too long, adding: “When you want to file references or take action against politicians you don’t even take a month to do it.”

Pakistan Engineering Council Chairman Jawed Salim Qureshi intervened in the discussion and said that in other countries, forensic audits are used to fix responsibility in such cases.

He added that here, government departments “ try to accept responsibility to protect the contractor from fines”.

Forensic audits investigate why a project was delayed and who was responsible, he said, adding: “It is inquired from the government department if it asked the contractor why the project was delayed and what the contractor’s reply was.”

Mr Qureshi also alleged that the project cost was deliberately stated to be Rs37bn instead of Rs81bn so “small and incompetent companies would be able to win the contract”.

Audit Works (Federal)Director General Mohammad Azhar told the subcommittee earlier that four inquiries have been conducted over delays in the completion of the airport.

“The ground-breaking of the project was held on April 7, 2007, and the project had to be completed within 30 months. However, at the time of the ground-breaking ceremony, the design of the project was not ready and even the PC-I was not approved. Even after 18 months, work on the runway was done again as work done at the time of the ground-breaking was destroyed,” he said.

Mr Azhar said that while the initial cost of the project was Rs37bn, a Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) report had revealed that a number of components were not included in the project. The realistic cost of the project, he said, was Rs81bn.

“However even that price escalated and reached over Rs105bn. We have raised a number of objections and even the FIA report shows that our objections were correct,” he said.

An Aviation Division official attributed the increase in cost to the decision to upgrade technology, and the foreign exchange conversion rate.

The official said the SC took note of the issue in September 2013, after which retired Lt Gen Shahid Nawaz carried out an inquiry and a review committee, headed by Shamsul Mulk, also looked into the matter.

The IIA project was conceived of in 1984, and the procurement of land near Fateh Jang began the same year. Land was bought for Rs30,000 per kanal to Rs500,000 per kanal, averaging Rs70,000 per kanal.

A stone-laying ceremony was held in 2004, and construction began without the approval of any design. Construction projects were also awarded at the same time to 17 contractors.

The initial Rs37bn PC-I was approved in 2008, which did not include the fuel system, radar and radio control building, aprons for planes, sewerage treatment plant, electricity or the availability of water.

In order to resolve the issue of water availability, it was decided to build two dams – Ramma and Kassana – at a cost of approximately Rs1.7bn to provide 3.3 million gallons of water per day.

",2019-01-17,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, have denied reports of an alleged raid on the house of Sorath Lohar, convener of the Voice for Missing Persons of Sindh (VMPS).

In a statement, the paramilitary force called them attempts to defame the Rangers’ personnel, propagating fake news of raiding Lohar’s house and arresting her brother Singhar Lohar.

It was alleged that a Rangers’ team raided her house and took away her 17-year-old brother. Soon after the alleged raid, a number of civil society and nationalist activists held a protest demonstration at Shaheed Chowk in Khipro town of Sanghar district.

The statement, however, added that VMPS representatives uploaded a “fake” video of the alleged raid on social media platforms on Jan 12, while the news also appeared on Jan 15. The paramilitary force said that the Rangers did not carry out any raid on Lohar’s residence nor did any personnel harass her family.

As for the video circulated on social media, the Rangers said the mobile van seen in the footage was dispatched to Shumail Complex, near Mausamiyat [Karachi], on Jan 12 to arrest a suspect named Khalid Zaman.

",2019-01-17,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has urged the Sindh police to keep strict vigilance on peddling of narcotics in educational institutions.

“This is a serious matter and must be handled seriously,” he said and added that whenever he met parents they urged him to take strict action against peddling of narcotics in educational institutions.

“I am quite concerned about our children, who are the future of Pakistan and we have to bring them up in a safe, secure and healthy atmosphere,” he said.

He also directed the education secretary to develop coordination between private educational institution administrations and the police and also involve parents in the matter, if necessary, to develop a mechanism to stop narcotics peddling in educational institutions.

‘Most private security guards are untrained, which is dangerous’

The chief minister, presiding over a weekly meeting on law and order here at the CM House on Wednesday, also directed the home secretary to issue instructions to all security companies to get verification of their guards.

“I want security audit of all the guards employed by security agencies,” he said and added that apart from verification of their personnel, their weapons must be inspected.

“I have noticed that most of the private security guards are untrained which is dangerous,” he said and highlighted the need for making police training centres more professional for the training of new recruits and in-service training.

He also referred to two upcoming important events — PSL and multinational ‘Naval AMAN’ exercise — where the police had to provide security, therefore necessary meetings with the quarters concerned must be organised.

Operation against drug mafia

Earlier, DIG South Sharjeel Kharal told the chief minister that he had arrested a key suspect involved in developing a group to smuggle narcotics into educational institutions. IGP Kaleem Imam said that on the instructions of the chief minister the police had already launched a targeted operation against the drug mafia and had busted different gangs.

Explaining progress on implementation of the decisions taken in last week’s meeting on law and order, the DIG said he had held meetings with the DHA authorities for the installation of more CCTV cameras and fixing the faulty ones. Street lights in the DHA and Clifton areas were being improved and upgraded, he added.

The IGP told the chief minister that the culprits of the Chinese consulate attack had been arrested. Additional IG of the CTD Dr Waliullah Dal and CTD DIG Abdullah Shaikh briefed the chief minister on busting a gang involved in making fake arms licences even of banned bores.

IGP Imam said that on the lead given by the arrested suspects (involved in making fake licences) their facilitators in the police department and DC offices had also been taken into custody.

Steps to curb street crime

DIG East Amir Farooqui and DIG West Amin Yousafzai briefed the chief minister on the steps taken by them to curb street crime.

The IG police said that he had created a special force of 10 to 20 well-trained policemen being stationed at the SSP offices so that they could be called in case of any eventuality. The first batch of the force had been posted in the South zone in the first phase and in the second phase this deployment would be made in other zones. This initiative has been made after the attack on the Chinese consulate when police force was called from different police stations.

The IGP told the chief minister that he was preparing a mechanism to start police recruitment round the year as “over 10,000 policemen retire from service every year, therefore recruitment process as approved by the chief minister was being started”.

The meeting was attended by Adviser on Law Murtaza Wahab, IGP Kaleem Imam, home secretary Kazi Kabir, AIG CTD Dr Waliullah Dal and Commissioner of Karachi Iftikhar Shallwani.

Business portal

Four provincial government departments signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to launch Sindh Business Registration Portal to help entrepreneurs complete all their registration procedure online.

The MoU was signed between the investment department of government of Sindh and SECP, labour department, industries and commerce department and Sessi.

",2019-01-17,"KARACHI: While ruling out governor rule in Sindh, Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry insisted on Wednesday that the province would witness change under constitutional guidelines and repeated his suggestion to the Pakistan Peoples Party to remove Syed Murad Ali Shah from office of the chief minister before the “practical measures” brought him down.

Speaking to reporters after visiting production unit of an automobile company at Port Qasim, the federal minister was confident about the change in Sindh and “bleak” political future of the PPP in the province.

“The future of PPP in Sindh is no different from Pakistan Muslim League-N’s in Punjab,” he replied to a question.

“So the change is imminent here in Sindh and in democracy it comes through constitution and defined rules. The theory of governor rule is out of the question; it’s not possible in current scenario of parliamentary and democratic rule.”

Responding to a question, he said Prime Minister Imran Khan had met Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan leaders in Islamabad where they discussed the proposed measures for Karachi in the upcoming mini-budget to be announced on Jan 23.

“The MQM is our key partner and for development of Karachi we both would devise a joint strategy. As an immediate measure, we have decided to activate the federally-administered Karachi Infrastructure Development Company for different projects. The people of Karachi would soon see positive outcome of this partnership between the two parties,” added the federal minister.

20,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457957/irsa-asked-to-ensure-fair-distribution-of-water-among-provinces,"Irsa asked to ensure fair distribution of water among provinces
",2019-01-17,"KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Wednesday spoke on the issues afflicting Sindh because of persistent water shortages as the provincial assembly passed a motion asking the Sindh government to approach the Centre for judicious water distribution among all federating units.

An extensive debate was held during the Sindh Assembly session, chaired by Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani, on an adjournment motion moved by Pakistan Peoples Party’s Heer Soho to discuss the role of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) in distributing water among the provinces in the light of the 1991 Accord — an agreement signed by then chief minister Jam Sadiq Ali.

A number of members of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which rules Islamabad, were present in the house, but they opted not to participate in the debate.

Murad Ali Shah questions PTI lawmakers’ sincerity with Sindh

No participation from PTI in debate

Chief Minister Shah did not hide his anguish on the silence of the PTI members who sat idle while everyone else spoke and expressed their anger against Irsa’s attitude towards Sindh.

“Not a single member of a big political party took part in this debate, which reflects how sincere they are with Sindh,” said a displeased Shah. “They should have spoken here; no matter against or for our stance. But, they vanished from the scene on such an important issue for Sindh.”

He also indicated the absence of the parliamentary party leader of the PTI who spoke extensively earlier during a calling-attention notice, but preferred not to be in the house today.

Mr Shah gave a detailed background about the water woes of Sindh, which, according to him originally begin in 1859. He said it was not just the Indus, but Sindh would get water from five other rivers as well.

He said the colonial rulers rejected the Greater Thal Canal scheme twice; yet, it was constructed during a dictator’s regime.

Despite British rulers’ actions against Sindh, he added, they chalked out and enforced an agreement after the construction of the Sukkur Barrage in which Sindh’s share was 48.74 million acre feet, which was still greater than Punjab’s 48.33MAF share then.

He said everyone had technically approved that agreement. However, after Partition, India stopped water to the then western wing of Pakistan forcing the newly created state to get its water by payment to India.

He said no expert was taken from Sindh and all of them belonged to the neighbouring province when Pakistan signed the Indus Basin Water Treaty in September 1960 and “sold” three of its rivers to India.

Too little water released downstream Kotri

“Such a treaty soon created problems; then, those at the helm decided why just Sindh take benefit from Indus and dams were constructed on the river. That was the time when problems for Sindh in getting its share of water got worse.”

He said instead of minimum 10MAF, just 2MAF water was allowed downstream Kotri this season. “Do you want to make the people of the lower riparian die of hunger and thirst?”

Mr Shah said even the 1991 Accord promised a separate share of water for Karachi, yet it was not being given.

He said Sindh was the province whose share was negligibly increased in contrast to Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan in the 1991 Accord. However, that share was never given to the province, he added.

He appreciated Balochistan for supporting Sindh’s case, saying he had contacted the chief ministers of Punjab and KP requesting them to help Sindh in getting justice.

Mr Shah said upon his efforts, the Council of Common Interests had formed a committee to resolve the water issue. The committee had met twice and its report was still awaited, he said.

He said Sindh was concentrating on the theme of conservation of water by lining the canals to make best use of the water available to the province.

Kalabagh dam termed a dead horse

He said there was a deficit of trust regarding the issue of the Kalabagh dam and appreciated an opposition member for highlighting conspiracies to give a new lease of life to the “dead horse” as the project was generally termed.

Ms Soho said Sindh was enduring agonising water shortages for years while the federal government was not ready to discuss the issue with the provincial government.

She accused Irsa of not making judicious distribution of water and demanded that the existing Irsa committee be dissolved and the federal nominee on the authority be taken from Sindh for being lower riparian in the new set-up.

Grand Democratic Alliance’s Nand Kumar said instead of passing resolutions and motions the government should evolve a mechanism, which can ensure that the issue gets resolved.

He said he smelled a conspiracy behind creation of water problems with Sindh by which “they try to revive the dead horse. But, I make it clear here that we’ll not allow you to construct the Kalabagh dam”.

PPP’s Aziz Narejo said shortage of water was 50 per cent at Sindh’s barrages, which multiplied miserably as water flowed downstream.

GDA’s Nusrat Sehar Abbasi said Sindh had not presented its case effectively. She echoed her colleague that conspiracies were on to revive the Kalabagh dam.

Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s Abdul Rasheed said instead of resolving such important issues, federal ministers were visiting Sindh only for engineering the provincial government’s collapse.

Mohammad Qasim of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan said: “It is not failure, but it is planned ignorance and hooliganism on the part of Irsa for not giving Sindh’s due share of water”.

Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s Jawed Hanif said Irsa distributed what it had in the system. He said it was time to stop wastage of water and make irrigation system efficient.

PPP’s Hina Dastagir said the federal government was taking measures to open gates for the Kalabagh dam. She said Punjab had never protested on the water issue because it had always benefited from the formula. She said Sindh’s deltaic region had been destroyed immensely.

Later, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Chawla tabled a motion in the house asking the provincial government to approach the Centre for getting Irsa to fairly regulate water distribution among the provinces.

",2019-01-17,"RAWALPINDI: Express­ing concern over the presence of a large number of Afghans living in Pakistan, the government has directed the law enforcement agencies to ensure strict vigilance and security till the repatriation process is completed.

The issue of Afghans living in Pakistan and their repatriation was discussed at a meeting held in Islamabad recently. Senior officials of the federal government and intelligence agencies attended the meeting.

The meeting was informed that the presence of a large number of Afghans (registered and unregistered) in Pakistan was a point of concern for law enforcement agencies. The officials were of the view that although the number of unregistered refugees was collated by the police through FIRs registered, there was a need to chalk out a comprehensive strategy at the national level for their repatriation.

Officials say there are many unregistered Afghans who have obtained Pakistani identity documents using illegal means

It was also pointed out that majority of the Afghan settlers were not willing to return and so a clear-cut policy might be devised for their early repatriation. The law enforcement agencies officials said that there was an urgent need to develop a mechanism for re-verification of Afghan refugees through biometric systems as 32 per cent of them were living in camps but the remaining 68pc were living outside camps.

The intelligence officials said that there were many unregistered Afghans who had settled in Pakistan and obtained Pakistani identity documents using illegal means. They suggested that till completion of the repatriation, the security around the refugees must be ensured to avoid any untoward incident.

The meeting asked the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions to share data of the total number of Afghans living in Pakistan and directed law enforcement agencies to ensure strict vigilance and security till the completion of the process.

Meanwhile, the Punjab government recently chalked out standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the security of foreigners, especially Chinese.

It was observed by the law enforcement agencies that foreigners were visiting sensitive locations without acquiring no objection certificate (NOC) from intelligence agencies concerned and provincial and district governments.

The fresh guideline was given to all divisional police chiefs and commissioners and suggested that all foreigners shall report their dep­arture and arrival details.

In line with the fresh SOP, computerised database and biometric record of each foreigner living or working in the area of jurisdiction of police will be maintained and the record will be tallied with the Federal Investigation Agency’s records.

",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: An accountability court on Wednesday approved the transit remand of former railways minister Khawaja Saad Rafique in a corruption case till Jan 21.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had produced Mr Rafique before the court of Justice Muhammad Bashir, seeking transit remand for five days.

When asked for how many days the National Assembly session would last, the court was informed that the session might continue for over five days and so it was likely that the court would be requested to extend the transit remand further. The court approved the request.

It is worth mentioning that Mr Rafique — who is in NAB’s custody in the Paragon Housing scam case — was shifted from Lahore to Islamabad last week as his production orders were issued by the National Assembly speaker.

Speaking to reporters, Mr Rafique said that whether under martial law or civil government, the term accountability was used but it was never genuinely implemented in the country. He suggested that the system of accountability should be revamped.

Replying to a question, he said that credit for the alliance of opposition parties went to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s “childish” approach.

“The government is non-serious and it cannot run the country. The coalition of opposition parties is the need of the hour as a joint opposition would be able to give tough time and force the government to perform,” he said.

Responding to another question, he said: “Those who have been talking about National Reconciliation Ordinance are foolish as no prime minister has ever been able to give NRO in Pakistan.”

",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: A special committee constituted by the Supreme Court in the case involving death of 10-year-old Amal Umer in Karachi has recommended that police personnel engaged in patrolling to control street crimes should not carry sub-machine guns (SMGs), rather pistols or handguns.

Read: How the system failed us

A three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had formed the committee under the chairmanship of a retired superior court judge, Justice Khilji Arif Hussain, and assigned it the task of identifying negligence on the part of police and private hospitals in dealing with emergency situations and suggest reforms after it had taken notice of the incident in which Amal died after being hit during an exchange of gunfire between police and robbers in Karachi.

Take a look: A crime unpunished

In its report submitted to the court on Wednesday, the committee pointed out that Karachi had in recent past gone through a law and order crisis, which had resulted in the killing of many innocent citizens and members of law enforcement agencies. Though the situation had now improved considerably on the sectarian and ethnic fronts, the challenge posed by street crimes had grown serious and was resulting in the loss of human lives and valuables almost on a daily basis.

Personnel should be trained to use appropriate force in tricky situations, says its report

It appeared that police had not prepared for the transitory phase and were still in the mode of fighting terrorism, said the report.

The committee recommended that SMGs should be authorised for use only in sensitive areas of Karachi, including some parts of South Zone (Lyari) and West Zone, in proportion to the threats posed.

The squads deputed to protect police officers, judges and ministers should carry only one SMG per vehicle and the remaining policemen should be armed with pistols, said the report. There is a specialised unit, namely the Rapid Response Force, which should be available and duty-bound for dealing with high-risk situations, which involve the use of heavy arms and ammunition.

The committee said that police personnel lacked training, adding that Karachi was highly urbanised and in the event of a police encounter a highly trained force was required. But it has been observed that police officers do not take refresher courses and/or conduct firing practice regularly.

As a result, they end up causing collateral damage, in the shape of loss of lives of innocent citizens. Therefore, there must be a mandatory requirement of refresher courses on a regular basis (at least after every six months). The committee pointed out that training with regard to urban policing was also required. The personnel should be able to assess the appropriate amount of force that should be used in a situation. The culture of carrying out encounters should be discouraged.

The personnel should also be trained to use measures other than using arms and ammunition wherever possible. Training to take calculated and proportionate decisions was pertinent, especially in urban policing, said the committee’s report.

The committee noted that police stations were still maintaining a manual system for recording arms and ammunition, which could be manipulated in case of a serious incident. Therefore, the inventories of arms and ammunition at the headquarters and police stations should be computerised and biometric machines should be installed to make the officials accountable.

The IBS facility should be used to identify the weapons and ammunition that are given to the personnel. In this way the weapon that is issued could be easily traced whenever it is fired or goes missing.

Weapon recognition should be coordinated with the biometrics to keep a complete check on who the weapon was allotted to, how much ammunition was used, etc.

The committee also highlighted the poor management of the operational and investigation branches of police. The additional SHO concerned was involved in misappropriation of recovered amount from the culprits. The official who had prepared the recovery memo was guilty of corruption and should be awarded severe punishment, it said.

The investigation officers failed to arrest the co-accused for a very long time, even though he could have easily been traced out earlier. The investigation branch required refresher courses and better supervision of senior officers in such cases.

A comprehensive strategy was required to implement the Smart City Project in Karachi. Unfortunately for a city of 22 million people, only 2,300 cameras were operational in the city and police had to rely on private CCTV footages, said the committee. The cameras available often produced footage of poor quality.

It was high time the project was implemented in the light of existing Supreme Court orders, said the committee. “It is recommended that the legislature enact (if need be) and/or the Sindh government enforces a mandatory requirement wherein all commercial entities have to install cameras on all outside corners of their shops, establishment, building, etc, at their cost of installation, running and maintenance,” read its report.

Cameras in residential areas should be the responsibility of the Sindh government and lack of this facility should attract penal provisions such as a fine on the owner/owners, the committee added.

",2019-01-17,"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua has said that the scope of activities for international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) has been defined in accordance with the nation’s requirements.

Speaking to foreign envoys on the issue of INGOs registration, she said “activities that are responsive to Pakistan’s national development priorities” had been identified.

The sectors in which INGOs are being encouraged to work are poverty alleviation, health, vocational education and training, science and technology, environmental protection, disaster management, sports and culture.

The government had started fresh registration of INGOs in 2015 after announcement of the registration policy. A total of 141 INGOs had applied for registration under the new policy, out of which applications of 74 were approved, while those of 41 were rejected.

Since the scope of activities was also restricted, some of the organizations, particularly those working on issues like democracy, governance, rule of law and security opted to close down.

The policy was criticised by donor countries as restrictive and non-transparent.

Defending the policy, Ms Janjua said the decisions on cancellation of registration and closure were in full accord with the standards of due process and that the right of appeal and opportunities to discuss mutual concerns were provided to the INGOs.

She recalled that 74 INGOs were still operational in the country.

The foreign secretary, however, reaffirmed the government’s commitment to a “mutually beneficial framework on INGOs, underpinned by rule of law, transparency and responsive to nationally determined development priorities”.

She further noted that the policy framework was “guided by Pakistan’s national context, circumstances, needs and priorities”.

It was agreed that the envoys of donor countries would remain engaged with the government for exploring options for addressing concerns of the INGO sector.

Donor countries have insisted that the new policy would affect Pakistan’s image as “a partner on human development”. They have, therefore, been demanding a “more cooperative and nuanced arrangement on INGOs”.

26,https://www.dawn.com/news/1458041/bnp-m-mulling-over-future-strategy-in-parliament,"BNP-M mulling over future strategy in parliament
",2019-01-17,"KARACHI: In less than six months of its existence, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government seems to be moving towards being mired in numbers game as one of its key supporters in the parliament, the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), has hinted at parting ways with the ruling party while complaining of its “non-seriousness” over the points both sides agreed when their partnership began.

Though BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal assured that no anti-government move would come from his party, he sounded impressed with the fresh political development in the country when the opposition parties agreed on formation of a committee to finalise a joint strategy to give tough time to the government, saying such moves “always bring political stability in Pakistan.”

“Let me make it very clear that we are not part of the government,” he said while responding to questions by reporters outside his DHA residence before a meeting of his party’s central executive committee. “We have provided them support while sitting on independent benches. We support their every positive move and oppose negative ones. But the fact is that we have not witnessed seriousness at the government’s end over our agreed points, which convinces us to review our strategy.”

PTI is non-serious over mutually agreed agenda, says Mengal

Sharing his experiences with the PTI government and Prime Minister Imran Khan, Mr Mengal said that after every meeting between the two sides, a committee was formed “for nothing,” which only suggested another meeting leaving the real issues stagnant at the same level where they were some six months ago.

“We agreed on the six-point agenda at the time of the presidential elections and earlier after the general elections we developed consensus on nine points. But unfortunately, not one of these points has been taken up. I think there is sheer lack of seriousness [on part of the PTI] and unfortunately there’s no change in its attitude despite several reminders,” the BNP-M leader said.

Days after the PTI secured majority in the July 25 elections, it reached an agreement with the BNP-M and the two parties signed a six-point memorandum of understanding (MoU) after a marathon session between Mr Mengal and Shah Mehmood Qureshi. Under the MoU signed by Mr Mengal and Mr Qureshi, the BNP-M — having four seats in the National Assembly — had supported the PTI candidates for the office of prime minister and speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly.

However, cracks started emerging in the parliamentary partnership within a couple of months and Mr Mengal on record warned the PTI leadership that his party could withdraw its support for the federal government if the ruling party continued ignoring it while taking decisions about Balochistan. The warning, it appears, has now turned into action from Mr Mengal who is mulling it over before making a key decision about his party’s future strategy in the parliament while acknowledging the alliance of the opposition parties.

“We are not going to make any move against the government and if they review their strategy we would continue to support it,” he replied to a question about possible role of his party, after withdrawing support for the government, in the opposition alliance that had emerged recently. “The meeting of [Pakistan Peoples’ Party leader] Asif Zardari and [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz chief] Shahbaz Sharif is a good omen. The political forces always move together for strong democracy despite differences. I think it would bring political stability in the country.”

On Tuesday, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry visited the temporary headquarters of the MQM in Bahadurabad, where he discussed implementation on several decisions made between the two coalition partners a few months ago.

On the occasion, the federal minister had brushed aside the impression of any dispute or disagreement between the two sides. The minister had told reporters, “In today’s meeting, we have discussed and reviewed the memorandum of understanding which we signed at the time of formation of the government. Several points of the MoU have already been executed while others will also meet the same fate soon.”

Earlier in the same meeting, MQM's deputy convener Kanwar Naveed Jameel reminded the federal minister of promises of funds from the Centre for a public university in Hyderabad and other development schemes in urban Sindh.",Sanaullah Khan,"['muttahida', 'qaumi', 'movement', 'pakistan', 'mqmp', 'delegation', 'wednesday', 'called', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'pm', 'house', 'islamabad', 'discuss', 'issues', 'pertaining', 'coalition', 'centre', 'meeting', 'came', 'backdrop', 'rising', 'tensions', 'ptiled', 'coalition', 'government', 'opposition', 'ppp', 'pmln', 'reportedly', 'forming', 'alliance', 'order', 'give', 'tough', 'time', 'incumbent', 'government', 'wake', 'rising', 'tension', 'government', 'major', 'opposition', 'parties', 'pti', 'coalition', 'partners', 'pushing', 'ruling', 'party', 'fulfil', 'promises', 'made', 'time', 'forming', 'coalition', 'mqm', 'delegation', 'talked', 'challenges', 'faced', 'people', 'living', 'megacities', 'sindh', 'premier', 'responded', 'saying', 'aware', 'aware', 'challenges', 'faced', 'people', 'sindh', 'federal', 'government', 'play', 'role', 'resolve', 'problems', 'said', 'decided', 'meeting', 'committee', 'constituted', 'chairmanship', 'sindh', 'governor', 'imran', 'ismail', 'strengthen', 'coordination', 'two', 'parties', 'connection', 'development', 'projects', 'provincial', 'level', 'two', 'sides', 'also', 'decided', 'obstacles', 'restoration', 'karachi', 'circular', 'railway', 'kcr', 'removed', 'priority', 'basis', 'also', 'decided', 'premier', 'lay', 'foundation', 'stone', 'university', 'hyderabad', 'besides', 'minister', 'information', 'technology', 'khalid', 'maqbool', 'siddiqui', 'minister', 'law', 'justice', 'dr', 'farogh', 'naseem', 'mna', 'syed', 'ameenul', 'haq', 'meeting', 'also', 'attended', 'minister', 'finance', 'asad', 'umar', 'special', 'assistant', 'pm', 'naeemul', 'haq', 'mna', 'malik', 'mohammad', 'amir', 'dogar', 'monday', 'balochistan', 'national', 'party', 'bnpmengal', 'leader', 'sanaullah', 'baloch', 'said', 'party', 'decided', 'review', 'relations', 'ruling', 'pti', 'government', 'islamabad', 'following', 'byelection', 'senate', 'seat', 'balochistan', 'tuesday', 'information', 'minister', 'fawad', 'chaudhry', 'visited', 'temporary', 'headquarters', 'mqm', 'bahadurabad', 'discussed', 'implementation', 'several', 'decisions', 'made', 'two', 'coalition', 'partners', 'months', 'ago', 'occasion', 'federal', 'minister', 'brushed', 'aside', 'impression', 'dispute', 'disagreement', 'two', 'sides', 'minister', 'told', 'reporters', 'today', 'meeting', 'discussed', 'reviewed', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'signed', 'time', 'formation', 'government', 'several', 'points', 'mou', 'already', 'executed', 'others', 'also', 'meet', 'fate', 'soon', 'earlier', 'meeting', 'mqm', 'deputy', 'convener', 'kanwar', 'naveed', 'jameel', 'reminded', 'federal', 'minister', 'promises', 'funds', 'centre', 'public', 'university', 'hyderabad', 'development', 'schemes', 'urban', 'sindh']","['mqm', 'delegation', 'calls', 'pm', 'khan', 'amid', 'brewing', 'tensions', 'within', 'ruling', 'coalition']"
31,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457907/ihc-did-not-adhere-to-sc-guidelines-about-bail-judgements-while-deciding-sharifs-petitions,"'IHC did not adhere to SC guidelines about bail judgements while deciding Sharifs' petitions'
",2019-01-16,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued its detailed judgement regarding the rejection of a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) appeal against the Islamabad High Court decision to suspend the prison sentences awarded to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in the Avenfield corruption reference.

A five-member larger bench of the SC had on Monday thrown out the accountability watchdog's appeal challenging the September 19, 2018, IHC order under which Sharif, his daughter and son-in-law retired captain Mohammad Safdar were granted bail after suspension of their jail terms.

The five-page SC written judgement, penned by Chief Justice-designate Asif Saeed Khosa, while detailing the reasons for dismissal of NAB's appeal has pointed out several flaws in the IHC judgement for suspension of the Sharifs' sentences.

The verdict notes that ""instead of adhering to the guidelines issued and recommendations made"" by the SC in an earlier case regarding shorter formats of orders to be passed in matters of bail, the high court had issued a 41-page judgement while deciding the Sharif's bail petitions.

According to the judgement, it is a settled principle of law that while deciding an application for bail or the suspension of sentence, the merits of the case are not commented upon in detail. However, the IHC in its impugned judgement ""had not only undertaken a detailed assessment of the merits of the case but had also recorded some categorical conclusions regarding the same"".

Besides, the Sharifs' writ petitions for suspension of their sentences were taken up at a time when their main appeals challenging the accountability court's verdict in the Avenfield case had already been fixed for hearing. This is in contrast to judicial norms, the judgement said, because sentences are usually suspended considering that a convict ""may not be kept in custody till his appeal is fixed for hearing"".

Citing previous cases, the written verdict says that the SC has clarified that in cases under the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 a high court may exercise its constitutional jurisdiction to grant bail ""only in extraordinary circumstances and in cases of extreme hardship"". But in the cases concerning the Sharifs, ""no such extraordinary circumstance or hardship had been referred to"" by the IHC in its judgement.

Additionally, the judgement says that by adverting to some deficiencies in the evidence that led to the Sharif's conviction under Section 9(a)(v) of NAO 1999, the high court had failed to consider that conclusions in that regard at the bail stage were ""premature"" as additional evidence could have been adduced or procured during the pendency of their appeals.

""Despite the above-mentioned deficiencies found by us in the impugned judgments,"" the verdict reads, ""we are cognisant of the legal position that considerations for grant of bail and those for its cancellation are entirely different"".

Detailing reasons for the dismissal of NAB's appeal, the SC judgement noted that the bureau had not levelled any allegations of misuse or abuse of the concession of bail by the Sharifs.

In addition, one of the three respondents (Nawaz Sharif) is already in jail after being convicted in another case; a second respondent (Maryam) is a woman and ""the law envisages concession for her in the matter of bail""; and the prison sentenced awarded by the trial court to the third respondent (Safdar) was quite short.

In these ""peculiar circumstances"", the SC bench did not feel persuaded to interfere with the jurisdiction exercised by the IHC in deciding the bail applications. NAB's appeal was thus dismissed.

On July 6, 2018, Judge Mohammad Bashir of the accountability court while deciding the Avenfield apartments reference had awarded 10-year imprisonment to Nawaz Sharif, seven years to his daughter Maryam and one year to his son-in-law Safdar.

Two months later, a division bench of the IHC had accepted their petitions seeking suspension of the sentence and set them free on Sept 19.

",2019-01-16,"The KP government has just approved plans of building a Rs42 million youth centre for women in Peshawar. The new facility in Hayatabad will include a gym, yoga classes, a modern theatre, a rooftop café, a children's play area and different game rooms.

Photos of the approval meeting were tweeted out yesterday by the tourism minister Mohammad Atif Khan who formally approved the budget in the presence of members of the KP Youth Development Commission, which is the think-tank responsible for planning the facility.

A youth centre, even a segregated one, can be a step towards more pronounced participation by women in Peshawar's public life. However, many noticed that women were ostensibly missing from the meeting, calling them to question if any were even consulted during the planning phase?

However, according to Asfandyar Khattak, Director Youth Affairs KP, the planning of the youth centre was undertaken by an all-women committee consisting of five female professionals. He explained that no women are seen in the photo because the female members were on the visit of the place finalised for the centre, and joined the meeting later. He added that the centre will be operational within three months and it remain open from 8am to 10pm.

Mr Khattak's clarification is a relief, for the apparent exclusion of women raises concerns about whether the centre's plans were informed by what men think women need rather than what women are given the space to demand?

An all-male meeting minimises the value of women's insight and representation and underscores a troubling trend — like often in the home, it's up to men to decide what privileges a woman can enjoy. For a youth centre to truly serve women, it needs to reflect their true needs.",dawn,"['kp', 'government', 'approved', 'plans', 'building', 'rs42', 'million', 'youth', 'centre', 'women', 'peshawar', 'new', 'facility', 'hayatabad', 'include', 'gym', 'yoga', 'classes', 'modern', 'theatre', 'rooftop', 'cafe', 'children', 'play', 'area', 'different', 'game', 'rooms', 'photos', 'approval', 'meeting', 'tweeted', 'yesterday', 'tourism', 'minister', 'mohammad', 'atif', 'khan', 'formally', 'approved', 'budget', 'presence', 'members', 'kp', 'youth', 'development', 'commission', 'thinktank', 'responsible', 'planning', 'facility', 'youth', 'centre', 'even', 'segregated', 'one', 'step', 'towards', 'pronounced', 'participation', 'women', 'peshawar', 'public', 'life', 'however', 'many', 'noticed', 'women', 'ostensibly', 'missing', 'meeting', 'calling', 'question', 'even', 'consulted', 'planning', 'phase', 'however', 'according', 'asfandyar', 'khattak', 'director', 'youth', 'affairs', 'kp', 'planning', 'youth', 'centre', 'undertaken', 'allwomen', 'committee', 'consisting', 'five', 'female', 'professionals', 'explained', 'women', 'seen', 'photo', 'female', 'members', 'visit', 'place', 'finalised', 'centre', 'joined', 'meeting', 'later', 'added', 'centre', 'operational', 'within', 'three', 'months', 'remain', 'open', '8am', '10pm', 'mr', 'khattak', 'clarification', 'relief', 'apparent', 'exclusion', 'women', 'raises', 'concerns', 'whether', 'centre', 'plans', 'informed', 'men', 'think', 'women', 'need', 'rather', 'women', 'given', 'space', 'demand', 'allmale', 'meeting', 'minimises', 'value', 'women', 'insight', 'representation', 'underscores', 'troubling', 'trend', 'like', 'often', 'home', 'men', 'decide', 'privileges', 'woman', 'enjoy', 'youth', 'centre', 'truly', 'serve', 'women', 'needs', 'reflect', 'true', 'needs']","['kp', 'government', 'really', 'opening', 'femaleonly', 'youth', 'centre', 'without', 'consulting', 'women']"

",2019-01-16,"Did you hear? Premiere Imran Khan was just gifted a gold-plated Kalashnikov with bullets by the Governor of Saudi Arabia’s Tabuk province, Prince Fahad bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz.

What use is this to IK?... We're not sure yet - but he seems extremely happy to be receiving it.

However, we're at odds with this choice of present and feel the PM could've been given a more 'thoughtful' gift, because really, Imran Khan is a man of simple taste.

Here're 5 things we feel would've been best suited for the PM. For starters...

1) A new set of clothes

It's a known fact that Imran Khan refuses to buy new clothes and since all his clothes are worn out, like IK's wife Bushra Maneka says they are, a few shalwar kameez and suits would've been a sweet gift. #NewYearNewMe

2) A gold replica of the '92 World Cup trophy

Let's be real, Imran Khan's 1992 World Cup win is something Insaafiyans cannot stop bragging about - and neither can he. Ask any PTI supporter why IK is best suited for his role as PM and they'll argue that he won us the World Cup... in the early 90s... which really isn't the same as running the country BUT it's still a win and this way at least Imran gets to brag about it while also showing it off in gold!

3) A free lifetime supply of Al Baik chicken

We all have our favourites, Nawaz loves paye, Imran loves chicken, what better way to win the PM's heart than a free lifetime supply of broasted chicken from the one restaurant Saudi Arabia is known for?

4) A set of gold dumbbells

The Prime Minister loves to exercise, we know because he's shown us, over and over and over again. A pair of gold dumbbells would've proved to IK that he's really, truly cared for.

5) More money for the dam fund

Nothing speaks volumes of love (for IK) than donating money towards his dam fund. Although the KSA has already donated Rs62 million towards it, it would've made up for the remaining population of our country that lives below poverty line - also not every expat can afford to donate $1000 or every Pakistani, Rs10.

",2019-01-16,"Prime Minister Imran Khan's official spokesperson Nadeem Afzal Gondal has also been appointed Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Coordination, it emerged on Wednesday.

A notification dated Jan 15 issued by the Cabinet Division states that Gondal's appointment ""shall be in honorary capacity"" and with immediate effect.

Gondal, a former PPP leader and a political heavyweight, had joined the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf last year. He was appointed as the prime minister's official spokesperson yesterday ─ a move that came as a surprise because he is a newcomer to the party and there are several senior PTI leaders who could have been considered potentials for the slot but were not.

The prime minister's hefty media team already comprised Iftikhar Durrani, the PM’s Special Assistant on Media with the status of a minister of state; Yousuf Baig Mirza, the PM’s Special Assistant on Media Affairs; Muhammad Sarfaraz, a deputy secretary and head of the PM’s official media cell; and Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, the government spokesman.

However, despite the presence of these heavyweights, prime minister Khan has in the past tended not to rely on them and expressed his views directly through tweets.

Read more: Gondal appointed prime minister's spokesperson

A source in the Prime Minister's Office said that Gondal would be working as the premier's spokesman on an honorary basis without a salary or other perks.

Gondal, also known as Nadeem Afzal Chan, joined the PTI in April last year, shortly before the July 25 general elections.

Before this, he was counted as one of the main leaders of the PPP in Punjab and was fairly vocal in the media in defending the policies of his party, presently in opposition.

He served as the chairman of the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee for nearly a year, from April 25, 2012, to March 16, 2013.

The Sindh government had approached the Supreme Court with the claim that since the subject of health had been devolved to provinces under the 18th Amendment, the management of the hospitals ─ namely the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), National Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases (NICVD) and National Institute of Child Health (NICH) ─ should rest with it.

",2019-01-16,"The Lahore High Court on Wednesday gave Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz one-time permission to leave the country for a period of 10 days.

Hamza along with his father Shahbaz Sharif and brother Salman Shahbaz is facing multiple National Accountability Bureau (NAB) inquiries, including those into Ramzan Sugar Mills road construction and assets beyond means.

The MPA had on Tuesday petitioned the court through Advocate Azam Nazir Tarar that the interior ministry had placed his name on the exit control list arbitrarily as no opportunity of hearing had been afforded to him before the impugned action.

The opposition leader had stated that he on Nov 27, 2018, intended to travel abroad to see his ailing wife, undergoing medical treatment in the United Kingdom. However, he said, he was informed by the authorities that his name had been included in the list on NAB's advice.

He pleaded that the right to travel and free movement was guaranteed under the Constitution, however, the impugned memorandum issued by the interior ministry was in utter violation of his fundamental rights.

The MPA contended that a bare perusal of the ministry’s memorandum showed that it had been issued in an unfair exercise of executive powers and failed to give any valid reason. He further pleaded that the act of placing his name on the ECL was in violation of Articles 2-A, 4, 9, 15, and 25 of the Constitution.

The petitioner asked the court to set aside the impugned memorandum for being unlawful and order the ministry to remove his name from the ECL. As an immediate relief, he urged the court to suspend the memorandum and grant him one-time permission to travel abroad till a final decision on the petition.

""I am the representative of the people of the largest province and have been taking regular part in all the NAB inquiries [against myself]. However, pending NAB cases have been made the reason for the inclusion of my name in the ECL,"" the petitioner argued.

Justice Muhammad Farrukh Irfan took up the petition in court today and allowed Hamza to leave the country once for a 10-day span.

""I belong to a political family and my name has been placed ECL dishonestly,"" he claimed.

""Does being a public representative mean that a person enjoys complete freedom?"" retorted Additional Attorney General Ashfaq A Khan, who represented the federal government in court.

""These courts are based on the premise that the law is equal for all citizens,"" Justice Irfan said.

The additional attorney general said that a high court judgement itself had laid down the rules for the restriction of movement for any citizen.

""If someone has caused monetary losses to the national exchequer they can be stopped from leaving the country,"" the advocate general told the court.

""Remember, those who are in the government today may be sitting in the opposition tomorrow,"" the judge said during the hearing, adding that the chief justice and SC judges are unhappy with the way NAB is conducting itself.

""Is the country going to be run by NAB? Should the courts and the parliament stop functioning?"" Justice Irfan wondered.

The interior ministry, passport and immigration personnel, and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) were made respondents in the petition, and the court issued the interior ministry a notice seeking its reply in the matter.

",2019-01-16,"WHAT was the impact of Chief Justice Saqib Nisar’s tenure on the fragility of Pakistan’s democracy? Justice Saqib Nisar challenged one of the foundational principles of democratic constitutional theory, according to which the judiciary’s role in executive and legislative affairs is circumscribed. Under the leadership of a new chief justice, the Supreme Court should decide whether Justice Nisar’s brand of judicial activism should be maintained or abandoned.

The SC’s authority to review legislative and executive action to assess whether it is consistent with the Constitution is well established, but in traditional democratic constitutions, the judiciary restrains itself from playing a prominent role in executive and legislative affairs. Judicial overreach that undercuts the democratic branches is not approved.

Read more: Judicial independence is vital for democracy but judicial activism can be counterproductive

In new and fragile democracies, however, courts tend to exercise more influence over other branches of government, reflecting the recognition that these institutions may not have the capacity or willingness to enforce fundamental human rights and provide public services equitably and transparently. Article 199 and Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan give our superior judiciary the authority to make orders to enforce fundamental rights. Similar provisions exist in India’s constitution.

Judicial intervention in politics should be judged on the basis of whether it promotes democratic governance.

The expanded role of the judiciary in new and fragile democracies of the Global South is visible in India, South Africa, Brazil and Colombia. In these jurisdictions, the role played by courts would, broadly speaking, not be countenanced in more mature Western democracies. In the contexts of newer democracies, the challenge posed by dysfunctional governance is one of the central concerns of the judiciary. This ethos is encapsulated in the words of a former chief justice of the Indian supreme court: “The court has to innovate new methods and devise new strategies for the purpose of providing access to justice to large masses of people who are denied their basic human rights and to whom freedom and liberty have no meaning.”

While new and fragile democracies may present a better case for an expansive judicial role, these same contexts are also most vulnerable to the stifling effects of judicial overreach. Where the judiciary positions itself as a replacement of political branches of government, it runs the risk of stunting the growth of these institutions, and where the judiciary repeatedly shames the executive branch, it threatens to discredit democratic institutions.

In such circumstances, judicial activism may actually serve to promote the backsliding of fragile democracies towards authoritarianism, which is arguably what we have witnessed in Pakistan since the lead-up to the 2018 national elections.

How then should the court’s role be defined in fragile democracies? Judicial intervention in political affairs should be judged on the basis of whether it promotes democratic governance. Judicial activism is justified if it strengthens civil society and promotes constitutional culture among the public at large. Conversely, judicial activism that has the effect of stunting democratic institutions must be rejected.

How does Justice Nisar’s brand of judicial activism fare against this standard? Justice Nisar took on significant public programme and policy initiatives that typically fall within the powers of the executive and legislature, most notably the Diamer Basha and Mohmand dam fund-raising campaign. Justice Nisar also displayed little faith in the ability of civilian bureaucracies to carry out their duties.

Read more: Pakistan hasn’t succeeded in reforming its bureaucracy in the past. Can the PTI deliver?

Instead of leaving the investigation of certain high-profile cases to law-enforcement authorities, such as the police and the FIA, in their normal course of duty, Justice Nisar ordered the constitution of Joint Investigation Teams.

At the same time, his highly publicised visits to government hospitals where he berated officials for their incompetence reflected an impatience with civil bureaucracies. By taking notice of the quality of bottled water and exorbitant private school fees, the chief justice authoritatively stepped in to fill what he perceived to be gaps in private-sector regulation by the government.

Justice Nisar used his suo motu powers expansively and initiated cases on issues that he considered to be the pressing concerns of our time, such as water scarcity and high rates of population growth. In devising remedies, the voice of Justice Saqib Nisar was pre-eminent. Any role played by human rights activists, civil society groups or the affected public was largely muted.

The effect of Justice Nisar’s court has been perceived as undermining political institutions either by assuming the role and responsibility of political branches or by openly displaying contempt towards elected officials and civil bureaucrats. Justice Nisar’s interference with executive and legislative affairs exposed what many would consider the questionable side of judicial activism and its threat to the evolution of democracy.

How is the SC to avoid this effect while at the same time play its role in enforcing fundamental rights in matters of public importance, as envisaged in Article 184(3) of the Constitution? Public-interest litigation should be used as a means to expand democratic spaces rather than judicial promotion. Instead of aggressively using its suo motu powers, the superior judiciary should encourage cases initiated by affected citizens and civil society groups. Since new and fragile democracies such as Pakistan are plagued with non-transparency, the SC should use its constitutional mandate to fill this gap by devising remedies that create space for civil society to monitor government performance. The main goal of the SC’s exercise of judicial power should be to enhance citizen engagement and accountability.

After Justice Nisar’s retirement, the SC has the opportunity to reassess its constitutional role based on the principle that a more ­modest exercise of power is conducive to ­democratic growth. The SC can remedy government dysfunction by creating spaces for civil ­society rather than using its judicial power to ­overshadow political discourse.

",2019-01-16,"WITH Pakistan-India ties seemingly in a deep freeze, diplomats and consular staff of the two countries once again appear to have become victims of harassment and intimidation.

A 1992 agreement, a code of conduct that both countries agreed to for the treatment of diplomatic and consular personnel in India and Pakistan, is being tested after Pakistan protested the police detention of a Pakistani High Commission official in New Delhi, and India has countered with allegations of rough behaviour by Pakistani security personnel against senior Indian diplomats in Islamabad.

The latest accusations come less than a year since India and Pakistan once again decided to abide by the 1992 code of conduct, a re-commitment that became necessary after a spate of unsavoury incidents in New Delhi and Islamabad.

The fresh incidents should be dealt with quickly and appropriately in both New Delhi and Islamabad — whatever the difficulties in ties between the two states, diplomats must be allowed to continue with their work of representing their country and should not face intimidation and harassment.

Unhappily, some elements in both countries view normal diplomatic work with a great deal of suspicion and perhaps do not comprehend the risks of a diplomatic rupture between the two states.

The disruption to the lives of diplomats is just the latest indicator that a serious rethink of the state of Pakistan-India ties is needed in both countries.

The Pakistani leadership — both the civilian and military — has repeatedly stated its interest in dialogue on all issues with India, including terrorism, but the stubbornness of the Indian leadership has not made possible even preliminary talks about eventual dialogue.

Perhaps the Pakistani leadership can look towards specific offers and innovative ideas to draw the Indian leadership into a dialogue process.

Of course, if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government only see Pakistan as a useful rhetorical and political foil in the upcoming Indian general election, there may be nothing that the Pakistanis can do to try and break the impasse in bilateral relations.

Whatever the case, the tendency to target diplomats in India and Pakistan is an unwelcome practice that must immediately cease. The 1992 bilateral code of conduct has survived many ups and downs and acute tensions. It is a sensible agreement that ought to be upheld by India and Pakistan both in letter and spirit.

",2019-01-16,"ISLAMABAD: A high alert has been declared at Pims to deal with any untoward situation.

The hospital spokesman, Dr Wasim Khawaja, told Dawn: “The step was taken in view of an alert issued for Punjab by the inspector general of the provincial police.”

All necessary measures mentioned in the standard operating procedure (SOP) have been adopted, Dr Khawaja said.

Under a high alert, duties of doctors and paramedical staff are assigned and their leaves are cancelled.

Besides, the availability of all necessary medicines as well as stock of blood are ensured and ambulances are put on a standby.

A senior police officer said high alert or red alert was declared on a threat alert issued either by the capital administration or the interior ministry. So far no such alert has been issued for the capital, he added.

“Security measures in the capital are already on a state of high alert since long,” said the officer.

But senior police officers have been asked to review the security measures for important public places.

Police pickets at the entrance of the capital were strengthened and personnel asked to keep an eye on suspects and suspicious vehicles.

The alert issued by the IGP stated that according to intelligence, four TTP militants were planning to conduct an attack on an intelligence setup in Lahore and anywhere in Punjab, said the police officer.

42,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457882/editorial-a-year-on-to-naqeebullahs-murder-is-police-still-above-the-law,"Editorial: A year on to Naqeebullah's murder, is police still above the law?
",2019-01-16,"A YEAR ago, the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud in Karachi sparked public outrage of an intensity that seemed impossible for the state to ignore.

Staged police encounters both in Sindh and elsewhere, especially Punjab, have gone virtually unchallenged over decades, claiming the lives of untold numbers of innocents, or at least of those not yet proven guilty. But this one caught the imagination of civil society. Perhaps it was because the story of the young man — no terrorist as alleged by the cops but an aspiring model — found its way on to social media where it echoed for weeks. Or maybe it was simply the straw that broke the camel’s back — one murder too many even in a country inured to state brutality, that too allegedly at the hands of ‘encounter specialist’ SSP Rao Anwar.

Dawn Investigation: Rao Anwar and the killing fields of Karachi

The event also proved a catalyst for festering resentments among a large segment of the population to coalesce into a movement for human rights. Nevertheless, one year on, the trial court has yet to indict the senior police official, who has since retired, or the other 25 suspects.

The facts of the case were, sadly, unexceptional. Four men, Naqeebullah among them, were abducted by cops in Karachi’s Malir district, taken to an abandoned farmhouse in the area and shot dead on Jan 13, 2018.

Take a look: Waiting for the next Naqeebullah

None of the victims, it subsequently emerged, even had a criminal record. A police inquiry committee found circumstantial evidence of Rao Anwar’s presence at the scene of the killings; a supplementary charge-sheet accused him and his subordinate cops of registering fake criminal cases, kidnapping, murder, and destroying evidence.

Also read: 'Naqeebullah Mehsud was innocent, was killed in a fake encounter,' says inquiry team

The case against the top police official could have been a turning point in the bloody saga of police brutality and extra-judicial killings that has long afflicted this country. However, what has transpired since makes a mockery of the criminal justice system; indeed, it displays a wicked disregard for the possibility of transitioning into a well-ordered society.

Rao Anwar’s demeanour in court, where he would arrive with full protocol and without handcuffs, was unmistakably that of a man secure in the knowledge that he was above the law — indeed, as unaccountable as those whose backing he allegedly enjoys.

The former SSP was confined for a few months to the comfort of his own home, conveniently declared a sub-jail on flimsy pretexts. Even that restriction was lifted last July when he was granted bail by an anti-terrorism court.

Selective application of ‘justice’, an absence of due process, and the perversion of law enforcement into a vehicle of terror corrodes the very foundations of society, ensuring an unending cycle of violence.

The message that the lack of a trial thus far in the Naqeebullah case and the shocking indulgence shown to the prime suspect is that the police need fear no consequences for their actions against a hostage citizenry.

",2019-01-16,"IT has all the appearance of a well-intentioned attempt to square the circle between the youth’s need to find an occasion to express affection and joy (hardly an unseemly impulse) and the religious right’s calls to ban anything it deems in opposition to our culture and values (an ever-widening basket of ‘offences’).

And it may well be were it not for the fact that, beneath its benign surface, the alternative it offers betrays the selfsame posture of moral policing as its more strident diktats.

The announcement by a varsity in Faisalabad that it would observe Feb 14 as ‘Sisters’ Day’ might seem like a frivolous attempt at rebranding Valentine’s Day to give it a patina of ‘respectability’ (the vice chancellor’s stated rationale was to turn a ‘threat’ into an opportunity).

Read more: Valentine's Day now Sisters' Day: Faisalabad varsity to 'promote Islamic traditions' on Feb 14

Yet the VC also said that the university was mulling plans to distribute scarves, shawls and gowns to its female students. Implicit in this is the suggestion that what Pakistan’s sisters truly need is not gender parity (or even so much as a token gesture of genuine esteem) — but to cover themselves up.

The Pakistani sisterhood might look at such a backhanded proposal with bemusement, and wonder at the neglect of the nation’s brothers for the lack of public interest in their behaviour and attire.

Objectifying women’s bodies to counter purportedly Western perversions is surely an irony lost on our self-appointed gatekeepers of public decency.

Read more: The heart's filthy lesson

But it also speaks to a broader phenomenon in which, every year, state and private institutions alike descend into paroxysms of panic at the advent of Valentine’s Day. Legal, official or societal interventions to browbeat the public into abstaining from cheer demonstrate lack of restraint and respect for people’s right to choose.

And it is particularly sanctimonious juxtaposed with genuine, year-round social ills such as misogyny and gender-based violence (the antidote to which is not further maladjustment) conveniently ignored by those who would seek to proscribe all inter-gender interactions. Hopefully, this February, better sense will prevail.

“We have pulled out bodies of all the eight victims and handed them over to their families,” Abdul Saboor Khan, Upper Kohistan district police officer, told reporters.

The labourers were on way to Dasu, the headquarters of Upper Kohistan, from the dam site after work when their vehicle was hit by landslide on the Karakoram Highway.

The local people and police rushed to the scene and retrieved bodies after hectic efforts of many hours and shifted them to civil hospital in Dasu.

Those killed in the tragedy were identified as Hamat Mir, Sowan, Mohammad Ghani, Mohammad Riaz, Abdul Malik, Malook Badshah, Saifur Rehman and Shabir Ahmad.

People block the highway, seek compensation for families

“We have started an investigation into how the incident occurred,” said DPO Saboor.

Meanwhile, the angry people of Kohistan took to the streets later in the day and blocked the KKH in protest against Wapda. They also offered funeral prayers of the victims on the road and demanded compensation for the bereaved families of the workers.

“We will not reopen the highway to vehicular traffic until Wapda announces compensation for the bereaved families,” said a speaker while addressing charged protesters.

He alleged that landslides were triggered because of the heavy blasting being carried out in the region by a Chinese company.

“The general manger of Dasu dam and I have started parlays with protesters to convince them to clear the highway,” said Mr Saboor, adding: “I am optimistic the highway will soon be opened to vehicular traffic.”

He said two sessions of talks had already been held with the protesters and hoped the third session would prove successful to convince the protesters to end the KKH blockade.

",2019-01-16,"PESHAWAR: Deputy Commissioner Peshawar Dr Imran Hamid Shaikh on Tuesday banned the use of plastic shopping bags in megamalls and medical stores.

Through an executive order, the deputy commissioner set a deadline for them to dispose of their present stocks within seven and 15 days, respectively, according to a statement issued here.

Mr Shaikh has directed the megamalls to use biodegradable plastic bags while medical stores to use paper bags in the larger public interest.

“The shopping bags mainly contribute to choking of drains, resulting in poor sanitation and water-borne diseases,” reads the order.

The order was issued in light of the provincial government’s instructions to the district administrations to take steps to stop usage of plastic bags in their respective districts.

Talking to Dawn, the deputy commissioner said in the first phase a ban had been imposed on the use of plastic bags in the shopping malls and medical stores. In the second phase, it would be applied on the grocery and fruit shops, he added.

Asked about any punishment over violation of the executive order, the DC said warnings would be issued to them after expiry of the deadlines.

After warning, he said, the available stocks of the shopping bags would be confiscated to be followed by the section 144 of the CrPC.

“I hope there would be no issue in the implementation of the ban as I have already consulted with the traders’ community of the city,” he said.

",2019-01-16,"PESHAWAR: Afghan Ambassador Shukrullah Atif Mashal on Tuesday claimed that Kabul and Islamabad had agreed to work out a mechanism for swapping prisoners, who had either completed their prison terms or were granted bail but couldn’t be freed due to certain reasons.

Addressing refugees here, the ambassador said the prisoners’ issue had come under discussion during a recent visit of foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to Kabul.

He said both sides had agreed on the exchange of prisoners.

Mr Mashal said the Afghan embassy’s team would visit various prisons in Pakistan for identification of prisoners.

“Many prisoners arrested in pity nature offences in the two countries should be released,” he said.

The ambassador said a 10-member team of Afghan government would visit prisons in Pakistan to find out prisoners, who had either completed their jail terms or were granted bails but couldn’t be released.

Afghan ambassador says mechanism to be developed for swapping detainees, who have served jail terms or got bail

He said he would also inspect prisons.

Mr Mashal said the Afghan government would facilitate Pakistani officials to inspect jails in Afghanistan to identify Pakistani prisoners, who couldn’t be freed due to some reasons.

The envoy, who assumed the charge in Islamabad around three weeks ago, didn’t explain whether the deal will be applicable to prisoners detained on charges of subversive activities and other heinous crimes in the two countries.

Both countries have yet to sign extradition or prisoner exchange treaties.

Earlier, during a brief chat with media, the Afghan ambassador failed to come up with a reply when asked about media reports that Afghan Taliban leader Hafez Mohibullah has been detained in Peshawar.

He said efforts were under way for peace in Afghanistan.

“We are here to work for peace in Afghanistan,” he said declining to comment on the detention of the Taliban leader.

The ambassador was very apprehensive about ill-treatment of Afghan nationals at the hands of Pakistani security personnel at Torkham border-crossing point and said the issue had been discussed with Pakistani Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

He said he would visit Torkham to review situation and would discuss the matter with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shah Farman and Corps Commander Shaheen Mazhar Mahmood today (Wednesday).

Mr Mashal said Afghan citizens coming to Pakistan were lined up at the entry gate for hours.

“We don’t need verbal promises. They (Pakistanis) should fulfil the promise of friendship, which they have been making,” he insisted.

The envoy said Pakistani authorities had promised to facilitate the entry of Afghan travelers at Torkham. He said he had proposed to make separate arrangements for women, elders and ambulance service at Torkham border to prevent mess and keep them from long wait.

Mr Mashal complained that every Afghan visa applicant was paying $200 outside Pakistani diplomatic mission in Kabul. He said the issue needed to be resolved.

The ambassador said officials of Pakistani missions in Kabul and Jalalabad were not involved in the illegal practice.

He said he had asked General Bajwa to increase the number of visas for Afghans and allow other consulates in Afghanistan to facilitate visa seekers.

Pakistani mission in Kabul issues 300 to 350 visas to Afghan nationals on a daily basis.

Mr Mashal expressed concern about the reports of the officials receiving bribes from Afghan truckers transporting goods under the Afghan Transit Trade.

He said ‘malpractices’ of the police and personnel of other law-enforcement agencies had a negative impact on the bilateral trade and therefore, Pakistani government should take measures for stopping illegal practices at checkposts.

The ambassador said he met Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and took up that issue with him as well.

He said Afghanistan wanted to increase the volume of trade with Pakistan. He asked Afghan and Pakistani traders to begin joint business ventures.

Mr Mashal said durable peace in Afghanistan was not only in the interest of Afghan nation but it would promote peace in the entire region.

He urged Pakistan and other neighbouring countries to play role for peace in his country.

“On average, 100 to 150 people are killed in Afghanistan daily. How long this bloodshed will continue as millions of people will continue to live in Pakistan as refugees,” he said asking his countrymen to stop living life as refugees by returning as soon as possible.

",2019-01-16,"ISLAMABAD: Early marriages and the practice of feeding girls less than boys are key reasons for stunting in children, the country director of the Global Aliiance for Improved Nutrition said on Tuesday.

Dr Qaiser Munir Pasha was speaking at a seminar on Adolescent Nutrition in Pakistan: Identifying Opportunities and Setting Priorities, which was organised by the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS).

Take a look: Why do child stunting and maternal health feature so high on Prime Minister Imran Khan's priorities?

Boys are generally given more food than girls, he said, because of which girls are unable to compete with boys in many fields, and malnourished mothers cannot give birth to health babies.

“Currently, 41pc of children do not go to school in Pakistan. The worst situation is in Balochistan, where only 20pc children go to school. There is need to ensure women and children are properly nourished because only that is how the mother and child mortality rate can be reduced,” he said.

Seminar on adolescent nutrition in Pakistan held

Dr Baseer Khan Achakzai, a health expert, said the first 1,000 days remain a critical period of nutritional need. Adolescence, the period between 10 and 19 years of age, is characterised by rapid biological and psychosocial growth and development. Up to 45pc of skeletal growth takes place and 15 to 25pc of adult height is achieved during adolescence.

“It is a vulnerable time with increased nutritional requirements, particularly for girls who are biologically vulnerable, while often lacking access to nutritious food, education, and other opportunities owing to gendered cultural norms,” he said.

NHS ministry representative Dr Khawaja Masood said the establishment of a platform dedicated to adolescent nutrition, the National Technical Advisory and Advocacy Platform for Improved Adolescent Nutrition, was a landmark achievement.

“This has not only served to bring together key partners in the adolescent nutrition space but will also anchor and drive further actions for adolescent nutrition in the country,” he said.

During the technical session, speakers explained that Pakistan has a high burden of malnutrition, costing $7.6 billion, or 3pc of the GDP, every year.

The evidence review suggested that adolescents experience a high burden of stunting, thinness, and being overweight. Girls appear to experience a higher burden of stunting (11-23pc) and being overweight/obesity (8pc) than boys (5pc for both).

Boys have a slightly higher prevalence of thinness (12pc) than girls (10pc).

Thinness is more common in rural areas and being overweight/obesity in urban areas. Anaemia is prevalent among adolescent girls (54pc) as well as deficiencies in folic acid (49pc), zinc (42pc) and vitamin A (40pc).

It was informed that household food insecurity is a major barrier to obtaining an adequate diet, especially in rural areas where more than half of households are food insecure.

The review further suggested that adolescent diets are generally poor, not sufficiently diverse, and are overwhelmingly of wheat and low in fruits, vegetables, pulses, potatoes, meat and eggs.

Adolescent girls rarely have control of food expenditure or distribution within the household; the primary decision makers for the purchase of packaged foods are their mothers, who have limited nutritional knowledge.

Although the age at first marriage is rising, one-third of women between 25 and 49 were married by 18, and 8pc of women between 20 and 24 gave birth by 18, increasing their risk of poor birth outcomes. Adolescents also have poor access to sexual and reproductive health care: only 13pc of adolescents between 15 and 19 use family planning services and 37pc of women between 15 and 49 receive at least four antenatal visits.

The court said such application could only be entertained after framing of charges.

The ex-PM was seeking exemption from personal appearance on account of visiting abroad. The prosecutor of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on the other hand argued that under the law an accused could not file exemption plea before indictment.

Former prime minister Gilani, former secretary of Information Technology Farooq Awan, former press information officer (PIO) Mohammad Saleem, former company secretary Universal Service Fund Syed Hasan Sheikh, the CEO of Messrs Midas (Pvt) Ltd Inam Akbar and several other individuals from the Ministry of Information Technology were named in the corruption reference.

",2019-01-16,"LAHORE: A special committee of experts constituted by the Supreme Court has expressed concern over the improper repair, maintenance and conservation of various heritage sites along the route of Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project.

The [committee] members, who visited 11 heritage sites along the route from Jan 14 to 15, have also sought immediate repair and maintenance of the sites in a professional manner.

According to a report, the committee headed by Sayed Zahid Hussain (former SC judge) and consisted of members including Zahid Saleem Gondal (director general, archaeology) Hammadul Hasssan (project director), Furqan Ali Malik (Nespak chief engineer), retired Prof Khurshid Ahmed, Dr Rizwan Riaz, Muhammad Afzal Khan, Maqsood Ahmed Malik, Raja Tariq Nazir and Muhammad Naeem Iqbal visited buildings of GPO, Shah Chiragh mazar and mosque, Supreme Court registry, Saint Andrew Church, Mauj Darya shrine and mosque, Chauburji Gateway and Zaibun Nisa Tomb on Tuesday. Similarly it visited Shalamar Garden, Buddu Ka Awa, Ghulabi Bagh and Lakshmi on Monday.

The committee observed that plaster inside the shrine of Shah Chiragh Tomb has decayed and there were also signs of dampness. Rafique Noor (EXEN, Auqaf department) on the occasion briefed the committee members that work on the renovation and conservation of the shrine and the mosque, which was constructed during the era of Shah Jahan, has commenced.

Similarly the paint, marble flooring, fresco paint, roof treatment and conservation work will also be carried out and visible changes will be made by the end of February 2019. The team noted that though major work on Saint Andrew Church was completed, a storm drain and ramp outside the church is yet to be constructed.

The committee witnessed removal of debris from the Mauj Darya shrine and completion of three temporary stairs at the shrine. However, it observed that construction of the retaining wall was yet to be launched due to paucity of funds. The team found tiles on the entrance to the shrine broken and the platform outside it required finishing. The team, however, appreciated the mosaic tile work at outer lawn of the Chauburji. The team observed that the gateway was yet to be converted into green belt despite availability of funds with the executing agencies.

On the occasion, the LDA officials told the committee that boundary wall, footpath and drain of both GPO and Supreme Court registry have been completed. However, the committee noticed that exhaust ducks boundary wall is yet to be completed.

The members found heaps in the Zaibun Nisa shrine. Similarly, according to them, red stone and fresco work of the tomb required finishing. Back side of the tomb needed some repair as there were some cracks in the tomb.

Earlier while visiting other sites, the committee members were told by the officials that the hydraulic tank of the Shalamar Gardens has been restored to its original position and the surrounding portion converted into green area. They also claimed that decorative motifs of Shalamar Gardens have been replicated on the train station of Shalamar Garden to create harmony.

However, the committee emphasised the need to conserve and protect the monuments like Shalamar Gardens strictly in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court. The committee also found maintenance of Buddu Ka Awa not up to the mark. However, it commended the efforts of conserving Gulabi Bagh Gateway.

The committee noticed appearance of cracks in Lakshmi building and directed the officials for strengthening the columns and filling of the cracks within the shortest possible time.

",2019-01-16,"LAHORE: Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz has approached the Lahore High Court for removal of his name from the Exit Control List (ECL).

Filed through Advocate Azam Nazir Tarar, Hamza stated in a writ petition that the interior ministry placed his name on the exit control list (ECL) in an arbitrary manner as no opportunity of hearing had been afforded to him before the impugned action.

The opposition leader stated that he on Nov 27, 2018, intended to travel abroad to see his ailing wife, undergoing medical treatment in the United Kingdom. However, he said, he was informed by the authorities that his name had been included in the list on the advice of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

Mr Hamza pleaded that the right to travel and free movement was guaranteed under the Constitution, however, the impugned memorandum issued by the interior ministry was in utter violation of his fundamental rights.

He contended that a bare perusal of the ministry’s memorandum showed that it had been issued in an unfair exercise of executive powers and failed to give any valid reason.

He further pleaded that the act of placing his name on the ECL was in violation of Articles 2-A, 4, 9, 15, and 25 of the Constitution.

The petitioner asked the court to set aside the impugned memorandum for being unlawful and order the ministry to remove his name from the ECL.

As an immediate relief, he urged the court to suspend the memorandum and grant him a one-time permission to travel abroad till the final decision of the petition.

Justice Farrukh Irfan Khan will take up the petition on Wednesday (today).

Hamza along with his father Shahbaz Sharif and brother Salman Shahbaz is facing multiple NAB inquiries, including those into Ramzan Sugar Mills road construction and assets beyond means.

",2019-01-16,"LAHORE: The provincial government on Tuesday informed the Lahore High Court that a special committee had been constituted to decide whether to allow celebration of Basant festival.

During the hearing of multiple petitions against the government’s plan to allow the kite flying, a law officer also told the court that no decision had been taken so far with respect to celebration of the Basant festival.

He said the committee formed by the government on the matter would submit its recommendation within two weeks.

Advocates Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, Sheraz Zaka and others had filed the petitions in public interest, pleading that the kite flying was a deadly sport and could not be allowed at the cost of citizens’ fundamental rights.

The petitioners also challenged the Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying Ordinance 2001 under which the government enjoyed discretionary powers to permit kite-flying activities.

They said the Supreme Court in its 2006 judgment had declared the kite-flying and celebration of basant festival a violation of the fundamental rights.

However, they said, the government introduced an amendment to the law, acquiring the power to allow kite-flying without defining any criteria.

The petitioners asked the court to restrain the government from allowing kite-flying or celebration of basant festival.

They further asked the court to declare null and void the section 4(1) and 4-B of the ordinance, which empowered the government to permit the kite-flying.

Justice Aminuddin Khan adjourned the hearing till Jan 24 for further arguments and also allowed the petitioners to implead the Kite Flying Association in the case.

",2019-01-16,"LAHORE: Former health minister Khwaja Salman Rafiq, who is under NAB custody, attended the Punjab Assembly session on Tuesday after Speaker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi issued his production orders, urging the National Assembly to amend NAB laws to protect basic human rights of all those arrested by it.

The treasury and opposition benches welcomed the [under-arrest] MPA and resolved to concertedly protect democracy in the country.

The speaker had issued the production orders before the start of the session under the assembly rules which were jointly amended for the purpose by a committee comprising members from both the treasury and opposition benches on Monday.

Kh Salman attends session after production order

Khwaja Salman was led to the house by his colleagues amidst slogans. He and former speaker Rana Iqbal thanked the speaker, deputy speaker and the law minister for allowing the facility which earlier missed in the rules.

Rules of the National Assembly and the assemblies of the other three provinces already allow speakers to issue production orders of members who are under arrest.

Mr Salman is in NAB custody along with his brother Khwaja Saad Rafique in connection with the Paragon City scam. He did not complain of any maltreatment by NAB during his captivity, and avoided to discuss the case against him saying it was sub judice and he believed courts would dispense justice.

He conceded that the NAB laws should have been changed in the past, and said the current National Assembly had already worked on the laws a great deal, and should now amend them. The PTI chairman (Imran Khan) should also be approached for the purpose, he said.

Salman said the parliament should revisit the NAB powers to obtain 90-day remand of the accused in any case. It should also check whether a poor government official could afford to pay high fees of lawyers to defend against [NAB] allegations.

Mentioning Nawaz Sharif, Shahbaz Sharif, Saad Rafique and others, he said the PML-N leadership was in jail. (Outside the assembly he said the PML-N was facing targeted accountability).

Salman said the PPP and the PML-N had undergone several tests (of hardship), and did not wish the same for the PTI. “We should stop watching self-interest and start thinking of collectively,” he said. The parliamentarians should make a national road map and serve the nation.

The former minister said all political parties had sacrificed lives, mentioning his father, Saad Rafiq, Dr Nazir and Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi and others who were murdered. At this point Deputy Speaker Dost Mazari added the name of Nawab Akbar Bugti in the list of martyres, and welcomed Khwaja Salman in the house.

Rana Iqbal thanked the speaker, law minister and the treasury benches for amending the rules that allowed Salman’s production. The deputy speaker termed the move a victory of the house.

Law Minister Raja Basharat said by amending the rules, the assembly acted independently. “Let us resolve to concertedly protect democracy and its institutions for all times to come,” he said.

PPP’s Parliamentary Leader Hasan Murtaza thanked the assembly and the government for taking a positive step. “Some people think that the unity of politicians would squeeze their space,” he said.

After the house was adjourned till Wednesday morning, Khwaja Salman called on the speaker in his chambers to pay his regards [for issuing the production orders]. The speaker had earlier told the media that he had issued the orders after consulting the prime minister the CM, the law minister and the entire house.

WHEAT STOCKS: Earlier, the speaker took exception to Food Minister Samiullah’s lack of knowledge about the rotting huge wheat stocks, fixing time for debate on the issue on Wednesday (today). “Check the wheat policy and present it in the house at 2pm tomorrow (Jan 16),” he said after the law minister agreed on the debate.

The issue was agitated by PML-N’s Malik Arshad who asked the government to clear its 2.2 million ton wheat stocks by selling it to people at subsidised rates or exporting it to get rid of the burden and create room for further procurements after two months.

Malik Kamran said the clearance of the stocks was necessary to protect the economic rights of wheat growers. “The government is paying daily Rs 40 to 50 million to banks as interest for huge loans it had obtained for procuring wheat. It is better to sell the stocks to people at subsidized rates,” he said.

The minister said the government would not give any subsidy, and it would be able to clear the stocks anyways.

The deputy speaker, who soon replaced the speaker, referred an adjournment motion to the special committee for report in two months. The motion highlighted the attitude of the Benazir Bhutto Hospital’s [Rawalpindi] medical superintendent with regard to Dr Areeba Abbasi, daughter of the jailed PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi.

The motion was moved by PML-N’s Naseer Ahmad mentioning the victimisation of Dr Abbasi and putting on social media the telephone call of the law minister seeking some relief for the lady doctor after recording it.

The deputy speaker said the MS should have been suspended in the first place as “this may happen to me, you or anyone else.” He ignored the pleas by Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid that there was no victimisation and action against the medical superintendent would be taken within a week.

RESOLUTIONS: The house adopted a resolution moved by PTI’s Momina Waheed asking the federal government to have the Constitution and the elections law amended to allow for the cancellation of the assembly membership of those who fail to take oath of their office three months after their election.

Adopting another resolution moved by PTI’s Seemabia Tahir, the house paid tributes to the army for destroying an Indian spy drone in the Bagh Sector after it crossed over the Line of Control. The action proved that the army was ready to counter any aggression by India and would use all its capabilities to protect every inch of Pakistan, the resolution said, praying for further successes of the army.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was on Tuesday informed that the livestock and fisheries department had not been completely devolved to the province under the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.

Furnishing a statement during Question Hour in the assembly, Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Abdul Bari Pitafi said that the federal government had not fully devolved all functions and assets of the department to the province.

He said that these assets included the Korangi Fish Harbour, shrimp hatchery at Hawkesbay, livestock labs and other infrastructure.

Sindh has not been given control of Korangi Fish Harbour and shrimp hatchery at Hawkesbay

The minister further said that the provincial government had taken up the matter with the inter-provincial coordination ministry for devolving the assets to the province.

“A meeting was held on December 27, 2018 in which we sought sufficient funds from the federal pool for the provincial sector,” he added.

In reply to a question, asked by Khurram Sher Zaman of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, the minister said that the provincial livestock department was engaged with the federal government for the funds to be spent on development of fisheries.

Illegal nets

In reply to another question by Mr Zaman regarding unlawful fishing, Mr Pitafi said that the department was continuously combating against influential mafia in coastal brackish water area.

He said that more than 350 illegal nets were confiscated and cases were referred to the courts of law concerned. “About 120 illegal nets have been burnt after seeking the order from the honourable court”, he added.

The minister said that as far as the inland water was concerned regarding the illegal possession of influential people on any public water bodies, no written complaint was lodged by the bona fide fishermen in the fisheries department.

First biosafety level lab

Replying to other questions, he said that the country’s first “Bio-safety Level Laboratory and Quality Enhancement Cell for Highly Virus Vaccine Development” was also being established in Karachi.

The livestock minister said that vaccines of bird flu and foot-and-mouth diseases (FMDs) of livestock would be produced in this laboratory.

He said that the scheme was initiated in 2013 with a cost of Rs 160.639 million and had to be completed by 2018. However, it suffered delays owing to “typical” way of construction of such laboratories.

“The civil work is 95 per cent completed and now just the equipment has to be installed. The laboratory would be functioning by this year,” the minister assured.

To another question asked by opposition member Nusrat Sehar Abbasi, he said that a project to control “Surra”, an infectious disease among livestock, was initiated with the cost of Rs59.883m in arid and coastal zones at Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Umerkot, Sanghar, Khairpur and Jamshoro.

He said that the scheme was completed in June 2018.

To a supplementary question, he said medicine sufficient for 147,000 animals was imported and as many as 25,338 camels and horses were treated.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday directed its monitoring wing, comprising teams identified as “members of inspection team” (MIT), to file a consolidated statement of rape cases pending in courts across the province till Jan 31.

A two-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar issued the directive during hearing of a petition filed by Kainat Soomro and two other rape victims seeking implementation of the Supreme Court’s guidelines in rape cases and establishment of rape crisis cells at the district level.

At the outset of the hearing, the prosecutor general of Sindh contended that the police stations had already contacted the civil society organisations mentioned in the court order, adding that arrangements for DNA test was available at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) in Jamshoro and they had also inked a memorandum of understanding with the Karachi University for setting up a laboratory on the campus.

Order issued on plea to make rape cases’ investigation effective and DNA tests and preservation of DNA evidence mandatory

While putting off the matter till Jan 31, the bench directed the MIT-II to file a consolidated statement of pending rape cases in the province for further directions at the next hearing.

The petitioners were seeking implementation of a Supreme Court judgment (PLD 2013/107) about making investigation process of rape and assault cases effective and also sought directives for provincial government to make DNA tests and preservation of DNA evidence mandatory in rape cases.

They maintained that the SC had directed the provincial government and other authorities to reform the investigation process of rape cases, but the directions of the apex court were not being complied with, adding that rape victims were unable to get justice due to faulty process of investigation.

While impleading the Sindh health secretary, provincial police chief and others as respondents, the petitioners pleaded to direct them to take immediate steps to improve the investigation system and establish rape crisis cell in each district of the province to help victims in acquiring immediate medical, financial and legal assistance.

They also asserted that the Supreme Court’s guidelines for police investigation officers, medico-legal officers, trial courts should be implemented in letter and spirit.

Treatment of fistula patients

The same bench on Tuesday directed the health secretary to file a compliance report about arrangements made at government hospitals to treat fistula patients.

In compliance with an earlier order of the bench on a petition about fistula repair, health secretary Usman Chachar submitted that a requisition of appointment of nine gynaecologists especially dedicated to Tharparkar was sent to the Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) and it recommended only one candidate. The recommendations of SPSC on remaining posts were still awaited.

He further said that another requisition for appointment of 62 gynaecologists as well as to appoint 429 doctors had also been sent to SPSC, adding that he personally contacted the chairman of the SPSC to expedite the process.

The heath secretary submitted that a request had been made to the finance secretary for an amount of Rs5.880 million for maternal, neonatal and child health.

He contended that the facility to treat fistula patients was available at Chandka Medical College Hospital in Larkana, Peoples Medical College Hospital in Shaheed Benazirabad and the Liaquat University of Medical Sciences Hospital in Jamshoro and sought one month’s time to make the facility available at Ghulam Mohammad Mahar Medical College Sukkur.

In Karachi, the facility is available at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and the Koohi Goth Medical Hospital, a charitable hospital being operated by the main petitioner, he added.

The secretary said that his technical team would examine the reported cases of fistula repair in Karachi in consultation with the petitioners and after a proper evaluation further arrangements in different government hospitals at Karachi would be made.

The petitioners, including gynaecologist Dr Shershah Syed, contended that around 5,000 women died during pregnancy every year in the province due to lack of healthcare facilities in the rural areas.

They further submitted that there was a shortage of medical facilities as well as trained staff to attend to the patients, adding that the government had launched the maternal and newborn child health programme many years ago, but the funds allocated for the programme were never utilised.

The petitioners contended that there were over 1,500 fistula patients in the province, whereas a majority of government hospitals do not provide fistula repair surgeries.

They pleaded that the authorities concerned were directed to ensure access to affordable treatment of obstetric fistula to all women in the province and said that the provincial government should ensure that at least one qualified gynaecologist in every district was trained and equipped to provide fistula repair surgery.

Grant approved for treatment of girl

The bench was informed on Tuesday that the provincial government had approved an amount of Rs2,900,000 for a bone marrow transplant of an eight-year-old girl of Dadu.

The chief justice of SHC had taken notice about the illness of Rahat Batool since her parents could not afford her treatment.

In a previous hearing, the division bench headed by Justice Mazhar had directed the provincial government to provide funds for the treatment of the girl.

On Monday an official said that a summary was approved and the cheque would be handed over to the National Institute of Blood Diseases (NIBD) in three weeks.

He also said that the girl was admitted to the NIBD and the treatment had been started. The bench directed to hand over the cheque to the NIBD within a week.

Thalassaemia centres

An official of the health department on Tuesday sought time from the two-judge SHC bench to file a progress report about thalassaemia centres.

Mohammad Muzaffar and others moved the SHC seeking establishment of thalassaemia centres in Thatta and Sujawal districts.

The health official contended that they had already been making efforts to set up such centres and added that he would file a progress report at the next hearing as to how many thalassaemia centres were under operation with the cooperation of the Sindh government. The matter was adjourned till Feb 19.

57,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457759/sepa-to-seek-complete-details-of-dha-city-projects,"Sepa to seek ‘complete details’ of DHA City projects
",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) will ask the DHA City managers to provide complete details of its ongoing and future projects and carry out a cumulative impact assessment study.

This assurance came from Sepa during a public hearing held on Tuesday where they were quizzed over a lack of information about the DHA City projects.

The public hearing pertained to the environmental impact study of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCHRC) to be built at the Healthcare City, part of DHA City, in Gadap Town.

Public hearing about environmental impact study of Rs4.5bn Shaukat Khanum cancer hospital project held

Located near M-9, the project is estimated to cost Rs4.5 billion. It’s planned to get operational by 2021 as a 50-bedded facility and gradually have 400 beds for in-house patients.

The programme started off with a briefing on the hospital project. Zahid Hashmi, representing the hospital, said that it would be a third such facility by the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust in the country, which would act as a model institution for treatment of cancer patients in the country’s southern region.

“The project would be a state-of-the-art facility and would get accreditation by the Joint Commission International, one of the world’s leading patient safety organisations,” he said.

At present, there were only three hospitals in the country with JCI accreditation and SKMCHRC Lahore was one of them, he added.

Sharing project details, he said the hospital consisting of a basement and ground-plus-six floors would be spread over 20 acres and developed in three stages.

“The hospital will be equipped with the latest cancer care technology, including radiation bunkers fitted with linear accelerators for radiotherapy and nuclear medicine,” he said.

Giving a presentation on the project’s EIA study conducted by Global Environmental Management Services Pvt Ltd, Syeda Ibtasama Khatoon, representing the consultant, informed the audience that internationally reputed firms were being involved in its building and engineering design and its construction would also be supervised by experts.

“The hospital would have its own underground septic tank from where waste would be discharged into the DHA City sewage channels. Water requirement is estimated to be 12,000 gallons daily which would be met through supplies from the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board, DHA City as well as groundwater,” she said.

On the project’s environmental impact, it was pointed out that the proposed project site had “low abundance of flora and fauna, so its ecological impact is also low, which made the site ideal for constructing the facility.

“The proposed project won’t have any long-term impacts if activities are undertaken as suggested in this EIA report,” said Ms Khatoon.

Her presentation was followed by a question-answer session, which began with a Sepa official raising concerns over patient access to the hospital and disposal of refuse, including nuclear waste.

Responding to the concerns, Naved Zaheer, director of the Engineering Consultants International Ltd (ECIL), responsible for the project’s detailed engineering design and construction supervision, said that there would be a separate access for patients.

“There would be on-site incinerators and a waste treatment plant, separate from the one to be built by DHA City, whereas nuclear waste would be handled as per the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority guidelines,” he said.

The ECIL also specialised in healthcare design and the company had to its credit several hospitals in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Yemen and Pakistan, he added.

He rejected the possibility of any emergency involving nuclear waste leakage and said that radiation activity undertaken at such health facilities were of very low intensity and waste was handled as per the guidelines.

During the session, Sepa officials admitted that they didn’t have knowledge of that particular project when they approved the EIA study of DHA City in 2011.

“At that time, plots for residential, commercial and amenity purposes were only earmarked and investors came later in the picture,” said Imran Sabir, representing Sepa.

Replying to concerns about the fast-paced infrastructural developments in DHA City and how they would impact the environment, the communities living in surrounding areas and affect Karachi’ water resources in coming years, Naeem Mughal, additional director general of Sepa, assured the audience that the agency would ensure compliance with environmental and hospital management rules and regulations in the project/s.

“We will have a meeting with DHA City managers and seek complete details of their ongoing and future projects. We will ask them to submit their updated master plan as well as carry out a cumulative impact assessment of the whole project,” he said.

Dr Viqar Hussain, a senior geologist and consultant, urged Sepa to ensure that DHA City must evolve a plan for waste-water treatment and recycling.

Concern over the absence of DHA City’s representation was also raised.

58,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457760/sindh-assembly-adopts-resolution-to-stem-alarming-population-growth-in-sindh,"Sindh Assembly adopts resolution to stem ‘alarming’ population growth in Sindh
",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution unanimously calling upon the provincial government to take measures to rein in population growth in Sindh.

Two members of the religious parties opposed the resolution, moved by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Rana Ansar, during the debate. However, they were absent in the house when Speaker Siraj Durrani placed it for voting and it was passed unanimously.

The mover had originally scripted the resolution with the words “to control” the population. After an extensive debate, the words were replaced with “to plan” and approved by the house.

‘We want to provide 100pc coverage through the LHW programme for which recruitments are being made’

“This assembly resolves that [the] provincial government [should] take measures to plan population and launch awareness campaigns in this regard,” said the resolution.

Ms Ansar appreciated the Sindh chief minister saying that Sindh was the first province which set up a task force to “plan” the alarmingly increasing population. However, she said the government still had to do a lot of work.

She said the population issue should be part of the curriculum.

The MQM-P lawmaker said the government should use its lady health workers’ network effectively to launch greater awareness both in women and men.

“This should be a joint initiative by all the provinces if we [are] to handle the population problem,” she said.

Rana Ansar said slain prime minister Benazir Bhutto was the first leader who had launched the programme to seriously tackle the population issue, but later no targets could be achieved.

Health minister’s assurance

Population Welfare and Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho gave a detailed account of her ministry, stating that the population welfare department was seriously engaged in its effort to make planned population a reality.

“We are working on it diligently to ensure planned and responsible parenthood,” said Dr Pechuho.

She suggested to the mover that it was not controlling the population, as the latter had suggested in her original draft, but “we are working towards planned parenthood”.

The minister said: “We have limited resources, limited area and limited water reserves, all [this] warrants that we should not have a rapid and haphazard population growth”.

She said Sindh’s population was close to 50 million out of around 210 million of the country’s population. She added that women were the ultimate sufferers of the entire scenario.

“Woman is being deemed a child-producing factory at the expense of her own health and life. We have a horrible mothers’ mortality ratio, which is 178 out of 1,000,” she said. “There should be at least three-year birth space for a mother.”

Dr Pechuho said her ministry had chalked out various strategies to achieve the targets it had set. She said originally the LHW programme was launched to provide 45 per cent health coverage. However, with the passage of time the coverage dwindled due to decrease in the original strength of LHWs because of no regular recruitment.

She added: “Now, we want to provide 100pc coverage through the LHW programme for which recruitments are being made.”

She said the LHWs were being trained for advocacy and planned parenthood involving birth spacing and improved use of contraceptives. She added that the LHWs had been prepared to administer the first injection to mothers.

Responding to a member’s earlier speech objecting to rampant surgeries in women to stop pregnancy, the minister said such an action was the last resort.

Increased use of contraceptives

She said Sindh was the only province which had registered an increase in the use of contraceptives, though by a single percentage point. She added that the rural districts of Sindh had returned the figures showing a four per cent increase in the use of contraceptives.

However, in cities such as Karachi and Hyderabad the use of contraceptives had decreased.

She said the cities such as Karachi had a greater ratio of migrant population, which too had contributed to decreasing contraceptive usage rates.

All the basic health units and rural health centres were offering delivery and family planning services where contraceptives had also been made available, she said.

The minister said the government was providing free contraceptives to 200 privately run healthcare facilities and such hospitals were located in Karachi and several other districts. She said since the health department controlled the LHW programme, plans were afoot to integrate it with the population welfare department for better planning.

MQM-P’s Mohammad Hussain said political will was needed to achieve the target of a controlled population growth. He claimed the population welfare department was not proactive to achieve its designated targets.

Women Development Minister Shehla Raza also suggested the mover rearticulate the resolution by replacing “control” with “planning” the population.

PPP’s Kulsoom Chandio and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Shehzad Qureshi said the authorities concerned should take further measures and that they would have to work hard, particularly in the rural areas.

Grand Democratic Alliance’s Nusrat Abbasi said why only women were forced to go for surgery to stop pregnancy and why not such operations were performed on men.

MMA, TLP oppose the move

Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s sole member Abdul Rasheed opposed the resolution saying: “You will face the consequences if you go against the laws of nature”.

He claimed Pakistan’s population growth was ranked 84th in the world, and was not that high.

“Pakistan will be a country of elderly people if you control its population like that,” he warned.

Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s Mohammad Qasim opposed the resolution bluntly.

He said: “Allah has promised sustenance in the Holy Quran, and no force could go against it”.

Bills

The house approved for introduction two private bills — The Sindh Water Management (Amendment) Bill, 2018, moved by Rana Ansar, and The Control of Narcotic Substances (Sindh Amendment) Bill, 2018, moved by Rabia Nizami.

PPP’s Heer Soho withdrew her adjournment motion asking the federal government to give due share of NFC award to Sindh as contemplated in Article 160 (3A) of the Constitution after the chair said an extensive debate had already been held a day earlier on another adjournment motion by Nida Khuhro.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: The Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) on Tuesday raided the head office of a private courier company and seized a parcel carrying over a kilogram of heroin which was booked for Canada, said a statement.

It said the raid was conducted in a Korangi area on an intelligence report suggesting that a parcel carrying the drug was being sent overseas in the garb of a regular consignment.

“Officials of ANF police station-2 Korangi, Karachi, on a tip-off reached the office of a private courier service, intercepted the suspicious parcel and recovered drugs concealed in ladies’ fancy suits,” said an official of the force.

“The parcel was booked on the national identity card of Mirza Maqsood, son of M. Mirza Fazal Hussain, resident of Karachi, for Nesto Riza, resident of Canada. Further investigation has been initiated by the ANF,” he added.

In another action, the Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, claimed to have arrested two suspected street criminals from Model Colony, said a statement. Both the suspects, the paramilitary force said, were wanted in several cases, including street crimes and robbery.

They said the suspects named Dil Murad, aka Mahmood, and Tauseef, aka Mushki, were arrested after a raid in Model Colony area. Illegal arms, ammunition, cash and valuables were seized from them.

",2019-01-16,"KARACHI: Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry suggested on Tuesday that the PPP itself remove Syed Murad Ali Shah from office for “facilitating corruption”; otherwise the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf would take “practical” measures for bringing the change that he said was imminent.

He also termed the PPP-led Sindh government “occupation of Sindh”.

The minister arrived in Karachi for a daylong visit. He spent a busy day, met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, chaired a meeting of party leaders and legislators from Sindh and held talks with leaders of coalition parties.

Assures MQM-P that promises made at the time of govt formation will be fulfilled

Amid different engagements, Mr Chaudhry maintained the same tone and sounded firm on his party’s stance against the PPP-led Sindh government.

“The PPP has actually occupied Sindh,” he said while talking to reporters at Karachi airport. “We support the democratic system and that’s why we want to give them [PPP leadership] time so they take an initiative and take resignation from Murad Ali Shah. If they don’t take action then we would be bound to take practical measures for the change that’s imminent and definitely would be witnessed by the people of Sindh.”

He accused CM Shah of “facilitating” corruption and wrongdoings of former president Asif Ali Zardari, his sister Faryal Talpur and private business conglomerate Omni Group, which he said had taken out a Rs54 billion loan from the Sindh Bank with the support of Mr Shah.

“The PTI stands with the people of Sindh whose money had been found in the banks of Dubai and London instead of [being spent] on them. The wave of change, which has been witnessed by other provinces, would now be seen in Sindh. It is the right of the people of Sindh to become part of the change,” said the information minister.

He also claimed that he was approached by PPP legislators from Sindh, who wanted a change in the province and were looking towards the PTI for development in Sindh.

Asks why NAB not arresting Zardari

Later in the day, he told reporters at the residence of PTI’s Haleem Adil Shaikh that he was surprised as to why the National Accountability Bureau was not arresting Mr Zardari, Ms Talpur and CM Shah despite the fact that their names had appeared in the report of joint investigation team as “key suspects”.

“It’s quite unfortunate that the performance of NAB is not satisfactory and it’s moving at a slow pace,” he said. “Mr Zardari and Faryal Talpur have made the people of Sindh hostage while Murad Ali Shah facilitated all their wrongdoings despite holding a key office in the province and all this is documented in the JIT report. Despite all these facts [they] are not arrested yet, which is quite surprising.”

Visits MQM-P head office

Later, he visited the temporary headquarters of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan in Bahadurabad, where he discussed implementation on several decisions made between the two coalition partners a few months ago.

The federal minister brushed aside the impression of any dispute or disagreement between the two sides while reiterating the “political importance of the MQM-P”.

“MQM is a political reality and one of [the] key coalition partners of the PTI government,” Mr Chaudhry told reporters after the meeting. “In today’s meeting, we have discussed and reviewed the memorandum of understanding which we signed at the time of formation of the government. Several points of the MoU have already been executed while others will also meet the same fate soon.”

Representing the MQM-P, deputy convener Kanwar Naveed Jameel reminded the federal minister of promises of funds from the Centre for a public university in Hyderabad and other development schemes in urban Sindh.

The AJK premier maintained that his government had taken serious stock of environmental and economic impact of NJHP that emerged after its commissioning. “We constituted a committee of the heads of all parliamentary parties, apart from convening a conference of all stakeholders, including senior political figures from Muzaffarabad,” he said, adding that these steps had led the federal government to constitute the committee.

Mr Haider said the NJHP was a national project and the Kashmiris had always offered sacrifices in the interest of Pakistan.

“We will continue to do so in future because a strong and prosperous Pakistan is the nucleus of our hopes and aspirations,” he said, expressing the hope that the federal government would provide full support for mitigation of environmental and other issues in the light of the report, prepared by its committee.

He informed the house that the reservations about Kohala Hydropower Project had also been conveyed to the federal government and he was hopeful that those would also be addressed.

The AJK premier rubbished Indian government’s allegation that Pakistan was non-serious in dialogue as the ‘biggest lie’, and said Delhi had always used dialogue as a ploy to kill time and defuse international pressure.

Over the past seven decades, there had been numerous sessions of dialogue between the two sides, but India never showed seriousness to make the process meaningful and result-oriented, he said.

He seized the opportunity to praise Nawaz Sharif, saying his services for strengthening democracy in Pakistan were invaluable.

",2019-01-16,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court will take up on Jan 21 appeals filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against the acquittal of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in the Flagship Investment reference and for enhancement of his sentence from seven years to 14 years in the Al-Azizia reference.

A two-judge IHC bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani will also hear an appeal of Mr Sharif against his conviction in the Al-Azizia reference as well as a petition seeking suspension of the sentence in this reference the same day.

An accountability court had on Dec 24 last year convicted Mr Sharif in the Al-Azizia/Hill Metal Establishment reference, sentenced him to seven years in prison and fined him Rs1.5 billion and $25 million. Accountability court judge Mohammad Arshad Malik, however, acquitted the former prime minister in the Flagship Investment reference.

Mr Sharif’s appeal argued that certain observations made by the accountability court judge were against the “principles governing administration of criminal justice in Pakistan, and of the principle of fair trial as guaranteed to all citizens of the country by Article 10-A of the Constitution”. It pointed out that the judge had used a word “beneficial owner” for the accused despite the fact that this word was never mentioned in the National Accountability Ordinance.

On the other hand, NAB argued in its appeal that the accountability court did not consider evidence in the Flagship Investment reference and in the Al-Azizia reference. The bureau argued that the court took a lenient view and awarded seven-year sentence to the former premier, instead of maximum 14 years.

",2019-01-15,"Four policemen have been suspended for consuming an energy drink during a raid by law enforcement personnel on a sheesha bar in Karachi's DHA neighbourhood, a police statement said.

A team of South district police — reportedly led by Clifton SP Suhai Aziz — had on Sunday (January 13) carried out a raid on the Morocco Lounge café located in DHA Phase V, on reports that a sheesha bar was being operated inside the facility, a press release issued by SSP South Pir Muhammad Shah said.

The SSP tried to clarify that Suhai Aziz was not in charge of a ""private police party"".

According to the statement, a large quantity of ""unhealthy"" tobacco sheesha was recovered during the raid.

Police had also registered a case against the owners of the café for ""secretly"" operating a sheesha bar.

During the raid, four policemen had consumed Red Bull energy drink that was available at the restaurant, SSP Shah said.

Footage obtained by DawnNewsTV showed a number of policemen reaching into a mini fridge and retrieving what appeared to be cans of drinks. At least one cop was also caught munching on what appeared to be a snack.

""Departmental action"" was taken against the four police officials, and they have since been suspended, the police statement said.

Meanwhile, Sindh Inspector General of Police Dr Syed Kaleem Imam took notice of media reports regarding the police party ""allegedly torturing citizens and holding [them] hostage"" during the raid at the restaurant. TV footage showed armed policemen dragging and shoving a couple of men, who appeared to be employees.

According to a press release, the Sindh police chief has directed the SSP South to immediately submit a detailed inquiry report into the incident.

SSP Shah in his statement said the running of sheesha bars was ""not permitted in any condition"" in the district South, including Clifton division.

",2019-01-15,"Tragedy befell a home on Rawalpindi's Sixth Road where preparations were taking place for a wedding, as a fire erupted and burned alive five women, including the bride-to-be.

The victims were identified as the 24-year-old bride, Sana; 14-year-old Hina; 20-year-old Hafza; 25-year-old Manahil; and 22-year-old Nayna.

Four women died on the spot while the fifth women, who had received serious burn wounds, succumbed to her injuries at the hospital, DawnNewsTV reported. The bodies have been handed over to the families of the deceased.

Eyewitnesses told DawnNewsTV that the fire broke out on the ground floor of the house and moved upwards to engulf the upper storey.

The homeowner, Malik Abdul Ghani, while narrating the incident to DawnNewsTV, laid the blame on rescue services: ""They did not arrive timely and as a result five women, including my daughter are now dead.""

The aggrieved father said his daughter was due to be married on Thursday, whereas today, a mehendi ceremony was going to take place.

When the fire broke out, between 40 and 50 guests were present within the home. Some had to jump out from the upper floor in order to save their lives.

According to New Town Assistant Superintendent Police (ASP) Ziauddin, the source of the fire remains a mystery and it is being investigated whether the cause was a short circuit in the wiring, a gas leakage, or if it was a case of arson. He said that to this end, the Punjab Forensic Science Agency was also being consulted.

Former MPA Raja Hanif, an eyewitness to the tragedy, alleged that the rescue services arrived late and that the first fire truck to have arrived at the scene ""did not have any water"".

Rescue services official Farooq Butt denied the allegations and said the rescue team had reached the residence six minutes after being alerted of the fire. However, they were ""subjected to violence"" which delayed rescue efforts and prevented the team from controlling the fire timely.

""Every individual present at the site of the incident was in a fit of rage and our operations were continuously interrupted,"" he said, adding that ""even then, due to their tireless efforts, the fire brigade team managed to control the fire"".

Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed also visited the site of the incident and extended his condolences to the family.

He said the ""entire house was constructed from wood, which is why the fire spread so quickly"".

The minister said that investigations were underway and that strict action would be taken if any negligence is discovered.

""I have been informed that the fire brigade tanker did not have any water.

In a previous hearing of the Benazir Bhutto murder case on December 15, the court had issued arrest warrants for FIA special prosecutor Khwaja Imtiaz and FIA Station House Officer (SHO) Azmat Mahmood for failing to appear in court and not providing details of Musharraf's assets. They were again summoned on January 15 (today).

The duo, who were present in the court today, apologised to judge Muhammad Asghar Khan for their absence in previous court proceedings. Subsequently, their arrest warrants were cancelled.

The special prosecutor provided details of Musharraf's farmhouse, five plots and eight bank accounts to the court.

Judge Khan expressed displeasure at a significant reduction in the amounts in the frozen bank accounts of Musharraf — the main accused in the Benazir murder case as per a challan submitted by the FIA in 2013.

The FIA in its four-point charge sheet had accused Musharraf of hatching a conspiracy, in connection with the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto outside Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007.

""How is there a reduction in the bank accounts from 2016?"" the court asked the prosecutor, seeking a reply explaining the activity in the frozen bank accounts.

""Why is there a difference in details of the bank accounts provided two years ago and the current amount in the accounts?"" the judge questioned.

",2019-01-15,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Bahria Town's offer to deposit Rs250 billion to avoid legal proceedings for illegally acquiring land for its projects in Karachi, Islamabad and Murree.

An implementation bench of the apex court was hearing a case pertaining to the implementation on a May 4, SC verdict against Bahria Town. Under the order, the court had barred M/s Bahria Town Karachi from selling any plot or constructed apartment in the housing scheme on the outskirts of the port city, declaring the grant of land to the Malir Develop­ment Authority and its exchange with the land of the private land developers illegal and void ab initio.

At the outset of today's hearing, a counsel on behalf of Bahria Town offered to submit Rs200 billion to waive off charges against the real estate developer.

Justice Azmat Saeed, who was heading the three-member bench, reminded the counsel that a fine of Rs285 billion had been imposed on Bahria Town in 2004. ""If the fine money is increased by 40 per cent, it will amount to Rs300bn.""

Take a look: Bahria Town Karachi: Greed unlimited

Justice Saeed noted that three separate verdicts had been passed against Bahria Town, so it should make ""separate and reasonable"" offers for its projects in Karachi, Islamabad and Murree.

At this, Bahira Town's counsel increased the offer to Rs250bn.

""This is not a suitable way to deal with [the apex court],"" Justice Saeed said, reprimanding the lawyer. ""We may ask the National Accountability Bureau to file a reference.""

The counsel sought one week's time to file a reply. Justice Saeed granted the plea and directed Bahria Town to submit written offers in all the three cases.

""Our mistake was not that big,"" the counsel argued.

""Mistake is supposed to be of one or two kanals, not of thousands of acres,"" the judge replied.

The implementation bench was formed after the court had dropped the review petitions filed against its May 4 judgement barring Bahria Town Karachi from selling any plots or constructed apartments.

In its May 4 judgement, the court had declared the grant of land to the Malir Development Authority (MDA) and its exchange with the land of Bahria Town illegal and void. It had also directed NAB to continue its probe into the matters of the developer.

",2019-01-15,"A joint investigation team (JIT) on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that ousted premier Nawaz Sharif had illegally allotted 14,398 acres of Waqf property attached to the shrine of Hazrat Baba Farid-ud-Din Masud Ganj Shakar in Pakpattan to Dewan Ghulam Qutab during his tenure as Punjab chief minister in 1986.

Sharif has been accused of illegally allotting the shrine's land during his tenure as chief minister in violation of a high court order after ordering the withdrawal of a notification dated Dec 17, 1969.

The SC-mandated JIT formed to probe the allegations against Sharif submitted a report on its findings during today's hearing.

Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Director General Hussain Asghar, who was heading the JIT, told the court that Sharif had, in addition to the Pakpattan shrine land, allotted land in Hujra Shah Muqeem along with that of the shrine of Hafiz Jamalullah Multani.

Asghar told the court that an investigation report prepared in 2015 had held the then chief minister responsible. However, the chief minister's name was excluded in a second report that was submitted in 2016. The JIT, concluding that then chief minister did not have the authority to transfer the land, recommended that that land be retrieved and criminal proceedings be initiated against Sharif, then secretary to chief minister Syed Javed Iqbal Bukhari, the legal heirs of Deewan Ghulam Qutub Din, assistant administrator of Auqaf Pakpattan during 1969 and 1986 as well as the patwaris of the area ""where these irregularities and illegalities were committed"".

Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar who was heading the three-member bench hearing the case today said that ""times have changed and a third report will not be prepared"".

""Why was this land allotted illegally?"" the chief justice inquired, warning that ""no one will be able to escape if an investigation is launched"".

Sharif's counsel Barrister Munawar Iqbal said that the former premier had rejected the allegations earlier.

""You're playing the role of [the person] more loyal to the king than the king himself,"" Justice Nisar remarked. ""We may order the Anti-Corruption Establishment to file a complaint.""

The chief justice ordered the Punjab government and Nawaz Sharif to submit a response to the JIT report within two weeks.

",2019-01-15,"Two suspected members of the militant Islamic State group allegedly linked to the 2013 abduction of former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's son, Ali Haider Gilani, were killed in a pre-dawn raid on a 'militant hideout' in Faisalabad on Tuesday, a Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official said.

CTD official Rai Tahir identified the two militants as Adeel Hafeez and Usman Haroon. He said both were killed during an intense shootout in the raid conducting by security officials.

Tahir said officials had, in the past, foiled other attacks the pair had plotted, adding that they were also behind the killing of two intelligence officials in recent years as well as other high-profile crimes.

The two militants were also linked to the 2011 Al Qaeda abduction of an American development worker, Warren Weinstein, the official said. Weinstein, who was taken from Lahore, was accidentally killed in a United States drone strike in 2015 on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He provided no specific information about the role the two had in Weinstein's case.

The American worker's accidental death was announced by Washington in 2015. President Barack Obama at the time said he took full responsibility for US counter-terror missions and offered his condolences to families of the hostages.

After the Sept 11 attacks in the United States, Washington aggressively targeted militant hideouts in neighbouring Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal regions, killing local and foreign militants. Pakistan considers US drone strikes a violation of its sovereignty, while the US accuses Pakistan of providing safe havens for militants. Pakistan has always denied the charge, saying it acts against militants without discrimination.

Speaking to reporters after the nearly two-hour-long meeting, Shahbaz said the opposition leaders had decided to form a committee to devise a joint strategy and deal with the government on various issues.

The committee, which according to Shahbaz will have representation from all opposition parties, will also be responsible for holding negotiations with the government on the issue of an extension in the tenure of military courts. ""The combined opposition will adopt whatever path is in the national interest,"" he added.

The leader of the opposition also criticised the ""worst incompetence"" of the PTI government and once again termed as ""cronyism"" the government's move to award the Mohmand dam contract to a consortium led by Descon, which he alleged was owned by a sitting adviser to the prime minister.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari — who attended the meeting along with his father, former president Asif Ali Zardari — in his remarks said the opposition's human and democratic rights were under attack from all sides by the government, but the opposition leaders were ""not ready to compromise"" on these two rights.

""The opposition has today decided on a very good strategy to form a committee and have a joint opposition inside the parliament as well as outside,"" the PPP chairman said.

Meanwhile, asked whether the opposition parties would come together in the shape of an alliance, Zardari responded: ""The union HAS taken place.""

NA session suspended after ruckus

Earlier on Tuesday, business in the lower house was disrupted again after the opposition lodged a strong protest against the deputy speaker's decision not to hold a re-vote when an opposition MNA introduced a bill pertaining to the quota of judges in the Islamabad High Court.

The deputy speaker returned to the House after an hour to announce adjournment of the session. It will resume tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11am. — DawnNewsTV

JUI-F MNA Aliya Kamran had moved a bill seeking an increase in the number of judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) from six to 10, and a quota accommodating all the provinces on IHC benches.

Parliamentary Secretary for Law Maleeka Bokhari opposed the bill, but Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri held a verbal vote and subsequently rejected the bill after it appeared to have been voted against.

Kamran then challenged the vote and the deputy speaker ordered a headcount. The headcount revealed that 96 MNAs opposed the bill, while 94 were in favour of it. Therefore, the NA decided against the move.

Members of the opposition gathered in front of Suri's dais, asking him to order another vote on the bill but the deputy speaker rejected the demand and suspended House proceedings.

The deputy speaker returned to the House after an hour to announce adjournment of the session. It will resume tomorrow (Wednesday) at 11am.

Earlier today, Prime Minister Imran Khan took to Twitter to lash out at the opposition for disrupting National Assembly proceedings by staging regular walkouts.

The prime minister said that the repeated walkouts indicated that this was ""the only function they (opposition) intend to perform"".

",2019-01-15,"Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry warned on Tuesday that if the PPP is unable to bring change to Sindh and the chief minister does not resign, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government ""will need to take practical steps"".

Chaudhry, while speaking to reporters upon arrival in Karachi, explained that the government wants ""the PPP to bring change themselves"", and for a new chief minister to take the place of Murad Shah, a senior PPP leader who was named in the joint investigation team's report in the fake accounts case.

""We want to first give them an opportunity [to bring change]. If this opportunity is not availed, and they do not take advantage of it, and Murad Shah does not resign, then we will certainly need to take practical steps here,"" he said.

When asked about the possibility of the PTI forming a forward bloc in the PPP to remove the provincial government, Chaudhry responded that any person who carries the pain of the people of Sindh in his heart will want change in the province, no matter what party he belongs to.

He said that even 'serious' members of the PPP wanted change, adding that when this issue began, PPP members had themselves contacted the PTI and asked it to step forward for change.

""It is also a right of the people of Sindh to see the wave of change that the three other provinces have seen, that all of Pakistan has seen. It is the right of the people of Sindh that they become part of this change,"" he added.

The federal minister pointed out that Sindh had not contributed to the National Finance Commission award for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) although the ""other provinces and the federal government had given their share for its development"".

The PTI-run Federal, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments had decided on Jan 4 to jointly provide the equivalent of 3pc of the federal divisible pool for uplifting Fata after its merger with KP.

Chaudhry claimed that although the PPP paints itself as a ""vision of democracy"", when the time for action came, it disassociated itself from Fata.

He alleged that Sindh's money would ""not be spent on the poor people"" of the province. ""It will go to the Omni Group and into branches of the Zardari Gropu of companies. The painful thing is that Sindh's funds are being spent in London and Dubai.""

He claimed that those who are ""closest to the people will talk about change"", and that a large majority of the PPP MPAs would side with the PTI.

The tenure of Zardari's monarchy has come to an end, similarly, the Sindh's lease to Omni group has also expired, the minister said.

""I am astonished that NAB still hasn't arrested Asif, Faryal and Murad Ali Shah despite the fact that the watchdog has to complete the probe in two months.""

He alleged that the ""residents of Bilawal House"" and ""the man in CM House [in Karachi]"" are beneficiary of the fake accounts. He also accused the watchdog of showing leniency.

Chaudhry said no doubt the 18th Amendment has several positive impacts, including devolution of power which enabled transfer of large funds to provinces. ""But the point is, where did these funds go?""

""They [PPP] are demanding funds form themselves and not for the people of Sindh. Whenever the rulers in Sindh are asked about accountability, suddenly the democracy becomes ‘vulnerable’,"" the minister remarked.

PTI-PPP tussle heats up

A tussle between the PPP and PTI over money laundering and the fake bank accounts case has heated up in recent days, with the ruling party in Sindh accusing the Centre of attempting to dislodge the provincial government and warning it of dire consequences if any attempt is made to arrest top party cadre.

Chaudhry's two-day trip to Sindh scheduled for December was shelved after Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar's observations during an earlier hearing of the fake accounts case indicated that the PTI was trying to topple the PPP government.

Chaudhry was allegedly tasked by the prime minister to meet leaders of political parties apart from the PPP during his earlier trip to Sindh and seek their support for dislodging the PPP government.

The information minister, however, has denied that his party wishes to dislodge the PPP government. ""We do not want to dislodge the PPP government in Sindh but want to forge consensus on the demand for resignation of Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to ensure fair trial of Asif Ali Zardari and company,” he had said earlier, adding that the PTI had no intention to impose governor's rule in Sindh or repeal the 18th Amendment.

The information minister had explained during an earlier press conference that his visit had been cancelled by Prime MInister Imran Khan to reject the impression that the Centre wanted to topple the Sindh government.

PPP is the majority party in the Sindh Assembly with 99 seats while the PTI and its allies have a total of 64 seats. The PTI requires 18 more members to outnumber the PPP to form its government in the province. However, it is believed that it would be a hard nut to crack to defeat the PPP in the provincial assembly as the party enjoys a formidable position in the province since long and has been in office there for over a decade.",dawn,"['information', 'minister', 'fawad', 'chaudhry', 'warned', 'tuesday', 'ppp', 'unable', 'bring', 'change', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'resign', 'pakistan',

",2019-01-15,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday in its verdict in a suo motu case on the increasing population said that the government, civil society and religious scholars should all take steps to tackle the issue.

A three-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Ijazul Ahsan, was hearing the case. Population control is the latest campaign the SC has extended its support to.

According to the 2017 census, which was held after a gap of 19 years, the country’s population is approximately 207,774,520 living in 32,205,111 households. The results show that Pakistan has moved up the ladder becoming the fifth most populous nation only behind India, China, the United States and Indonesia. Top government officials have decided to reduce the population growth rate of 2.4 per cent per annum to 1.5pc.

The SC in its verdict today observed that an increasing population is a stress on the country's resources and likened the growth to an explosion.

""We need a campaign to decrease the population,"" the court said. ""It is a question of the future of our coming generations.""

""The entire nation must stand united on the matter of population planning,"" said chief justice Nisar, who has termed unbridled population growth as the ""most disastrous issue"" for Pakistan.

In yesterday's hearing, the court was told by the health secretary that a demographic survey is conducted every five years. The last one was in 2018 and its results bore little difference compared to the survey before that, the secretary told the bench.

The chief justice asked about progress made on its earlier orders, to which the secretary had responded that a report was submitted.

""Every three months, the court will assess the implementation of the report,"" the chief justice said, referring to recommendations made by a task force that had been set up to probe the matter.

",2019-01-15,"Writers, journalists and civil society activists gathered outside the Lahore Press Club on Monday in protest against the ban on Nandita Das film Manto.

“Manto was screened all over the world and it won an award in Bangladesh but it was banned in the writer’s own country,” lamented journalist and secretary general of Manto Memorial Society Saeed Ahmed.

He said Manto himself was not treated well in Pakistan and when he came to Lahore after the Partition, his entry was banned into the radio station. The ‘new Pakistan’ under the PTI government was treating him the same way as he was treated in old Pakistan 10 years back, he said, appealing to the government to lift the ban on the movie. He said it was a countrywide protest as similar demonstrations against the ban on Manto were being held in Karachi and Peshawar.

Calling for the freedom of expression, painter Salima Hashmi said: “Manto was kept deprived of this right in his life and after so many years, he is still facing the same oppression.”

She said Manto was the most read Urdu prose writer in the world, condemning the attitude of the government towards him.

Veteran journalist Hussain Naqi said Manto was the most-read and most-translated Pakistani writer who was known all over the world and banning the film made on his life could not be justified from any point of view. He also condemned the alleged government action against the Manto festival scheduled to be held at Alhamra Art Centre.

“One of the best works on Partition and subsequent years are in the form of Manto’s short stories which are as important as poetry of Faiz Sahib,” he added.

Abdul Waheed of the Progressive Writers Association said the ban on film showed Manto was as unacceptable for the state institution as he was 70 years back which exposed the stagnation of society. He said the nation had not progressed socially, morally and intellectually.

Farooq Tariq of the Awami Workers Party praised Nandita Das’s film on Manto, saying the protest was against the ban on the movie that was screened across the world except in Pakistan. Writer Husssain Majrooh also spoke.

",2019-01-15,"THE PTI-run Federal, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments decided on Jan 4 to jointly provide equivalent to three per cent of the federal divisible pool for uplifting the erstwhile Fata region following its merger with KP.

The decision is stated to have been prompted by the delay in formation of the National Finance Commission (NFC) and expected reluctance by Sindh and Balochistan to tinker with the 7th NFC award. When Fata was a federal territory, provinces had opposed diversion of funds from the NFC’s divisible pool to finance the region’s development needs.

Stipulated to be enforced from the next financial year, the decision is projected to raise Rs108 billion, including Punjab’s contribution of Rs38.3bn The ad-hoc decision indicates that it will be tough for the PTI government to forge a consensus for the next NFC award.

Since the PTI has come into power, the Sindh government has been criticising some of the federal government’s proposals for exceeding the constitutional limits.

On Jan 5, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah told the prime minister’s Special Assistant on Power Shahzad Qasim, who called on him in Karachi, that the decision of the Federal Cabinet Committee on Energy to reduce the life of solar and wind projects from 20 to 15 years was illegal and unconstitutional. He pointed out that the Council of Common Interests was the only constitutional forum to decide electricity policy issues and sought withdrawal of the decision.

In this age of networking, unilateral and arbitrary actions can deliver, at best, only partially

During the same week, the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Reforms demanded that Rs9bn donations collected for two mega-dams be diverted for building small and medium ones for water-starved Balochistan to support agriculture and livestock development and create job opportunities in the province.

The panel felt the collected amount was meagre, considering the cost of the Diamer-Bhasha dam was estimated at Rs1 trillion and Mohmand dam at Rs300bn. With the same amount, the committee estimated that the number of dams planned for Balochistan could be increased from 100 to 500.

Unlike big dams for which foreign loans are required, the Rs9bn could best be invested in the province to bring virgin lands under plough and boost output of fruits and meat for exports.

The building of the mega-dams has also been opposed by Sindh where the provincial government has announced its intention to set up two desalination plants for Karachi, owing to water scarcity, both for household use and irrigation purposes. Sindh wants a policy shift to modern methods of water conservation including increased usage of drip and sprinkler systems.

Even within the ranks of the PTI and its coalition partners, there seems to be no consensus on the party’s heavy agenda.

The PML-Q , an important coalition partner, shares views with PML-N on the creation of Bahawalpur province and the party does not subscribe to the creation of South Punjab as envisaged by PTI.

Finally, the PTI’s recent perceived move to impose governor rule in Sindh and destabilise Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah’s government was not supported by coalition partner MQM-P and fellow traveller Sindh Democratic Alliance leader Pir Saheb Pagara. PTI has failed to recognise the sway of participatory federal democracy over the country’s politics after the 18th Constitutional Amendment.

A second mini-budget within a short span of time, due later this month, reflects PTI’s ad hoc-ism that is not a part of an implementable long-term plan

To quote Fitch,’political headwinds are growing in Pakistan’ which, it may be added, requires consensus building for resolving agitating problems so far defying solutions. A second mini-budget within a short span of time, due later this month, reflects PTI’s ad hoc-ism that is not a part of an implementable long-term plan.

Official data bears this out. During July-December 2018, the net dollar reserves of the State Bank have fallen from $10.2bn to $7.3bn and those held by commercial banks are stagnant at around $6.5bn.

Simultaneously, budgetary borrowings have soared by 86pc to Rs722bn owing to a shortfall of Rs112bn in targeted federal tax revenue and surge in non-development spending. Though the trade gap is reducing, the increase in exports and home remittances are not fast enough to plug the hole in external sector accounts to a comfortable level anytime soon. There is little prospect for an export rebound, says an international research agency.

As it is, Prime Minister Imran Khan has taken over the reins of the government in difficult times. He has to grapple with enormous domestic and external challenges.

No doubt the PTI manifesto promises the nation wide ranging, virtuous reforms, but for that to happen, economic agents, bureaucracy, sub-federating units, district governments and farmers have to be energised with widest political and civil society support.

The entire nation needs to be mobilised on a practical common agenda and a coherent strategy for resolving deep-seated problems facing the country. In this age of networking, unilateral and arbitrary actions can deliver, at best, only partially.

Mr Khan has succeeded in securing financial support from Saudi Arabia ($6.2bn), UAE ( expected $6.2bn) and trade financing ($1.5bn) from the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation amounting to $13.9bn. Another $2bn has been pledged by China raising the total expected borrowings to $15.9bn in six months.

But the festering problem still remains: there is no significant boost in foreign exchange earnings insight to service ballooning external debts. External sector pressures are not expected to go away.

And business confidence is sinking in a rudderless economy despite Mr Khan’s pledge to provide an enabling environment for wealth creation.

78,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457688/are-the-states-xenophobic-policies-contributing-to-pakistans-international-isolation,"Are the state's xenophobic policies contributing to Pakistan's international isolation?
",2019-01-15,"XENOPHOBIA is unfounded fear of foreigners. It often results in actions against them that defy logic. It occurs globally, with both developing and developed countries experiencing it. And that seems like an incomplete list.

But there is a difference between ordinary people and the state exhibiting xenophobia. The former causes much damage too, like attacks on foreigners. But given the huge powers that states enjoy, state xenophobia can cause much greater harm to foreigners as they adopt misplaced policies to eliminate external threats. The US state xenophobia under Trump harms both foreigners and US interests.

Also read: The age of xenophobia

Xenophobia is not new to Pakistani society. But its state institutions have often adopted xenophobic policies, especially in the last few months. Pakistan clearly faces external threats and espionage, like most states globally. But it also faces major opportunities in interacting externally, including with those states from which it experiences threats. Smart states balance the threats and opportunities by basing concerns about foreigners on strong evidence and adopting calibrated responses that minimise the threats but not the opportunities. Unfortunately, such smart analysis seems missing from our responses in many cases.

Our institutions have often adopted shortsighted policies.

Only recently, Pakistan expelled 18 INGOs without assigning any specific reasons on a case-by-case basis. The backlash against INGOs originates from the 2011 allegations that one INGO supported Shakeel Afridi in conducting a vaccination campaign to track down Osama bin Laden. No proof was presented of the INGO’s role. The non-calibrated nature of the action against INGOs can be gauged by the fact that this particular INGO has not been expelled but 18 others having nothing to do with that incident have been.

Explore: Pressure on INGOs

The official press release vaguely refers to a failure to meet registration requirements and involvement in unauthorised activities. But apparently, none of the expelled INGOs were given any specific reasons about where they went wrong. Write-ups supporting the expulsion also mention vague ‘reasons’, such as their involvement in surveys and geo-tagging. These are standard development-sector practices followed globally by INGOs and even well-equipped state agencies. Expulsion is an extreme step to be taken only if there is concrete proof that an INGO was involved in illegal practices. So far, there is little proof that such a rule of law-based outlook was employed.

Finally, there is the provision that all expelled INGOs can reapply after six months. Why would the state entertain their applications just after six months if solid proof of wrongdoing by them was found? By expelling them on flimsy grounds, we have unnecessarily lost millions of dollars of funding, thousands of jobs and international repute.

Deeming dual citizens a security risk, a recent court verdict has asked the state to develop laws to restrict their hiring in the bureaucracy. Legal minds ask if it is the job of courts to identify security risks. But even if the executive makes such a review, it should be based on solid proof.

Dual nationality: a conflict of interest for bureaucrats?

Dual citizens have been working in the bureaucracy for several decades. How many incidents have there been of them facilitating foreign states at the expense of Pakistan? Foreign states can easily bribe willing ordinary Pakistani citizens to do so despite the ban. Expat Pakistanis with their wealth, education and goodwill for Pakistan are an asset. Both the executive and courts frequently appeal to them to donate funds in times of financial crunch.

Another verdict has declared Indian content on TV a cultural threat. Again, some legal minds ask whether the judiciary should be analysing cultural threats. And how would even the executive define and measure cultural threat? The frequency of objectionable scenes in Indian movies has increased with time. But that is an issue more with English movies, and simple censorship of specific offensive scenes rather than a blanket ban on all Indian content would seem a more calibrated response.

Rational states recognise that ordinary families and communities are quite capable of shielding impressionable young minds from cultural exposures they deem harmful and that the blunt use of state bans in the cultural arena is unnecessary. There is clearly a high demand for Indian stuff in Pakistan and vice versa. So, similarly, the Indian ban on Pakistani artists is highly deplorable.

State policies are expected to be based on careful analysis and facts. When states also start acting like impulsive citizens, the space for rationality and tolerance reduces fast in the country. While world powers have deplorably contributed to isolating Pakistan, our own ill-conceived reactions are making us even more isolated and paranoid.

",2019-01-15,"AS things move along, the need for greater transparency and disclosure on what exactly the government is signing onto is growing.

The eighth Joint Cooperation Committee meeting on CPEC between Pakistani and Chinese government delegations was held in December, but to this day, there is very little known about the details of what the government of Pakistan has consented to do.

Read more: What do Pakistan and China want from CPEC going forward?

In addition, we have seen $2bn land in the State Bank as a ‘deposit’, following a visit to Saudi Arabia by the prime minister accompanied by a high-powered ministerial entourage, with promises of another billion to come soon, and a ‘deferred payment’ facility to underwrite a portion of the country’s oil imports.

Yet, not a word has been uttered about what has been promised in return. Likewise, we are now hearing of another $3bn worth of ‘deposits’ to be made by the UAE, but once again, there is not a word about what is expected in return. No details have even been released about the terms on which these ‘deposits’ have come, whether on their tenure or return.

Now we are hearing of a massive investment from Saudi Arabia to be made in an ‘oil city’ in Gwadar. What exactly is going on here, many wish to ask.

Foreign investment is welcome in Pakistan, but in most cases it comes under a policy framework that is transparently known, has been debated in cabinet at least, and with the terms available to all. Some sort of a bilateral framework between two countries exclusively is also fine, but it should be known to all what exactly is being built, what concessions are being granted, how Pakistan’s long-term economic interests are being served, and so on.

Foreign investment that creates jobs, transfers skills and imparts dynamism to Pakistan’s economy and spurs its markets is welcome. But investment that seeks to create a transshipment enclave, or provides exclusive access rights and privileges to one group of investors only is of debatable merit.

When government ministers are asked for details, they refuse to entertain the request on the grounds that the other party — whether China or Saudi Arabia — prefers discretion in this matter.

Discretion is fine and has its place in deal-making of the sort that is under way between the states, but since sprawling Pakistani interests are involved, transparency and disclosure requirements must not be jettisoned.

The feeling right now appears to be that the government, in its desperation to avoid the stringent terms of an IMF programme, is signing every dotted line that is placed before it by foreign powers such as China and Saudi Arabia, in return for a bailout that will last a few months at best.

This is not the kind of policymaking that the PTI promised the country in the run-up to the election.

80,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457562/mughal-era-stepwell-faces-deterioration,"Mughal-era stepwell faces deterioration
",2019-01-15,"TAXILA: Due to lack of maintenance, a 17th century stepwell in Wah’s Sher Shah Park, locally known as Losar Baoli, is facing deterioration and the retaining wall to the west of the well has started to crumble.

The well was one of many constructed in the 17th century by the Mughals along the Grand Trunk Road to provide fresh drinking water to travellers. Such wells were constructed every three miles.

The wells were 100ft by 6ft and had a main entrance. Unlike the common method of pulling out water with a bucket tied to a pulley, these wells had stairs which had a platform at three different depths so that people could stop to fetch water at various levels.

The wells provided water to travellers and their horses.

The wells became obsolete with time and many do not exist now. One of the wells was included in the Sher Shah Park when it was established.

Quaid-i-Azam University Taxila Institute of Asia Civilisation’s former director Dr Mohammad Ashraf Khan said stepwells were first introduced by Ashoka in the third century BC in the region to facilitate pilgrims and travellers along highways.

He added that the route used to connect the Valley of Ganges with the northwest region of the subcontinent.

Dr Khan said such wells were constructed and maintained by the Mughals and that they were also used by their armies.

“These wells and inns were built to facilitate pilgrims, travellers and armies. Royal messengers and horse riders would stay and rest at Baolies and would replace their horses so they could deliver important letters. Sometimes, the riders were changed as well,” he said.

Officials of the Punjab Department of Archaeology told Dawn that one of the walls of the well collapsed in 1990 and was restored by the authorities.

However, the authorities concerned did not undertake maintenance work which led to the collapse of a major portion of the wall on the western side.

They said that the Punjab government released funds to the Punjab Department of Archaeology’s sub-regional office during the fiscal year 2016-17 for the restoration and the preservation of the site. However the funds lapsed as the department did not execute the project.

Department of Archaeology Deputy Director Irshad Hussain confirmed that the department had gotten funds for the maintenance of the site.

“The funds were not enough to pay for the preservation and restoration of the site so the project was shelved,” he told Dawn.

He added that a partial restoration would not address the issue and that the project will not be executed till the required funds are received.

",2019-01-15,"GUJAR KHAN: Despite a ban, dog fighting remains one of the most popular activities in the Potohar region and an open secret.

Affluent families from Kharian, Bewal, Jabbar, Mirpur and Dhadial spend large sums of money on bull terrier breeding.

A puppy from a bull terrier who has won fights is sold for between Rs50,000 and Rs200,000, according to Chaudhry Khadim, who had come all the way from Mirpur to watch the much-awaited dog fight in Gujar Khan on Sunday.

A buffalo is set aside exclusively for providing milk to the bull terrier, who is also fed pure desi ghee during training.

Bashir Mughal, who hails from Daultala and is famous for breeding bull terriers, told Dawn that one puppy is assigned three trainers. A dog’s routine involves a 10-km jog twice a day to improve its stamina.

Another breeder, Mohammad Zakir, said his dog had recently won a fight and that he has been offered Rs1 million for it but he has refused to sell the dog.

“I bought him in Quetta and love him like family,” he said.

The Sunday fight near Gujar Khan was attended by thousands of people from Punjab, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and even people from outside the country.

The dogs were driven to the venue in cars and were given VIP treatment.

Some of the better known fighter dogs include Bubloo, Moon, Heera, Moti, Doggar, Koka, Shankar, Kaala and Jockey.

Mohammad Bashir, who attends dog fights regularly, told Dawn that some dog owners either rub bitter tasting ointments on their dogs so other dogs would not hold their bite for long, oil so they cannot get a grip and sometimes even poison to kill rival dogs.

That is why two referees are tasked with properly washing the dogs before they are allowed to fight, he said.

Dog fighting has been prohibited by the district administration and the police.

The hosts of these events organise them in secret, deep inside forests and other remote locations. Those attending the event are never given an exact location and are given the address to a neighbouring location.

The matches continue from morning till sunset and are filmed so they can be uploaded on social media, where they are avidly followed.

",2019-01-15,"RAWALPINDI: Eighty pilgrims were stopped from boarding a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight for Umrah because their seats had not been confirmed, but half of them were allowed to travel after their travel agent paid for their tickets.

PIA spokesperson Mashood Tajwar told Dawn that a travel agent from Lahore had booked the pilgrims’ seats but did not pay for their confirmation in time, leading to the cancellation of their bookings.

He added that the travel agency was a defaulter that owed the PIA Rs25 million, but had sought a temporary stay order from a senior civil judge.

The court had also ordered the agency to pay the PIA.

Mr Tajwar said the passengers’ tickets were only cancelled because the travel agent did not pay for them.

Half the pilgrims were allowed to travel after agent paid for their seats

He said the travel agent had also involved a sub-agent who dealt with the pilgrims.

The pilgrims, who were from Lakki Marwat, were to travel from Islamabad to Jeddah on PIA flight PK-741, but were not permitted to board because their seats were not confirmed.

They were told by PIA staff that their bookings were cancelled because their travel agent did not pay for the tickets in time.

Mr Tajwar said 40 of the pilgrims were allowed to travel once the travel agent paid for their tickets.

He blamed the agent for inconveniencing the pilgrims, and claimed the PIA administration’s timely actions

had saved the airline from fraud. PK-741 took off at 8:45am.

Separately, a passenger travelling to Ras Al Khaimah was injured from falling on the escalator while heading to the passenger lounge at Islamabad International Airport.

Sources said Sheikh Mohammad Hussain, 83, slipped and fell down the escalator, injuring his forehead. The passenger received first aid from a Civil Aviation Authorty doctor and was allowed to travel.

",2019-01-15,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development joined the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration in an operation to retrieve 102 kanals in Valley Zone V belonging to the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) that had been occupied since 1999.

Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Overseas Pakistanis Syed Zulfikar Bukhari supervised the operation alongside Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat.

Mr Bukhari told the press: “The writ of the state will be established at all costs and those involved in grabbing land belonging to Pakistani expatriates will be taken to task as per law.”

He added: “We will not tolerate such an illegal activity and in this regard measures are being taken to avoid reoccupation of the state’s land by the mafia.”

Mr Bukhari said a boundary wall will be constructed around the valley and police pickets will be set up as well. The concerned ministry will also ensure that the area is monitored so it cannot be occupied again.

According to a ministry spokesperson, the valley, spread over 5,000 kanals, was approved in 1999 and 90pc of the allotments have already been made.

The retrieved land will also be allotted to overseas Pakistanis based on merit.

Mr Bukhari told this agency that Pakistani

expatriates were constantly raising the issue of their occupied property in the country, and complaints statistics had also shown that this was a major issue facing expats.

In this regard, he said the ministry is planning to set up a fast-track court in the capital to retrieve expatriates’ property from land grabbers. The court aims to provide instant relief to litigants, as the number of such cases is gradually increasing.

“Accordingly, a summary has been submitted to the Ministry of Law and Justice to materialise the initiative during the current year,” he said.

The special court will be designed to ensure the disposal of cases within a month after the admittance of petitions, he said, adding that it will be established after the necessary legislation with full constitutional cover.

Mr Bukhari said both ministries will meet next week to discuss the technical and legal issues facing overseas Pakistanis in the prevailing judicial system and the setting up of the aforementioned court.

The establishment of the court will serve as a pilot project, on the basis of which similar courts would then be set up in other cities, he said.

",2019-01-15,"ISLAMABAD: Two Capital Development Authority (CDA) directorates are at loggerheads over who is responsible for controlling unauthorised construction in the city.

More than a hundred housing societies are operating illegally in Islamabad, and most of them have taken over land reserved for graveyards, schools and other civic amenities, creating problems for people who have built homes there because timely action was not taken against their operators.

In a letter, the housing societies directorate recently asked building control to take action against sponsors of illegal housing schemes and against schemes whose layouts were cancelled.

Pointing out illegal societies in zones II and V and in E-11, the housing societies directorate asked various organisations to take action against housing society operators.

In response, the directorate of building control II on Monday said the issue of housing societies needed to be quelled on solid grounds in a practical way.

List of illegal housing schemes may be referred to DC, spokesperson says

In a letter, Deputy Director Usman Rasheed Khan said that under zoning regulations, after the clearance of the no-objection certificate, every sponsor of a society must seek approval of engineering design and specifications of utility services from the director general planning.

Authorised CDA officers are also to inspect the site during the development of the scheme and record their observations.

The letter stated: “Major issue in housing schemes is that they have developed their scheme/society in complete deviation of approved layout plan and majority of societies has no obtained NOC from CDA. The question now arises that how they have undertaken the infrastructure work without obtaining NOC form the CDA and if they have obtained necessary approval from the CDA then how they developed in complete deviation of approved LOP.”

The construction of buildings comes later, the letter said, adding that if the aforementioned system had been in place “this whole mess would not have been created”.

The official wrote that if the society had been properly supervised by the concerned CDA officers when infrastructure was being developed, ensuring that housing societies and schemes were being developed according to their approved layout plans and no deviations had taken place “then no violation at site would occur”.

The building control letter advised the housing societies directorate to ensure that CDA officers visit schemes that are now in the construction stage to check whether infrastructure is being developed according to engineering standards and, if this system is in place, they would make sure development is carried out according to the approved layout plan.

The letter also referenced various regulations that empower the housing societies directorate to deal with societies that violate layout plans. It added that building control II was established in 2017 to exercise building control in approved housing societies “but unfortunately no requisite staff has yet been posted despite various efforts”.

It added that the understaffed directorate could not carry out fieldwork to check unauthorised construction, and also called for a complete ban on construction in illegal housing societies.

CDA spokesperson Safdar Shah said the list of all illegal housing schemes may be referred to the deputy commissioner for the imposition of section 144 to ban construction in the limits of the Islamabad Capital Territory.

He said the CDA was not restricted to just issued notices, and action has been taken against the operators of several housing societies.

",2019-01-15,"LAHORE: A group of lawyers representing Faisalabad Regional Police Officer Ghulam Mahmood Dogar on Monday audaciously manhandled a man from the opposite party in the court of an additional district and sessions judge hearing an appeal of the RPO against the alleged illegal shifting of his children from Pakistan by his Canadian national wife.

During the hearing, the police officer’s lawyers, who were over a dozen in number, kept abusing and provoking Waseem Ijaz, a guarantor in the children’s custody matter on behalf of their Canadian mother Mirjam Aberras Lahdeaho, despite repeated warnings by AD&SJ Adnan Tariq.

Senior lawyer Hina Jillani represented Mr Ijaz.

Soon after Ms Jillani and Mr Dogar’s counsel Syed Ali Hassan concluded their arguments, the aggressive lawyers pounced upon Mr Ijaz and started roughing him up in the presence of the judge, slapping him in the face and punching him ruthlessly.

The lawyers also manhandled Muhammad Akram, an office-assistant of Ms Jillani and snatched his mobile phone when he tried to make a footage of the violence using its camera.

The judge was shocked to see the violence as his efforts to calm down the lawyers failed.

Ms Jillani and her associates rescued both Mr Ejaz and Mr Akram from the lawyers.

Meanwhile, the judge left for his chamber to dictate the decision of the proceedings.

Earlier, in his arguments, Mr Dogar’s counsel took a plea that the Canadian lady took away the children with her unlawfully.

He said Mr Ejaz had deposited surety bonds before a guardian court when the custody of the minors was given to the mother.

He argued that the guarantor was responsible, under the law, to ensure production of the minors before the court.

He also argued that the court could not proceed on the appeal of the father without the production of the children.

He said Mr Ejaz also possessed Canadian passport and there was a possibility that he would also abscond.

The counsel asked the court to take custody of Mr Ejaz’s passport and also place order placing of his name on exit control list (ECL).

Mr Dogar told the court that the passports of the children were with him but their mother got them removed with “criminal assistance” of the Canadian Embassy.

On the other side, Ms Jillani argued that the guarantor was not supposed to ensure production of the respondent’s children as the surety deposited by him was meant for obtaining guardianship certificate from the guardian court.

She said the court should have issued a notice to the mother of the children instead of issuing arrest warrants of the guarantor.

After hearing the arguments, the judge directed Mr Ejaz to surrender his passport with the court and ensure production of the minors on Jan 24.

Ms Lahdeaho had arrived in Pakistan last year to get custody of her children back, with a claim that her police officer husband brought them from Canada to Pakistan secretly and unlawfully. Mr Dogar had produced the minors – Qasim Dogar (17) and Jaffer Dogar (13) -- before the Lahore High Court after she filed a habeas corpus petition.

Ms Lahdeaho, who also embraced Islam and was given a Muslim name Maryam, said she married Dogar on March 6, 1997, in Lahore and stayed in Pakistan for over 12 years along with three children before moving to Canada as permanent residents in 2009. Zahra Dogar, 19, was their third child.

The lady had flown back to Canada on June 16, 2018, after a guardian court decided the custody of children in her favour.

District Police Officer Mumtaz Ahmed Dev said the police intercepted a car and found two packets of heroin weighing two kilo each from the man and the woman. On complete search of the car, the police seized 26kg heroin that was concealed in its various parts.

The car driver was identified as Muhammad Waqar of Rawalpindi and woman as Sumbal Bibi of Dhudial, Chakwal district. The couple was arrested and booked under the narcotics act.

The DPO claimed it was the biggest cache of heroin in the history of Mianwali. He said both the smugglers were on the way to Karachi.

He said that during a campaign against illegal weapons, a police party, headed by Organised Crime DSP Rana Muhammad Anwar, conducted a raid at Wandha Shaho Khelanwala in Saddar police limits and seized weapons, including two rifles, seven magazines, seven pistols and 1,859 cartridges, from Muhammad Nasim of Shahokhelanwala.

",2019-01-15,"LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly session on Monday saw the treasury and the opposition developing consensus on multiple legislative work.

Both the treasury and the opposition unanimously adopted amendment to the rules of procedure of the Punjab Assembly house empowering the speaker to issue production order of an MPA detained by the law enforcement agencies.

The house also adopted the Punjab Right to Public Services Bill of 2018, while two other bills - the Punjab Domestic Workers Bill of 2018 and the Punjab Prevention of Conflict of Interest Bill of 2018- were postponed by the speaker until January 21 on the request of the opposition.

Opposition Leader Hamza Shahbaz led the opposition, which of late has turned hostile towards the speaker for expelling their six members for hooliganism in the house. On Monday, they praised Speaker Pervaiz Elahi for listening to their concerns on the two deferred bills and for amending the rules to bring PML-N MPA Khawaja Salman Rafique (who is in the National Accountability Bureau’s custody in Paragon City scam) to the house.

Mr Elahi, however, asked Mr Shahbaz to also thank Chief Minister Usman Buzdar for these developments.

Mr Shahbaz said: “We are political workers and always appreciated the good work.” He said the rule of issuing production order for a detained MPA was functional in the other three provincial assemblies and now the Punjab Assembly also joined them. He requested the speaker to issue the production order of Mr Rafique.

Following the opposition’s serious concerns over the Punjab Domestic Workers Bill of 2018, the chair said there were chances of misuse of the bill if adopted without addressing certain matters.

“I suggest the treasury engage the opposition, experts and the general public before finalising the draft to be tabled in the assembly next Monday,” the speaker said.

PML-N’s MPAs Malik Ahmad, Khalil Tahir Sandhu, Azma Bokhari, Waris Kalu, Dr Mazhar Iqbal and Bilal Atta Tarar raised objections to the domestic workers bill, saying that everybody wanted the protection of the rights of the domestic workers but at the same time did not want exploitation of the new law to be used against employers.

Although Law Minister Basharat Raja argued that the bill addressed the objections of the opposition, the speaker insisted that the house should not adopt such law in a haste as it might spoil the reputation of someone if anything went wrong.

“We should welcome opposition’s suggestions as these will be fruitful for the new legislation,” the speaker said.

Former Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana Iqbal took strong exception to the comments of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Mian Aslam Iqbal that he (Rana Iqbal) would run the house on the instruction of his boss Shahbaz Sharif and never accommodated the opposition in the past. Malik Ahmad asked the chair to expunge Aslam Iqbal’s comments. Earlier, the speaker expunged Azma Bokhari’s remarks calling Imran Khan “selected prime minister”.

PPP Parliamentary Leader Hasan Murtaza staged walkout for not taking the opposition on board in the Punjab Right to Public Services Bill of 2018. PTI’s Chaudhry Zaheeruddin persuaded him to end the boycott and return to the House.

Chief Minister Buzdar joined the house only for a few minutes.

",2019-01-15,"THATTA: A two-member reactive mission of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) is to visit the Makli necropolis next week to ascertain whether the 15 recommendations of the UN’s specialised agency for better maintenance of the heritage site were implemented or not.

The reactive mission would specially visit the 15th century shrine of Jam Nizamuddin-II alias Jam Nindo (1443-1509) which had deve­l­o­p­ed wide cracks and is crumbling.

The visiting team of experts comprising Hayashi Nao and Jonathan Stanhope will prepare an exclusive report which is to be presented at Unesco’s next annual meeting, scheduled for June-July 2019 at Baku, Azerbaijan.

At last year’s meeting, held in Poland, followed by a recent meeting in Bahrain, Unesco had war­ned the government of Pakistan that if required steps were not taken towards conservation of the site as per international standards and the 15 recommendations were not followed, the Makli necropolis could be de-listed as an endangered World Heritage Site.

World Heritage Site faces risk of losing ‘endangered’ status

Besides the Jam Nindo tomb, the reactive team would inspect construction of the outer boundary wall of the necropolis and ascertain what measures had been taken to prevent unauthorised burials within the precinct of the heritage site.

A meeting of the archaeology department’s steering committee was held recently under the chairmanship of Manzoor Kanasro, the director general of antiquities and culture. Thatta Deputy Commis­sio­ner Usman Tanveer, consultant (archaeology) Qazi Ayaz, Makli necropolis conservator Sarfaraz Ahmed Jatoi, Nawaz Jatoi and Dr Mohammad Ali Manjhi, a historian and former director general of the culture department, attended the meeting.

It discussed threadbare various issues pertaining to the heritage site with reference to the Unesco reactive mission’s visit, tentatively scheduled for Jan 20-22.

The meeting decided to strictly implement the recommendations including stopping fresh burials in any part of the necropolis.

It noted that an alternative burial site had been earmarked for the local population.

Conservator Jatoi told Dawn that recently, structural engineers, architects and conservationists Mr Matthias from Germ­any and Mr Rand Eppich from Spain had visited the site and conducted geotechnical studies of the monumental shrine on behalf of Unesco with a view to protecting the heritage site. They have alre­ady submitted their reports to Unesco.

It also discussed measures for early completion of the necropolis’s outer boundary and beefed up security at the site.

Former director general of arch­a­e­ology Qasim Ali Qasim has, meanwhile, observed that Unesco was seriously concerned over the state of the Jam Nindo monument, which had been included in the master plan of the archaeology department.

He pointed out that when the position of the tomb’s columns was measured, it emerged that the 33-foot-tall structure with an equal size of plinth had tilted by seven inches which was quite alarming.

Dr Manjhi expressed his concern over Sindh and Balochistan having no representation on Une­sco’s annual convention tho­ugh Punjab and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa did have their representation.

The meeting expressed its satisfaction over the working of digital cracks monitors and weather stations present at the necropolis.

",2019-01-15,"SANGHAR: An alleged raid by Rangers personnel on the house of Sorath Lohar, convener of the Voice for Missing Persons of Sindh (VMPS), triggered a series of protest demonstrations in Karachi, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas and some other parts of the province.

It was alleged that a Rangers’ team raided her house and took away her 17-year-old brother, Singhar, apparently for questioning over some matter relating to the ongoing campaign for what is being called “recovery of enforced disappearance victims”.

There has been no word so far from the Rangers’ personnel about the alleged raid.

Soon after the alleged raid, a number of civil society and nationalist activists held a protest demonstration at Shaheed Chowk in Khipro town of Sanghar district on Sunday.

They said Sorath Lohar had been playing an active role in the campaign as she believed that her father, who had gone missing some two years back, was also a victim of enforced disappearance. Most such victims appeared to be political and nationalist activists, they said.

The protesters described the alleged raid as an attempt to suppress the campaign and gag her voice. They demanded action against the personnel involved in the raid.

Similar demonstrations were held in Karachi and Hyderabad on Sunday and Monday.

MIRPURKHAS: A large number of activists belonging to the Sindh United Party (SUP), Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM) and its Arisar faction, Pakistan Peoples Party-Shaheed Bhutto (PPP-SB) and civil society organisations held a demonstration on Monday outside the local press club to condemn the alleged raid.

They claimed that Ms Lohar, her sister Sassui Lohar and mother were harassed by the raiding team.

Led by SUP activist Manzoor Ahmed Memon, the protesters raised slogans against the raid and demanded appropriate action for the recovery of all victims of enforced disappearance.

They also vowed to foil all attempts to suppress the campaign launched by the VMPS.

They noted with concern that the raiding team picked up Ms Lohar’s teenage brother and appealed to the Sindh Rangers director general to take notice of the action.

HYDERABAD: Civil society activists, including Mushtaq Mirani, Ali Palh advocate, Aslam Baloch, Zulfikar Halepoto, Punhal Sario and Suleman Abro, held a press conference here on Monday to condemn the raid.

They said that Sorath and Sassui were struggling for the recovery of their father. Punhal Sario said that it was their right to seek recovery of their father and other missing persons. He demanded that all such persons be produced before court.

Ali Palh advocate, who is also an activist of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, observed that those at the helm of affairs must know what was happening in the country and that’s why they were raising this issue. “As members of civil society, we cannot remain indifferent if someone goes missing,” he said.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: Local Gove­rn­ment Minister Saeed Ghani has said that the federal government’s “hasty” decision to put 172 persons named in the report of a joint investigation team (JIT) formed by the Supreme Court on the Exit Control List (ECL) suggested that it was actually a conspiracy to topple the Sindh government.

The minister said this while talking to the media after the session of the Sindh Assembly on Monday.

To a question, he said that the JIT had overstepped its authority by recommending in its report the names for their inclusion on the ECL. He said it was not his viewpoint, but it was the observation of the chief justice of Pakistan since the JIT was tasked to investigate the allegations and submit its report.

He asked whether the government had constituted any committee for including the names on the ECL or whether the Supreme Court had given orders to the federal government to do so.

In reply to another question, the LG minister said that objections were being raised on the capabilities and performance of the National Accountability Bureau ever since it was constituted.

He said during all previous governments, including the then Pakistan Peoples Party-led government, NAB had been politically victimising the PPP and even today it was being used by the government against his party.

Regarding Prime Minister Imran Khan and Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry’s upcoming visit to Sindh, Mr Ghani said that unfortunately Mr Khan was a “selected prime minister” who could visit Sindh by all means but Mr Chaudhry was not even recognised by his own party members so what could he say about him.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was informed during Question Hour on Monday that ostrich was not defined as a protected bird under the provincial wildlife laws and its farming was allowed under relevant laws.

Furnishing a statement on the floor, Forest and Wildlife Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said that a special permission for ostrich farming was required to be obtained from the provincial authorities as for poultry farming.

He said that a private farm had been established in Thatta for ostrich farming.

In reply to a question, he said that the Rs150.97 million project of rehabilitation and improvement of wildlife sanctuaries at the Haleji Lake, Langh Lake, Thatta and Qambar could not be completed owing to paucity of funds, and added that it would be completed in June.

He said that different jobs at the Haleji Lake, including liner plantation along the inspection path, development of floating mounts, development of a pelican island, restoration of historical information centres, development of the fun area for children, restoration and repair of lavatories, restoration of the crocodile enclosure, installation of a wireless system, and construction of floating rooms, had been carried out.

In reply to another question asked by opposition member Nusrat Sehar Abbasi, the minister said that a Rs50m project for habitat restoration and development of water harvesting facilities at the KNP, Karachi, and Jamshoro was expected to be completed by June 2019.

However, he added, the project’s date of completion had been extended by two years because of paucity of funds.

Answering a question by opposition member Arif Mustafa Jatoi, the minister said the Pai Forest in Shaheed Benazirabad had been declared a game reserve.

He said that hunting was not allowed in the Pai Forest, but the government was empowered to relax the rules and issue permits for hunting in special cases.

In reply to another question, Mr Shah furnished details of the year-wise allocation and utilisation of the budget for plantation and rehabilitation of forests during the past five years.

The minister said Rs612m was allocated in 2017-18.

Giving answer to a question, he said that the local fishermen were catching Indus blind dolphin as previously the Sindh fisheries department was issuing fishing permits for the catch.

He said that the population of the endangered species had remarkably increased since 2014 when the issuance of fishing licences by the SFD was finally stopped with efforts of the Sindh wildlife department.

The minister also told the house on a question by opposition member Arsalan Taj Hussain that 12 different species were declared endangered in the province. They were: Sindh ibex, Afghan urial, Indian wolf, honey badger, mugger, or marsh crocodile, gharial, or gavial, smooth-coated Indian otter, Indus blind dolphin, greater flamingo, freshwater turtles, hog deer (axis porcinus) and chinkara deer.

He said that several steps had been taken to conserve the endangered species. The steps, he said, included the establishment of a series of protected areas such as National Park, 34 wildlife sanctuaries and 13 game reserves for protection, conservation and management of endangered wildlife species.

Besides, the minister said, the Sindh Turtles and Tortoise Protection, Conservation and Compensation Rules 2014 had been enacted to ensure the conservation and protection of turtles in the province.

93,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457589/air-pollution-termed-greatest-environmental-threat-to-health,"Air pollution termed greatest environmental threat to health
",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: Describing air pollution as the world’s single biggest environmental health risk, experts at a three-day international conference, which concluded at Karachi University (KU) on Sunday, called for collaborative research efforts to determine the impact of specific sources of air pollution on human health.

They were speaking at the fifth international conference on ‘Environmental horizon, sounding the alarm! Environment, climate change and health’ organised by KU’s department of chemistry and Office of Research Innovation and Commercialisation (ORIC), and International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS).

Sharing global concerns on air pollution, Dr Haider A. Khwaja from Wadsworth Centre at the School of Public Health of University at Albany in New York, said that air pollution was a serious public health issue the world over as population-based studies had documented health risks resulting from short-term exposure to air pollutants.

“The World Health Organisation reports that in 2012 around seven million people died — one in eight of total global deaths — due to exposure to air pollution. This data confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk,” he noted.

He said that the South Asian and Western Pacific regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012 with 2.6m deaths linked to outdoor air pollution and 3.3m deaths related to indoor pollution, according to WHO.

A significant number of these deaths, he said, occurred due to stroke and cardiopulmonary diseases. These findings were not based on a significant increase in pollution but rather on improved knowledge of the links between air pollutants and cardiopulmonary diseases.

Dr James J. Schauer, a senior civil and environmental engineer heading the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the association of atmospheric particulate matter particles with adverse health effects had been well established and led experts to develop standards on these pollutants and implement control measures.

According to him, different strategies can be used in air pollution control programmes to reduce the impact of particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, given the complex nature of the sources of these pollutants.

He emphasised the need for collaborative efforts between atmospheric science studies and epidemiological and toxicological studies to establish how specific sources of air pollution were affecting human health.

Sheryl H. Ehrman from Davidson College of Engineering, San Jose State University, USA, informed the audience that anthropogenic pollutants had been successfully reduced in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, resulting in improved air quality.

However, she said that parts of the mid-Atlantic were still non-attainment regions (areas which are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards as defined in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 of the United States).

The ozone, she pointed out, was a secondary air pollutant, formed by reactions between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. Ozone precursors were mainly emitted by power plants, motor vehicles, industrial operations and biogenic sources.

“In the past several years, a new influx of emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing-based production of natural gas in the Marcellus Shale (the largest gas field in the US) may be counteracting the benefits that have been gained. On the flip side, low-cost natural gas could replace coal as fuel for power plants, potentially reducing emissions,” she observed.

Another speaker, Parisa A. Ariya of the department of chemistry and department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, shared that the International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and WHO had identified airborne particles as a research priority of the utmost importance.

She said the IPCC pointed to the importance of aerosol-cloud processes due to their impacts on the absorption and scattering of irradiation, altering the earth’s climate whereas WHO predominantly considered aerosols to be health hazards.

Former federal minister for science and technology Atta-ur-Rahman spoke about how progress in science and technology had dramatically changed socio-economic conditions in different countries.

Director ICCBS Prof M. Iqbal Choudhary said biodiversity was a manifestation of chemical diversity and plants contained a fascinating array of highly evolved, specific and effective gene products.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court-mandated commission on water and sanitation in Sindh on Monday directed the local government secretary to hold a meeting with authorities concerned regarding public parks and submit a report about the feasibility of a scheme to convert sewage into grey water for gardening.

The commission, headed by retired Justice Amir Hani Muslim, gave one month to the LG secretary to file his report.

Justice Muslim visited the Fateh Park in North Nazimabad on Jan 12 on the request of the chairman of the district municipal corporation Central, where a registered society had introduced a scheme, Green Initiative, for converting sewage into grey water, which could be utilised for any purposes other than human consumption.

The commission said that not only the park in question, but other areas could also benefit through treated water.

DMC Central chairman Rehan Hashmi informed the commission that he introduced this scheme and was also planning to initiate it in different parks within the district.

The commission said that such schemes could make a huge difference if introduced in big parks and would also ease pressure on potable water as grey water can be utilised for gardening and maintenance of green patches.

It observed that the provincial government was required to examine the feasibility of converting sewage into grey water.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: Following a debate on extreme delays in awarding funds through a new National Finance Commission (NFC), the Sindh Assembly on Monday unanimously demanded that the federal government announce the NFC shares to the provinces in the next award.

Members of the Sindh Assembly, which met here with Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani in the chair, spoke for more than two hours in the debate allowed after the house admitted an adjournment motion moved by Pakistan Peoples Party’s Nida Khuhro last week.

As the debate ended, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Chawla tabled a motion calling the Sindh government to approach the federal government asking it to announce the NFC shares to the provinces.

The motion was unanimously passed. Members of opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan were present in the house but no lawmaker belonging to the Grand Democratic Alliance was present.

The members referred to Article 160 of the Constitution, according to which the president would notify the NFC award after every five years.

Lawmakers question Punjab’s biggest share

The current seventh NFC award gave 42.5 per cent of the divisible pool of taxes to the federal government. The remaining 57.5pc was distributed among the provinces — Punjab got 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc and Balochistan 9.09pc.

The members questioned the current multiple criteria under which Punjab took the largest share although it was Sindh that contributed up to 70pc to the total kitty.

A minister wants funds’ distribution on the basis of population factor decreased

They said population was still the dominant factor in awarding the NFC, which stood at 82pc. The share for backwardness, poverty and revenue collection was 5pc, 10.3pc and 2.7pc.

Education and Culture Minister Sardar Shah said it was time to reduce the share based on population to a significant level and other criteria should be given more share.

He said the NFC award was not just an issue for the Sindh government or the ruling PPP, but it involved the whole province for which all political parties in Sindh should get united and launch a struggle for the benefit of the people.

“No matter you belong to the PTI, MQM or any other party, we all belong to Sindh and we have to speak for the rights of Sindh,” he said.

He said out of a total area of 140,000 square kilometres of Sindh, just 34pc of it was irrigated by barrages and linked to canal systems; and two-thirds of Sindh equally deserved to be developed at par with the rest.

“To develop such remote vast swathes we need money, we need funds,” he said, adding that the reduction in the population criterion and increase in other factors would benefit Sindh and Balochistan.

He referred to the PTI leadership’s mantra of ‘Naya Pakistan’, saying a new Pakistan could only be possible by abiding by the Constitution.

Mover Nida Khuhro said the way the Centre was “victimising” Sindh for electing the PPP again, the NFC should now be called “No Funds Coming Award”.

She said like the previous government of Nawaz Sharif, the PTI government was not sincere in giving NFC award on time.

She said the federal government had not paid Rs90 billion to Sindh, which forced the provincial government to cut its development budget.

Ms Khuhro said instead of provinces, the federal government should award 3pc from its share to erstwhile Fata. “Such decisions are blatant violations of the Constitution. Neither the prime minister nor the cabinet can take such decisions without amending the Constitution.”

Opposition asks PPP to give a ‘just’ PFC award

All the opposition members supported the treasury member’s adjournment motion, yet they pressed on their demand that the funds coming to provinces should further be channelled to the third tier of government as well.

MQM-P’s Khwaja Izharul Hasan appreciated the fiscal policy teams of the PPP and the MQM, which succeeded in changing the NFC formula in recent years, which was earlier singularly based on the population criterion.

He, however, said Karachi was Sindh’s capital and its greatest revenue producer, yet the megacity was not receiving its due share from the provincial exchequer.

Khwaja Izhar said the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) in Sindh constituted by the government was not formed justly.

PTI’s parliamentary party leader Haleem Adil Shaikh blamed the provincial government for sending nomination for its member in the NFC after three months despite several reminders sent by Islamabad.

He said it was the Sindh government which should be blamed for a delayed constitution of the NFC.

He also demanded the PFC award claiming that the Sindh government had spent just 15pc of the development budget in the past six months while it allowed Rs391bn meant for development to lapse in the past nine years.

GDA’s Nusrat Abbasi also demanded the formation of the PFC award.

PPP’s Taimur Talpur said it was then president Asif Zardari who gave greater share to the provinces through a progressive NFC award.

GDA’s Arif Jatoi said former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had set up the NFC award based only on the population basis.

MQM-P’s Mohammad Hussain said Sindh had been a victim of the Centre’s “biased” attitude both in the NFC share and the PSDP.

He said all the lawmakers belonging to Sindh from parliament and the provincial assembly should register their protest in Islamabad jointly.

He added that the provincial government should ensure a just PFC award for every district of Sindh.

Jawaid Hanif, Ghanwar Isran, Omar Umari, Abdul Rasheed and Qasim Siraj also spoke.

The house passed The Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma Karachi Bill, 2018 unanimously. The bill was duly amended and recommended by the select committee.

An adjournment motion moved by PPP’s Sadia Jawed was admitted about the Karachi Circular Railway and a debate regarding the federal government’s promise was fixed for Thursday.

Five calling-attention notices by Haleem Shaikh, Riaz Haider, Marui Rashdi, Nusrat Abbasi and Mangla Sharma were responded to by the ministers concerned.

",2019-01-15,"ISLAMABAD: Leaders of some Balochistan-based political parties on Monday threatened to hold a protest during the expected visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Gwadar next month.

Independent MNA Moha­m­mad Aslam Bhootani from Gwadar and leader of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) Agha Hassan Baloch from Quetta criticised the federal government for “not taking elected representatives into confidence” regarding deve­l­opment activities being carried out in Balochistan, particularly in Gwadar.

Take a look: Balochistan cabinet shocked by CPEC presentation

“We will tell the Saudi prince that Balochistan is not for sale and that elected representatives of the port city have not been taken on board regarding the development activities,” Mr Bhootani, who sits on the treasury bench, said while speaking in the National Assembly.

“We will not allow any investment in Gwadar if we are bypassed,” he added.

According to media reports, the Saudi prince is expected to visit next month and would lay the foundation stone of a Saudi oil refinery in Gwadar.

Mr Bhootani said that elected MNAs and MPAs would also meet the Saudi ambassador in Pakistan and apprise him about their concerns.

He said earlier projects worth $62 billion were announced for Gwadar but the local representatives did not know where that money had been spent.

“Now we hear that Saudi Arabia is setting up an oil refinery in Gwadar but again the people of the port city have not been taken into confidence,” he regretted.

Mr Bhootani said not only him but elected representatives of the BNP-M were also not consulted regarding development projects in Balochistan.

National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser urged the MNA not to make a hue and cry as investment in Gwadar was a “sensitive” matter.

Agha Hassan Baloch of the BNP-M said that although his party was an ally of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in the centre, it was also kept in the dark regarding development activities in Baloch­istan and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.

“We are not against development activities in Balochistan, but the people of the province are disapp­ointed over being ignored,” he said.

“We did not get anything from the CPEC and now we are being bypassed again,” the BNP-M leader added.

98,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457630/pti-leader-terms-sustainable-development-goal-targets-unrealistic,"PTI leader terms Sustainable Development Goal targets unrealistic
",2019-01-15,"Kanwal Shauzab

ISLAMABAD: Terming the existing SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) targets unrealistic, a ruling party’s parliamentary secretary advocated binding all provinces to agree and deliver on improving basic health and human conditions in the light of local conditions.

Speaking to a group of journalists on Monday, Kanwal Shauzab, the parliamentary secretary of planning and development, said the 18th Constitution Amendment did not mean allowing the provinces to become ‘states within the state’ and they should be bound under Article 25 of the Constitution as to what they ought to do under the development agenda.

“Instead of being unanswerable to international agencies, the ADPs (annual development plans of the provinces) and PSDPs (public sector development programmes of the Centre) should be based on needs of the local people” to be responsive to basic human requirements, she said, adding that the funds should not be given to MNAs and MPAs to spend here and there on untargeted programmes without measuring outcomes.

She said the PTI government would have to change the definition of development budget from mega infrastructure like roads and building projects and shift the focus of spending directly on the people by addressing root causes of poverty and hunger.

Kanwal says 18th Amendment does not mean allowing provinces to become ‘states within the state’

Giving an example of just one hospital of Bahawalpur in south Punjab, Ms Shauzab said a total of 1,380,000 patients visited the outpatient department (OPD) and 85pc of them were referred to dialysis centre, which meant the quality of water and nutrition conditions of the country were to blame.

She said motorways passed through the area, but the people on both sides did not have the access road to reach the hospital or take their produce to the market.

In such conditions, she said, the people of the area were demanding hospitals and more dialysis machines. The need under the SDGs should be to address the water quality and ensure its supply to all to eradicate water-borne diseases rather than only building hospitals because by the time a hospital became operational the need for 10 more hospitals would arise.

She said the objective of the SDGs should not be to leave anybody behind and problems of poverty, hunger and nutrition should be addressed on a top priority basis. The imported agenda of SDGs would not resolve the issue of poverty and hence the SDG targets should be reframed in the light of local conditions.

Ms Shauzab said reprioritisation of development programmes should be done to achieve social sector goals, but there were interest groups everywhere that promoted foreign-sponsored agendas and projects.

She said the Voluntary National Review (VNR) for SDGs would be ready by June this year as work was under way in consultation with all stakeholders for achieving desired goals under the SDGs. But, she added, Pakistan had not yet worked out the exact financing requirement attached to achieve the SDGs and to achieve these goals without the commitment from the international community for financing seemed really too much ambitious.

She said the people of the country were missing from development priorities as infrastructure development was the top priority at a time when human development conditions were showing prevalence of an alarming situation.

Ms Shauzab said the Planning Commission was working on developing civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) for identification of 30 per cent gap in “our data to help achieve the SDGs by 2030”.

She said that CRVS was the compulsory, continuous, universal and permanent recording of all vital events such as birth and death. From these records, vital statistics on birth, death, cause of death, fertility and mortality (where migration data is also available) could be produced for policy and planning.

It could help in connecting data from birth registration to all important events of all individuals’ life for achieving the SDG targets and tracking all other requirements and obligations.

Ms Shauzab said that it was impossible to achieve the SDGs when acute poverty prevailed in several parts of the country, especially in south Punjab and interior of Sindh.

In reply to a question about the cost for achieving the SDGs, the parliamentary secretary said that work was under way along with stakeholders, but being a signatory to all goals on behalf of Pakistan, the federal government would have to re-prioritise the development requirements even after the enactment of the 18th Amendment.

",2019-01-15,"KARACHI: The world’s youngest Nobel Prize laureate and education activist Malala Yousafzai on Monday revealed that she had a photo of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in her room at Oxford University.

In a brief interview with the BBC, the 21-year-old activist spoke about what she does in between writing and university life.

“I think for relaxing it's just spending time with friends, playing cricket or just having a bit of gossip or just going for lunch,” she said. Malala, who is starting her second year at Oxford University studying philosophy, politics and economics, has often talked about her love for cricket. “When I say I love cricket, I’m not that good,” she quickly added.

Asked what the Nobel Prize winner did for fun, Ms Yousafzai expressed her liking for British comedy and sitcoms. “I recently watched the Blackadder. Sometimes I watch Yes, Minister and I also like the show Mind Your Language which I know wouldn’t be welcome the same way it was but I find it funny,” she said.

In terms of her university room and how she fares on keeping it clean, the global icon said her mother tells her off for being untidy. “I am not a big fan of posters, but I have a photo of Benazir Bhutto in my room,” she added.

Benazir Bhutto, who became Pakistan’s first female prime minister in 1988, had also attained an undergraduate degree from Oxford’s Lady Margaret Hall in the subjects of philosophy, economics and politics.

On Jan 8, Malala’s latest book We are Displaced: My Journey and Stories from Refugee Girls Around the World was released worldwide. In the latest title, Ms Yousafzai tells her own story and shares the journeys of other young female refugees who’ve been forced from their homes.

“We hear about refugees and immigrants but we never hear from them, especially from young women and girls,” she told the BBC explaining why she wrote the book.

Ms Yousafzai, who belongs to Swat, has been living in Birmingham, UK, since October 2012. Speaking about her own experience of settling in the country as an immigrant, she said: “In the beginning, it was very difficult. But, then I realised when you take a step forward and try to talk to people, it helps.”

“Now I’m proudly Brummie as well,” she quipped.

",2019-01-15,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar said on Monday that the Supreme Court had never exceeded its limits and that the people of the country had confidence in the apex court.

Addressing the launching ceremony of the Police Reforms Committee’s report — “Police Reforms: Way Forward” — organised by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP), he said the Supreme Court had disposed of 85 per cent cases and provided relief to people.

Explore: Judicial overreach?

He said people wanted positive change and the rule of law in the country. He said that every action he had taken as CJP was within the parameter of the law, adding that he had never exceeded his constitutional mandate.

The CJP said the police reforms constituted an integral part of the criminal justice system reforms. Since the independence of the country about two dozen reform initiatives had been undertaken, however, desired results could not be achieved, he added.

Justice Nisar says relief has been provided to people by apex court

He emphasised the importance of the rule of law and an efficient criminal justice system in society. He stated that the police had a crucial role in protecting the right to a fair trial and in the prevention and investigation of crimes.

Also read: Why 2018 was CJP Nisar's year

According to the CJP, an effective police force is one that is assisted by the community they serve as people are confident that justice will be done.

He stressed that the existing criminal justice system urgently required reforms as a whole. Especially upgrade of the law for governance and management is required to ensure a neutral, responsive, accountable and transparent police force. The police force could only function efficiently when they were given administrative, operational and financial autonomy, he added.

CJP Nisar said that the Police Reforms Committee was established with the objective of an independent and impartial police force and its recommendations were very useful because they outline the duties of police officers, the separation of investigation procedures and composition of the Commission to promote transparency.

He stated that by implementing these recommendations, trust deficit between police and public would decrease and it would create a competent, efficient and responsive police force.

The CJP applauded efforts and contribution of members of the Police Reforms Committee, saying that they worked day and night to complete the report.

In his concluding remarks, CJP Nisar stressed the need for de-politicising the police to develop public confidence in the system. He stressed that there was a need to pinpoint lacunae in investigation resulting in the acquittal of criminals.

Report on police reforms

A steering committee headed by Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court and the designated chief justice of Pakistan, worked on the implementation of recommendations.

The convener of the Police Reforms Committee and former inspector general of Sindh Police, Afzal Ali Shigri, stated that performance of police was directly linked to the delivery of justice and performance of judiciary and criminal justice system.

He said in the past several efforts had been made to improve the performance of the criminal justice system. But, he added, the current initiative had the distinction that it was taken by the Supreme Court.

Mr Shigri said after formation of the Police Reforms Committee intensive deliberations and discussion were held within the committee. He said the report contained feasible and practical proposals on matters, like the redressal of grievances and improvement in the quality of investigation.

Mr Shigri also presented the report on police reforms to CJP Nisar.

The report recommends certain measures, such as establishment of “complaint redressal mechanism” at the office of the city police officer headed by an officer of additional inspector general rank in provinces and deputy inspector general in Islamabad.

It stresses the need of imparting best training to police officers, revamping urban policing and introducing forum for alternative dispute resolution (ADR).

",2019-01-14,"The police on Monday set free their four colleagues who were found to be “negligent” a day earlier when a man shot another man dead in their presence in Karachi's New Town locality.

Sohail Mughal, who had filed a petition in court for the recovery of his estranged wife and three daughters, had on Sunday allegedly gunned down 37-year-old Munawar Ali, with whom his wife and the children were living in flat in New Town. He had opened the fire in the presence of police personnel, who had escorted him to the victim's residence.

But police authorities said there was no legal cover to book the law enforcement personnel under criminal negligence charges as the new police act put in place a few years ago did not carry any such provision.

“We don’t have any penal section in PPC (Pakistan Penal Code) or Sindh Police Act wherein we could charge police officers for acts of criminal negligence,” revealed DIG East Amir Farooqi.

The senior officer pointed out that previously “we had section 155 in Police Order 2002 to place criminal liability in instances of criminal negligence by police officers”, but it was no longer applicable.

All detained police officers of Darakshan police who escorted the suspect on Sunday were thus released.

However, the DIG Farooqi said they have written to the DIG South to ""initiate departmental action against the delinquent police officers who brought accused Sohail Mughal in a police mobile bearing a gun"".

On Sunday, a police party had gone to the residence of Munawar Ali along with petitioner Sohail Mughal to arrest Ali on a court order to present Mughal's wife and his three daughters in court on the next hearing of the case.

However, before the police could arrest him, Mughal, who had hidden a 9mm pistol concealed in his shalwar, took out the gun and opened fire on Ali.

He fired four shots as a result of which Ali sustained two bullet wounds and was taken by the additional SHO Darakhshan to the Liaquat National Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Police arrested Mughal with the pistol and collected spent bullet casings from the crime scene.

On Monday, a case was registered against the suspect under Section 302 (murder) of the PPC on behalf of SHO New Town Mohammed Zubair.

The DIG East explained that the case was registered on behalf of the state as the victim’s family was insisting to nominate the police party which brought Mughal to the victim's residence.

An initial inquiry revealed that the officers could be guilty of ‘negligence’ but they had no involvement in Ali's murder.

The suspect in his initial statement before the police stated that he killed Ali as the deceased had allegedly ""misguided"" his family against him and also ""occupied"" his property.

According to DIG Farooqi, a daughter of the suspect is a doctor and the family had been separated ""legally"" from the father three years ago.

Police said it was still being probed as to what relation the deceased had with the family. The victim was involved in the construction business and also owned a car showroom.

Police sources said the deceased was being ""supported"" by an official of a civilian federal agency.

",2019-01-14,"The Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination on Monday announced that Poliovirus was detected from the sewage of eight cities across the country during the environmental surveillance carried out by the polio eradication programme during last month.

According to the results shared by National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), the presence of poliovirus was confirmed in sewage samples collected from Karachi, Peshawar, Bannu, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Killa Abdullah, Pishin and Quetta during December 2018.

Under the supervision of the relevant provincial health departments, samples of sewage water are collected on a monthly basis from 58 sampling sites across Pakistan. They are tested by the regional reference laboratory for polio housed at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad.

As per the statement issued by the health ministry, in consideration of the associated risks, the country's polio programme has urged parents to ensure the immunisation of all children under the age of five in the upcoming polio campaign, which is scheduled to start from January 21.

National Coordinator Emergency Operation Centre for Polio Dr Rana Safdar said that while case counts were declining, as long as the virus was present anywhere in the country, the threat of the virus for vulnerable children remained.

""To finally eradicate the virus, vaccinating all children against all preventable diseases including polio is imperative both in routine as well as in special door to door campaigns,"" Dr Safdar added.

While acknowledging the progress that had already been made, the recently concluded Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio urged the programme to focus on children who missed the vaccination, for any reason and to ensure that the virus didn't survive any longer.

The group met on January 11-12 in Islamabad to assess the programme progress, opportunities and the remaining challenges towards achieving the goal of stopping transmission of the poliovirus.

Prime Minister's Focal Person for Polio Eradication Babar bin Atta said the ""misconception of a caregiver led to paralysis of another child in Bajaur agency, who had every right to live healthy and productive life. It is a reminder to everyone that no excuse can save your child from paralysis, especially if the child is not repeatedly vaccinated.""

He added that it was more cumbersome when paralysis is life long and irreversible.",APP,"['ministry', 'national', 'health', 'services', 'regulations', 'coordination', 'monday', 'announced', 'poliovirus', 'detected', 'sewage', 'eight', 'cities', 'across', 'country', 'environmental', 'surveillance', 'carried', 'polio', 'eradication', 'programme', 'last', 'month', 'according', 'results', 'shared', 'national', 'emergency', 'operations', 'centre', 'neoc', 'presence', 'poliovirus', 'confirmed', 'sewage', 'samples', 'collected', 'karachi', 'peshawar', 'bannu', 'lahore', 'rawalpindi', 'killa', 'abdullah', 'pishin', 'quetta', 'december', '2018', 'supervision', 'relevant', 'provincial', 'health', 'departments', 'samples', 'sewage', 'water', 'collected', 'monthly', 'basis', '58', 'sampling', 'sites', 'across', 'pakistan', 'tested', 'regional', 'reference', 'laboratory', 'polio', 'housed', 'national', 'institute', 'health', 'nih', 'islamabad', 'per', 'statement', 'issued', 'health', 'ministry', 'consideration', 'associated', 'risks', 'country', 'polio', 'programme', 'urged', 'parents', 'ensure', 'immunisation', 'children', 'age', 'five', 'upcoming', 'polio', 'campaign', 'scheduled', 'start', 'january', '21', 'national', 'coordinator', 'emergency', 'operation', 'centre', 'polio', 'dr', 'rana', 'safdar', 'said', 'case', 'counts', 'declining', 'long', 'virus', 'present', 'anywhere', 'country', 'threat', 'virus', 'vulnerable', 'children', 'remained', 'finally', 'eradicate', 'virus', 'vaccinating', 'children', 'preventable', 'diseases', 'including', 'polio', 'imperative', 'routine', 'well', 'special', 'door', 'door', 'campaigns', 'dr', 'safdar', 'added', 'acknowledging', 'progress', 'already', 'made', 'recently', 'concluded', 'technical', 'advisory', 'group', 'tag', 'polio', 'urged', 'programme', 'focus', 'children', 'missed', 'vaccination', 'reason', 'ensure', 'virus', 'nt', 'survive', 'longer', 'group', 'met', 'january', '1112', 'islamabad', 'assess', 'programme', 'progress', 'opportunities', 'remaining', 'challenges', 'towards', 'achieving', 'goal', 'stopping', 'transmission', 'poliovirus', 'prime', 'minister', 'focal', 'person', 'polio', 'eradication', 'babar', 'bin', 'atta', 'said', 'misconception', 'caregiver', 'led', 'paralysis', 'another', 'child', 'bajaur', 'agency', 'every', 'right', 'live', 'healthy', 'productive', 'life', 'reminder', 'everyone', 'excuse', 'save', 'child', 'paralysis', 'especially', 'child', 'repeatedly', 'vaccinated', 'added', 'cumbersome', 'paralysis', 'life', 'long', 'irreversible']","['poliovirus', 'detected', 'sewage', 'eight', 'cities']"
105,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457510/nab-chairman-should-appear-before-parliament-demands-zardari,"NAB chairman should appear before parliament, demands Zardari
",2019-01-14,"PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari on Monday said that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman should appear before the parliament in person, instead of lawmakers going to him to discuss the bureau's procedure for moving against opposition members accused of corruption.

Speaking during a National Assembly session, the former president said the time has come for the parliament to call the NAB chairman and ""proclaim a law"" that before any parliamentarian is summoned by NAB, their case should come to the house committee on law so it can decide whether there is actually a case against the said lawmaker or their family.

Editorial: Meaningful accountability

Zardari said he was hearing of plans among various parties to call on the NAB chairman, purportedly to discuss the bureau's anti-corruption drive that has ensnared several opposition members.

""Why will you go to the NAB chairman?"" he asked the MNAs present, before declaring: ""The NAB chairman should appear in person before the parliament.""

Zardari said the matter was not personal to him because he had encountered ""many NABs"" during his career and ""will continue to face them"".

""The real issue is, what will happen when you are summoned [by the accountability watchdog]?"" he said with a meaningful smile, addressing the treasury benches.

Zardari said his party was ""totally happy"" that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had today been given relief by the Supreme Court in the Avenfield corruption reference. He added that the PPP also ""does not want to see"" Nawaz's daughter, Maryam Nawaz, in the jail.

Speaking about his own troubles, he said it would be ""uncalled for"" and ""above the law"" if a new joint investigation team is formed comprising representatives of the ISI and other institutions, in the fake accounts case.

The PPP co-chairman said it was in the government's interest to ""tighten"" the NAB as doing so will reduce the prevailing ""insecurity"" among the bureaucracy and the country will start functioning to some extent.

Criticising the PTI government's performance of the first few months, he told the treasury members: ""We will not bring down your [government], you will fall yourselves.""

He said he wants to work to strengthen the parliament and democracy, and pointing towards government benches said, ""I also want to train these news friends that have come to the parliament.""

'No foreign force can prevent economic slide'

Zardari said the international financial support being given to Pakistan by friendly countries is welcome, but no ""foreign force"" can prevent the economic slide the country appeared to be heading towards because of PTI government's policies.

""Considering the financial situation at present [and] the way decisions are being taken arbitrarily... the country cannot be managed in this manner,"" the former president said.

He said no foreign power, be it China or any other country, could save Pakistan once it starts its journey towards becoming a ""failed state"" on the sliding scale ""because everyone will think of their own country"".

Zardari said during the PPP government's tenure, he had generated interest for investment in Pakistan through his 15 visits to China. It later materalised in the form of the agreement leading to the handover of the Gwadar port to China, he added.

Shahbaz questions Mohmand dam contract award

Earlier, Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif expressed concern over the government's move to award the contract for the Rs309 billion Mohmand dam to a Descon-led consortium on a single bid basis.

He said the manner in which the contract had been awarded had ""put question marks"" on the entire procedure. The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (Pepra) rules allow the award of contracts on a single-bid basis, but with certain conditionalities, he added.

""What was the urgency in awarding the contract?"" the PML-N president questioned. ""Why was rebidding not done?""

He said the bidding process for the project was initiated during the PML-N government, but it was the incumbent government that had awarded the contract. ""The responsibility of awarding the contract for the project lies with the PTI government,"" he added.

He said there was a ""direct conflict of interest"" in awarding the dam contract to the company allegedly owned by Abdul Razak Dawood, who is an adviser to the prime minister.

Shahbaz claimed that the PML-N government had eliminated loadshedding from the country by launching a number of projects on a war-footing basis

""If the country is facing loadshedding again then it is due to the negligence and incapability of the present PTI government.""

He said the current government was generating electricity through furnace oil which is the most expensive fuel and LNG-based power plants were presently not functioning to full capacity.

Opposition hatching conspiracy against dams: Vawda

As Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda stood up to respond to Shahbaz's criticism, the opposition refused to listen to him and staged a walkout.

Meanwhile, Speaker Asad Qaiser ordered a headcount after PPP lawmaker Shagufta Jumani pointed out the quorum. The opposition bid to disrupt proceedings by pointing out the quorum failed, however, with the speaker declaring the house in order after the headcount.

Vawda in his remarks criticised the opposition for staging a walkout after delivering speeches and presenting ""wrong facts before the house"".

Defending the government's award of the Mohmand dam contract to the Descon-led consortium, he said the project had been in files for 54 years and the PTI government had pulled it from there.

""The opposition is hatching a conspiracy against dams as they want to do politics on this issue,"" he alleged.

Vawda said the Mohmand dam will be completed under Imran Khan's government.

He said it was wrong to say that the contract had been awarded on a single-bid basis as five companies had submitted bids for the project after issuance of advertisements.

""The opposition leader has wrongly interpreted the Pepra rules,"" he claimed.

The minister said the government will not offer any NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance-like deal) to the opposition leaders.

""Their politics have been buried [...] they will either go to jail or in exile.""

",2019-01-14,"PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif on Monday spoke in military courts' favour and hinted that his party could consider supporting an extension, if approached by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led government.

Earlier this month, the law ministry informed a National Assembly standing committee that the summary for a second extension in military courts has been forwarded to the federal cabinet for approval.

In December, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had unequivocally said that his party would not support another extension to the military courts, whose current two-year term is set to expire in March.

While the PPP chairman, who had his reservations the last time as well, is unlikely to support the extension, his PML-N counterpart does not appear to oppose the idea.

""If the current government contacts us over the extension of military courts, we will think about it,"" Sharif told media representatives at Parliament House today.

The PML-N leader recalled that the military courts were formed during his sibling Nawaz Sharif's premiership, adding that ""terrorism was eradicated due to the establishment of the military courts, Zarb-i-Azb and Radd-ul-Fasaad"".

The leader of the opposition in the National Assembly credited the fear created from the military courts as a major factor in the war against terrorism.

Sharif's remarks are in line with those of his fellow PML-N leader Miftah Ismael, who recently said that his party will support the government in extension of tenure of military courts only if the PTI satisfies them in parliament on the issue.

“The military courts issue will be discussed in parliament. And if the government satisfied the PML-N lawmakers on the reasons behind extending term of the special courts, they will support the cause,” the former adviser on finance told the media on Sunday.

In March 2017, military courts were revived for the next two years after then president Mamnoon Hussain had ratified a NA bill on the matter.

The extension, however, had come after more than two months of deliberations and a tug of war between government and opposition parties over the technicalities of military courts' functioning.

",2019-01-14,"The Supreme Court on Monday expressed disappointment with the central and provincial governments over their failure to devise a mechanism for the conservation and purification of underground water and impose tax on its extraction, in line with a previous decision of the apex court.

A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nasir, was hearing a case pertaining to conservation, purification and taxation on extraction of underground water by bottled water companies.

Last week, the apex court had imposed a levy on companies selling mineral water and beverages at a rate of Re1 for every litre of surface water extracted by them. The revenue so collected will go to the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams fund. Authored by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, the judgement also required the provincial governments as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory administration to set up separate and distinct accounts to receive the amounts collected under the water charges. The amounts will then be deposited in the SC-created dams fund.

The judgement was issued on a suo motu case pertaining to selling by the companies of water extracted from underground sources without any charge as well as the quality and fitness of the same for human consumption.

The apex court had also constituted a special committee to devise a mechanism for calculation, collection and monitoring of the recovery of water charges from all major industries consuming surface or groundwater. The court had directed the federal and provincial governments to ensure installation of a foolproof and state-of-the-art metering mechanism at every extraction unit. The extraction will be monitored closely by the respective EPA on a daily basis, the verdict said.

On Monday, the chief justice remarked that water has become more ""precious than gold [but] if we passed remarks [over the situation] then headlines would state that [the judiciary] has raised questions on the credibility of the government"".

Dr Abdul Rahim, the secretary of the Law and Justice Commission — established for the systematic development and reform of laws — informed the top judge that neither its recommendations on the issue were heeded upon, nor an awareness campaign was launched.

The representative of the Punjab government, Owais Ahmed, informed the bench that the provincial government had approved 31 recommendations out of 38. He said that the government has formed a task force on water reservoirs, purification and taxation to deal with the issue.

Chief Justice Nisar reprimanded the representative, saying that the Supreme Court-mandated Water Commission did a lot of work, ""the government[s] are provided with everything but they don't want to do anything.""

""The Punjab government lacks both the will and the capability,"" the chief justice remarked.

""It seems that you people have decided to kill people of thirst [while] bureaucratic tapes appear in each and every matter. It seems that all the papers will be left in the record room of the court.""

""[We have] said time and again to take measures on a war-footing basis [to resolve the issue],"" he added.

The law and justice commission secretary pleaded the court to issue an order in this regard, to which Justice Nisar replied: ""The court will continue to issue orders but the government has become insensitive. People's lives are associated with water. If the government does nothing, it will be criminal negligence.""

Justice Ijazul Ahsan remarked that the price of water being used by sectors other than bottled water should also be fixed.

The bench observed that the Punjab government had devised a good plan as per the apex court's directions but only on paper. ""No political will is seen,"" Justice Ahsan remarked.

The apex court declared that the reply submitted by the Punjab government was an attempt to eyewash the judiciary and ordered the federal and provincial governments to submit a fresh response within 15 days.

Meanwhile, the commission's secretary said that the ICT administration also lacks a mechanism. He informed the court that the Capital Development Authority (CDA) charges a Rs100 water fee from each and every household, no matter how big or small it is.

The top judge expressed his displeasure over the situation and reprimanded the authority.

During an earlier hearing, the apex court had noted that the government of Sindh had set prices for the use of groundwater.

",2019-01-14,"IN December 2018, the Supreme Court of Pakistan passed an order that forced high-cost private schools to reduce any fees in excess of Rs5,000 by 20 per cent. The order itself was the outcome of a long and protracted battle, taken up by the court, on the insistence of protesting parents who stated that high-cost private schools were charging ‘extortionary’ fees, and subjecting them to arbitrary increases.

Last week, the court — specifically the outgoing chief justice — expressed his displeasure on hearing that high-cost private schools had started to cut back on extra- and co-curricular activities in the wake of its order. The court’s reaction appeared strange given that this was something everyone had predicted even before the price reduction was announced.

The issue of regulating fees in high-cost private schools is not a new one, and has produced considerable debate ever since the latest round of protests broke out around three years ago. Prior to the court’s intervention, it was also not an issue on which one could take a straightforward moral or policy decision. At its simplest, if high-cost private schools were subjecting their customers to exorbitant fee increases, (especially in tandem with one another as some have alleged), then as is the case with any private-sector enterprise some element of consumer protection and regulation is required.

What complicates it a bit (at least for some) is the moral dimension. Should education be treated like a car or a bar of soap? Does a normative component make schooling, especially in its societal function, appear as something distinctly sacred, and the act of wanton profiteering off it as somehow distinctly profane? To many, including myself, the idea of ‘selling’ education for profit appears abhorrent.

Should education be treated like a car or a bar of soap? To many, the idea of ‘selling’ education for profit appears abhorrent.

Education allows individuals to expand their capabilities and opportunities. Any version of a socially just society would not discriminate the attainment of these functions on the ability to pay.

At the same time though, one can recognise that the final responsibility for this distasteful situation lies largely with the state, which has both allowed for-profit activity in this sector, and encourages it to flourish by failing to carry out its own social welfare functions.

However, one must thank the court for inadvertently producing clarity on what has shown itself to be a difficult moral and policy conundrum otherwise. Whether one is theoretically in favour of regulating high-cost private schools or not, it is possible to agree that the way the court has done it may not be correct.

For starters, there is no actual principal at work here. The 20pc reduction does not fall in line with any broader framework of market regulation. In the absence of a detailed reasoning connected to financial forensics, we are left wondering about the basis of this particular number. Similarly, the Rs5,000 minimum at which it kicks in is also entirely arbitrary. Why are parents who send their kids to schools charging Rs4,999 being deprived of the court’s generosity?

Secondly, one does not need to be an economist to realise that price caps produce distortionary effects, and profit is usually the last thing compromised in such instances. Adding to the mess is the fact that school owners know that schooling as a product is relatively inelastic — it’s not easy to swap schools in the middle of a school year — so they can get away with reducing the quality of service provision. It may be the case that this is exactly what the intended message of an over-the-top-quality reduction is — a ploy to get the court to realise they do not agree with its decision. There are already reports circulating of class sizes being increased, teachers being laid off, and salaries being delayed. In the short to medium run those attending these schools will bear the cost of what was ironically intended to provide them with immediate relief.

Finally, as succinctly analysed by education researcher and academic, Minahil Asim, the court’s order carries no substantive redistributive function. Underpinning this point is the fact that the entire issue concerns a minuscule section of the population. As detailed in the short order, the brunt of the court’s attack is on large, high-cost private school chains like Lahore Grammar, City School, and Beaconhouse. Collectively, such schools cater to no more than a couple of per cent of the total school-going population.

The only reason why this is even an issue is because this couple of per cent lies at or near the top of the income distribution, and carries social and political heft, which is why its protests are heard by those in power. At the end of the day, the entire issue results in a short-term monetary transfer from privileged school owners to slightly less privileged upper-middle-class parents. And even that is offset by the reduction in quality schools are currently undertaking.

Without offering any sympathy for elite private school owners, and I certainly have none, one can see that as a policy instrument, arbitrary capping of profit for a small number of businesses is a strange moral crusade, especially when this has no positive spill-over for the rest of the population.

This is not to say there are no smart ways of regulating elite private schools — India and a host of other countries have instituted actual redistributive quotas for the underprivileged in such schools in order to expand quality educational opportunities. Similarly, from a consumer protection point of view, if there is collusion and cartelisation between elite school chains, the Competition Commission must be empowered to investigate and then, if needed, levy a punishment. The larger point here is that the issue needs to be approached holistically, with education, redistribution, and consumer protection forming key pillars of regulation. What is quite clear so far is that the current attempt has none of these as its basis.

",2019-01-14,"THE policy of keeping the rupee-dollar exchange rate fixed over extended periods of time, despite manifest signs of currency overvaluation, has not served Pakistan well. The parity was held around 60 during the Musharraf era, and around 100 in the recent Dar era. In both cases, unsustainable external deficits emerged, culminating in balance-of-payments crises requiring large shock devaluations and foreign bailouts to fix.

These intermittent currency crises are a major impediment to Pakistan’s long-term prosperity. They incentivise businesses to focus on short-term returns rather than long-term investments to boost the country’s economic potential. They deter foreign direct investors demanding macroeconomic stability and policy continuity as prerequisites. And, they weaken Pakistan’s geopolitical standing and sovereignty (bailouts are never a free lunch).

Yet, despite these nontrivial costs, we hardly see any ‘real-time’ opposition to this fixed rupee-dollar policy while it is in full implementation. One cannot recall any commentators (other than IFIs) clamouring for timely adjustment of the rupee during the Musharraf and Dar eras. And if this government decided to stabilise the exchange rate at 150 for the next three years, one expects few to object. Why? Because, unfortunately, the political economy is supportive of such a policy.

Pakistan’s opinion-makers are major beneficiaries of an artificially low rupee-dollar rate.

Pakistan’s opinion-makers are major beneficiaries of an artificially low rupee-dollar rate: it subsidises their spending on luxury imports (such as SUVs), children’s education abroad, and vacation travel. The masses don’t protest, as the more affordable import prices and lower inflation associated with an overvalued currency imply a quality of life improvement of sorts, albeit short-lived. Financing of the resulting higher imports/external deficits is also easier under a fixed parity as global banks generally lend in dollars.

One can ask why exporters do not protest the overvaluation policy. They probably do, but after years of import bias, the export lobby has weakened, and is overtaken in foreign exchange terms by overseas Pakistanis, whose remittances are largely insensitive to exchange rate movements.

The only way to break this unholy bias in favour of a low/fixed rupee-dollar parity is by raising awareness about its economic flaws and costs; and articulating an alternative currency regime to serve a volatile emerging market well. To this end, let’s examine why a fixed rupee-dollar parity makes little economic sense for Pakistan.

The correct measure of a country’s external competitiveness is its real, not nominal, exchange rate; the more appreciated the real exchange rate, the lower the country’s competitiveness, ceteris paribus. A percentage change in Pakistan’s real exchange rate equals the sum of: (i) the percentage change in the nominal exchange rate (where a more depreciated nominal exchange rate raises competitiveness); and (ii) the inflation rate differential between Pakistan and its trading partners (where a positive differential reduces competitiveness).

Assuming the US was Pakistan’s only trading partner, a stable rupee-dollar parity would guard against a loss in Pakistan’s competitiveness only if the inflation rates for Pakistan and the US are aligned. This is far from true: between mid-2013 (when the last IMF programme began) and end-2017, cumulative inflation amounted to 21 per cent in Pakistan vs 6pc in the US, implying a rupee overvaluation of 15pc vs the dollar alone.

But Pakistan did trade not only with the US; 92pc of our recent trade was with other economies, led by China (20pc), the Euro Area (12pc), UAE (11pc). Unfortunately, inflation (21pc) was also higher than these other trading partners’ inflation (8pc), exacerbating the rupee’s overvaluation. Moreover, the currencies of these other trading partners depreciated on average by 9pc against a rising dollar, so with the rupee tied to the dollar, there was also a nominal rupee appreciation vis-à-vis these economies. The combined effect was a 22pc real effective (ie trade weighted) appreciation of the rupee between mid-2013 and end-2017. (A table and a chart, on Pakistan’s trade share with its major trading partners, and real effective exchange rate path, are included in Dawn’s web version of this article.)

The foregoing provides a measure of the massive external imbalance that had accumulated under the last government, and which had to be fixed. The rupee’s nominal depreciation in 2018 of 33pc should deliver a good part of the needed real depreciation, though probably not all of it. Pakistan’s non-US trading partners’ and other competitors’ currencies have also depreciated against the US dollar in 2018 (by 5pc and 18pc respectively, in median terms). Thus, the net improvement in Pakistan’s competitiveness due to the 2018 nominal devaluation of 33pc is likely to have been less than the around 22pc required to remove the overvaluation. (A table on the nominal currency depreciation of several of Pakistan’s competitors has been included in the web version of this article.)

If a stable rupee-dollar framework is not appropriate for Pakistan, what is? We can get a clue from Pakistan’s competitors. Most allowed their exchange rates vis-à-vis the US dollar to adjust early in the 2013-17 period (median depreciation was 13pc). This timely adjustment helped them avoid the cliff drop of 33pc the rupee suffered in 2018.

There’s no reason why a similar, more flexible exchange rate regime, anchored in a basket of trading partner currencies (rather than a single currency), should not work well. However, a more flexible regime will bring its own imperatives. With a more volatile currency, the private sector will need access to better instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk. The government would be well advised to develop futures and forward options that financial institutions and traders can access at reasonable cost.

Finally, a credibly independent State Bank, and clear communication are needed to regain the severely dented market confidence. If markets do not believe in the announced exchange rate policy, it is not worth the paper it is written on. Markets can bet (and win) against a currency even when the latter is in line with fundamentals. And the experience of the UK’s Black Wednesday (Sept 16, 1992) has shown that no sovereign, however powerful, can survive the market’s onslaught.

",2019-01-14,"The Supreme Court on Monday upheld an Islamabad High Court (IHC) verdict that had ordered the suspension of prison sentences awarded to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in the Avenfield corruption reference.

A five-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, dismissed National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) plea against the high court's decision.

The apex court, in its ruling, said that NAB has failed to provide the ""ground for cancellation of bail"" and that the IHC had not exceeded its authority in granting bail to the convicts of the Avenfield reference.

Read: Avenfield House or ‘tax haven’ house?

The Supreme Court's decision brings a rare relief for the Sharif family, both of whose leaders — Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif — are currently incarcerated.

Maryam thanked ""Allah Almighty for today's decision"" but said that her ""true relief and happiness would be when my father comes back home.""

At the outset of the hearing today, the chief justice told NAB prosecutor Akram Qureshi to ""convince [the bench] why the high court's ruling should be suspended"".

The chief justice told the NAB counsel to delineate the grounds on which the apex court can suspend the granting of bail. ""Also tell us if the high court had the authority to suspend the sentence,"" he added.

Qureshi explained that his argument stood on the basis of earlier cases heard by the top court, claiming that bail can only be granted in the case of ""hardship"", which was not the reason behind IHC's verdict.

The NAB prosecutor pointed out that the IHC had questioned the merit of the trial in its judgement — something he said a high court cannot do in a bail plea.

Take a look: IHC surprised at ‘lapse’ by NAB in Avenfield case

""Nawaz Sharif was granted bail on the same grounds that had led to his conviction,"" observed Justice Gulzar Ahmed, who was also part of the bench. ""You did not challenge those grounds.""

Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, who is set to succeed Justice Nisar as the top judge, said that NAB's argument was not ""solid"" and rejected the claim that the high court had exceeded its authority.

He further said that the high court had mentioned that its ""observation was not final"".

The chief justice, however, told the NAB prosecutor that ""an interim order is never final and [it] never affects the final verdict either.""

In July 2018, an accountability court had handed Sharif 10 years as jail time for owning assets beyond known income and 1 year for not cooperating with NAB.

His daughter Maryam was given seven years for abetment after she was found ""instrumental in concealment of the properties of her father"" and one year for non-cooperation with the bureau. Meanwhile, Nawaz's son-in-law retired Captain Safdar has been given one year jail time — for not cooperating with NAB, and aiding and abeting Nawaz and Maryam.

In Sept 2018, the IHC had accepted the convicts' petitions and suspended the trio's respective prison sentences — a decision that the corruption watchdog had subsequently challenged in the apex court.",Haseeb Bhatti,"['supreme', 'court', 'monday', 'upheld', 'islamabad', 'high', 'court', 'ihc', 'verdict', 'ordered', 'suspension', 'prison', 'sentences', 'awarded', 'former', 'prime', 'minister', 'nawaz', 'sharif', 'daughter', 'maryam', 'nawaz', 'avenfield', 'corruption', 'reference', 'fivemember', 'bench', 'headed', 'chief', 'justice', 'pakistan', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'dismissed', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'nab', 'plea', 'high', 'court', 'decision', 'apex', 'court', 'ruling', 'said', 'nab', 'failed', 'provide', 'ground', 'cancellation', 'bail', 'ihc', 'exceeded', 'authority', 'granting', 'bail', 'convicts', 'avenfield', 'reference', 'read', 'avenfield', 'house', 'tax', 'house', 'supreme', 'court', 'decision', 'brings', 'rare', 'relief', 'sharif', 'family', 'whose', 'leaders', 'nawaz', 'sharif', 'shahbaz', 'sharif', 'currently', 'incarcerated', 'maryam', 'thanked', 'allah', 'almighty', 'today', 'decision', 'said', 'true', 'relief', 'happiness', 'would', 'father', 'comes', 'back', 'home', 'outset', 'hearing', 'today', 'chief', 'justice', 'told', 'nab', 'prosecutor', 'akram', 'qureshi', 'convince', 'bench', 'high', 'court', 'ruling', 'suspended', 'chief', 'justice', 'told', 'nab', 'counsel', 'delineate', 'grounds', 'apex', 'court', 'suspend', 'granting', 'bail', 'also', 'tell', 'us', 'high', 'court', 'authority', 'suspend', 'sentence', 'added', 'qureshi', 'explained', 'argument', 'stood', 'basis', 'earlier', 'cases', 'heard', 'top', 'court', 'claiming', 'bail', 'granted', 'case', 'hardship', 'reason', 'behind', 'ihc', 'verdict', 'nab', 'prosecutor', 'pointed', 'ihc', 'questioned', 'merit', 'trial', 'judgement', 'something', 'said', 'high', 'court', 'bail', 'plea', 'take', 'look', 'ihc', 'surprised', 'lapse', 'nab', 'avenfield', 'case', 'nawaz', 'sharif', 'granted', 'bail', 'grounds', 'led', 'conviction', 'observed', 'justice', 'gulzar', 'ahmed', 'also', 'part', 'bench', 'challenge', 'grounds', 'justice', 'asif', 'saeed', 'khosa', 'set', 'succeed', 'justice', 'nisar', 'top', 'judge', 'said', 'nab', 'argument', 'solid', 'rejected', 'claim', 'high', 'court', 'exceeded', 'authority', 'said', 'high', 'court', 'mentioned', 'observation', 'final', 'chief', 'justice', 'however', 'told', 'nab', 'prosecutor', 'interim', 'order', 'never', 'final', 'never', 'affects', 'final', 'verdict', 'either', 'july', '2018', 'accountability', 'court', 'handed', 'sharif', '10', 'years', 'jail', 'time', 'owning', 'assets', 'beyond', 'known', 'income', '1', 'year', 'cooperating', 'nab', 'daughter', 'maryam', 'given', 'seven', 'years', 'abetment', 'found', 'instrumental', 'concealment', 'properties', 'father', 'one', 'year', 'noncooperation', 'bureau', 'meanwhile', 'nawaz', 'soninlaw', 'retired', 'captain', 'safdar', 'given', 'one', 'year', 'jail', 'time', 'cooperating', 'nab', 'aiding', 'abeting', 'nawaz', 'maryam', 'sept', '2018', 'ihc', 'accepted', 'convicts', 'petitions', 'suspended', 'trio', 'respective', 'prison', 'sentences', 'decision', 'corruption', 'watchdog', 'subsequently', 'challenged', 'apex', 'court']","['sc', 'upholds', 'ihc', 'verdict', 'dismisses', 'nab', 'appeal', 'suspension', 'sharifs', 'sentences', 'avenfield', 'case']"
113,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457471/mentally-ill-ex-cop-khizar-hayats-case-forwarded-to-larger-bench-for-hearing,"Mentally ill ex-cop Khizar Hayat's case forwarded to larger bench for hearing
",2019-01-14,"A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court Lahore registry on Monday while hearing an appeal for the suspension of the death sentence of mentally-ill prisoner Khizar Hayat forwarded the matter to a larger bench for hearing and adjourned the case for an indefinite period.

Hayat, a former police constable, was convicted in October 2001 for killing a fellow policeman. He was sentenced to death by a trial court in 2003. He has spent nearly 15 years on death row. Hayat was first diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic in 2008 by jail medical authorities.

In 2010, the jail medical officer recommended that Hayat needed specialised treatment and should be shifted to the psychiatric facility. However, this was never done. In 2017, the Lahore High Court (LHC) had stayed the execution of Hayat, but rejected his mother's appeal for a stay in December 2018.

Last week, a district and sessions court in Lahore fixed Hayat's execution for Jan 15.

On Saturday, Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had taken notice of the issuing of a death warrant for Hayat and sought a report to ascertain his ailment, suspending his sentence until further orders. He had also directed the law officer to verify whether the condemned prisoner was mentally ill.

A two-member bench comprising Justices Manzoor Ahmad Malik and Sardar Tariq Masood heard the appeal for suspension of Hayat's death sentence filed by his mother Iqbal Bano. Jail officials and a mental health specialist were in court today, along with Hayat's lawyer.

The lawyer contended before the bench that the Supreme Court had halted executions in similar cases in the past.

""But why wasn't the state of his mental health raised earlier during the trial?"" Justice Manzoor Ahmad Malik asked. ""Why, when he is set to be punished, is the point being raised?""

The lawyer responded that Hayat had been diagnosed with schizophrenia during the trial, adding that a six-member medical board had been set up in 2016 to examine his mental health and confirmed that he had a mental illness.

According to Section 444 of the jail rules, a person with a mental illness cannot be executed, the lawyer argued.

""Do you believe that Hayat's mental state is not right?"" Justice Malik asked the doctor in court.

""Khizar Hayat is suffering from a mental illness,"" replied Dr Mubashir, adding that a medical board could be set up to examine his mental state.

""In this state, the subject does not know what he is doing,"" the doctor added.

The jail official apprised the court that Hayat was being held at the hospital at Kot Lakhpat jail.

Justice Malik noted that Hayat's medical report is not completely clear. He appeared wary that other convicts would start appealing against their convictions using mental illness as a pretext.

""We're sending the matter to a larger bench,"" he added.

The court subsequently ordered that the appeal against Hayat's execution be forwarded to a larger bench, and adjourned the case indefinitely.

Mother challenges death sentence

Khizar Hayat's mother, Iqbal Bano, in her appealing challenging her son's death sentence, had requested the chief justice to visit the Kot Lakhpat jail ward for mentally ill prisoners and investigate what medicines were being given to her son.

She pleaded that his medical records be investigated ""to determine why his treatment was not being done properly and why his condition was worsening day by day"".

The appeal also challenged the LHC division bench's 2018 judgement, and sought a stay on Hayat's execution. It said the judgement passed by the division bench was not in accordance with law and the prison rules. It said the bench mixed the conviction with execution and thereby dismissed the petition on wrong premises.

It stated that the bench had not appreciated the extensive medical history of the appellant’s son as well as the reports of the medical boards establishing the mental ailment of Hayat.

The appeal argued that a condemned prisoner could not be executed in utter disregard of the prison rules on the subject. It pleaded that the government had a legal duty under the Prisons Rules 1978 to provide the appellant’s son with adequate and appropriate treatment for his mental illness at a psychiatric facility. To deny him this treatment was an arbitrary abuse of power and a violation of Articles 9, 14 and 25 of the Constitution, it contested.",dawn,"['twojudge', 'bench', 'supreme', 'court', 'lahore', 'registry', 'monday', 'hearing', 'appeal', 'suspension', 'death', 'sentence', 'mentallyill', 'prisoner', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'forwarded', 'matter', 'larger', 'bench', 'hearing', 'adjourned', 'case', 'indefinite', 'period', 'hayat', 'former', 'police', 'constable', 'convicted', 'october', '2001', 'killing', 'fellow', 'policeman', 'sentenced', 'death', 'trial', 'court', '2003', 'spent', 'nearly', '15', 'years', 'death', 'row', 'hayat', 'first', 'diagnosed', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenic', '2008', 'jail', 'medical', 'authorities', '2010', 'jail', 'medical', 'officer', 'recommended', 'hayat', 'needed', 'specialised', 'treatment', 'shifted', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'however', 'never', 'done', '2017', 'lahore', 'high', 'court', 'lhc', 'stayed', 'execution', 'hayat', 'rejected', 'mother', 'appeal', 'stay', 'december', '2018', 'last', 'week', 'district', 'sessions', 'court', 'lahore', 'fixed', 'hayat', 'execution', 'jan', '15', 'saturday', 'chief', 'justice', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'taken', 'notice', 'issuing', 'death', 'warrant', 'hayat', 'sought', 'report', 'ascertain', 'ailment', 'suspending', 'sentence', 'orders', 'also', 'directed', 'law', 'officer', 'verify', 'whether', 'condemned', 'prisoner', 'mentally', 'ill', 'twomember', 'bench', 'comprising', 'justices', 'manzoor', 'ahmad', 'malik', 'sardar', 'tariq', 'masood', 'heard', 'appeal', 'suspension', 'hayat', 'death', 'sentence', 'filed', 'mother', 'iqbal', 'bano', 'jail', 'officials', 'mental', 'health', 'specialist', 'court', 'today', 'along', 'hayat', 'lawyer', 'lawyer', 'contended', 'bench', 'supreme', 'court', 'halted', 'executions', 'similar', 'cases', 'past', 'nt', 'state', 'mental', 'health', 'raised', 'earlier', 'trial', 'justice', 'manzoor', 'ahmad', 'malik', 'asked', 'set', 'punished', 'point', 'raised', 'lawyer', 'responded', 'hayat', 'diagnosed', 'schizophrenia', 'trial', 'adding', 'sixmember', 'medical', 'board', 'set', '2016', 'examine', 'mental', 'health', 'confirmed', 'mental', 'illness', 'according', 'section', '444', 'jail', 'rules', 'person', 'mental', 'illness', 'executed', 'lawyer', 'argued', 'believe', 'hayat', 'mental', 'state', 'right', 'justice', 'malik', 'asked', 'doctor', 'court', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'suffering', 'mental', 'illness', 'replied', 'dr', 'mubashir', 'adding', 'medical', 'board', 'could', 'set', 'examine', 'mental', 'state', 'state', 'subject', 'know', 'doctor', 'added', 'jail', 'official', 'apprised', 'court', 'hayat', 'held', 'hospital', 'kot', 'lakhpat', 'jail', 'justice', 'malik', 'noted', 'hayat', 'medical', 'report', 'completely', 'clear', 'appeared', 'wary', 'convicts', 'would', 'start', 'appealing', 'convictions', 'using', 'mental', 'illness', 'pretext', 'sending', 'matter', 'larger', 'bench', 'added', 'court', 'subsequently', 'ordered', 'appeal', 'hayat', 'execution', 'forwarded', 'larger', 'bench', 'adjourned', 'case', 'indefinitely', 'mother', 'challenges', 'death', 'sentence', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'mother', 'iqbal', 'bano', 'appealing', 'challenging', 'son', 'death', 'sentence', 'requested', 'chief', 'justice', 'visit', 'kot', 'lakhpat', 'jail', 'ward', 'mentally', 'ill', 'prisoners', 'investigate', 'medicines', 'given', 'son', 'pleaded', 'medical', 'records', 'investigated', 'determine', 'treatment', 'done', 'properly', 'condition', 'worsening', 'day', 'day', 'appeal', 'also', 'challenged', 'lhc', 'division', 'bench', '2018', 'judgement', 'sought', 'stay', 'hayat', 'execution', 'said', 'judgement', 'passed', 'division', 'bench', 'accordance', 'law', 'prison', 'rules', 'said', 'bench', 'mixed', 'conviction', 'execution', 'thereby', 'dismissed', 'petition', 'wrong', 'premises', 'stated', 'bench', 'appreciated', 'extensive', 'medical', 'history', 'appellant', 'son', 'well', 'reports', 'medical', 'boards', 'establishing', 'mental', 'ailment', 'hayat', 'appeal', 'argued', 'condemned', 'prisoner', 'could', 'executed', 'utter', 'disregard', 'prison', 'rules', 'subject', 'pleaded', 'government', 'legal', 'duty', 'prisons', 'rules', '1978', 'provide', 'appellant', 'son', 'adequate', 'appropriate', 'treatment', 'mental', 'illness', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'deny', 'treatment', 'arbitrary', 'abuse', 'power', 'violation', 'articles', '9', '14', '25', 'constitution', 'contested']","['mentally', 'ill', 'excop', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'case', 'forwarded', 'larger', 'bench', 'hearing']"

",2019-01-14,"A JIT CULTURE that appears to have developed in the country — institutions and political parties seeking ad hoc, intelligence agencies-driven Joint Investigation Teams to probe all manner of public malfeasance and corruption — has been carried to a mirthful new level.

Criticising the electricity and gas shortages in the country, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Saturday demanded the formation of a JIT to probe who is responsible for the ongoing energy crisis. Perhaps Mr Abbasi was speaking in a lighter vein, but other political leaders do not appear to share Mr Abbasi’s humour.

Also read: JIT deletion

Revelations last week that a sister of Prime Minister Imran Khan has more previously undisclosed properties abroad resulted in some opposition leaders immediately demanding that a JIT be formed and Mr Khan’s sister be placed on the ECL. It appears that the leading opposition parties, the PML-N and the PPP, believe that since their leaders have been subjected to unfair JIT processes, the PTI must suffer similarly.

The opposition is wrong. The emergence of JITs is a trend that ought to discouraged, not encouraged. While in certain cases a JIT may be merited, its extensive and unrestrained use undermines normal institutional processes.

Moreover, the intelligence component which gives JITs a perceived weight in certain quarters acts to further muddy institutional waters, renders murky the separation of powers and adds to a perception of civil-military tensions in the country. As the Supreme Court itself has reiterated in recent days in the wake of the controversy over the JIT report on the so-called fake banks account case, a JIT report is not a conclusive finding of fact.

At most, a JIT report can be a starting point for the investigation and prosecution aides of the legal process. And it is in those areas — investigation and prosecution — that the state should concentrate its reform efforts. An effective accountability process is one whose foundations are strong institutions as opposed to ad hoc attempted solutions.

At a time when parliament may take up the issue of again extending the life of military courts for civilians accused of terrorism by the state, would it not further the democratic project by debating and implementing meaningful investigation, prosecution and judicial reforms?

At the moment, the politicisation of JITs virtually ensures that their findings and recommendations are immediately denounced as partisan. The politicisation also helps the political class avoid providing adequate explanations in the court of public opinion — politicians have spent more time attacking the formation and composition of JITs than answering the allegations set out in JIT reports.

If accountability is to be fair, transparent and across the board the process of accountability must be through a stronger institutional framework.

",2019-01-14,"Freelance reporter Asad Hashim was named as winner of the 2018 Agence France-Presse Kate Webb Prize on Monday for his coverage of the plight of ethnic Pashtuns and blasphemy issues in his native Pakistan.

The award, named after one of AFP's finest correspondents, recognises journalism by locally-hired reporters in Asia operating in risky or difficult conditions.

Hashim, 33, was honoured for a series of articles on ethnic Pashtuns and other minority groups caught in the crossfire of Pakistan's fight against militants.

Take a look: The cold emptiness of South Waziristan

These included an investigative report into enforced disappearances allegedly conducted by the country's powerful military and a reporting mission to the South Waziristan tribal region — birthplace of Pakistan's Taliban — to look into the civilian toll from landmines.

Pakistan has battled homegrown militancy for nearly 15 years, with tens of thousands of people killed, and insurgents retain the ability to carry out devastating attacks despite recent improvements in security.

“These are challenging times for journalists in Pakistan, and Asad Hashim's work stands out for the kind of courageous, independent reporting the Kate Webb Prize was created to recognise,” said AFP Asia-Pacific regional director Philippe Massonnet.

“His deeply-researched articles tackle sensitive subjects with an admirable balance of passion, commitment and journalistic detachment.”

The award also recognised his work on other highly sensitive issues, such as Pakistan's blasphemy laws and the country's judicial system.

“I am honoured by the jury's decision to select my work this year,” Hashim said after learning he was the winner of the 2018 prize.

“I consider the award not just a recognition of my work, but of all Pakistani journalists, who have been working in an increasingly restrictive reporting environment over the last year.”

The Kate Webb Prize, with a $3,400 purse, honours journalists working in perilous or difficult conditions in Asia, and is named after a crusading AFP reporter who died in 2007 at the age of 64, after a career covering the world's troublespots.

",2019-01-14,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar on Monday assailed an audit member of the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) for the body's ""sluggish"" investigation in the case against 44 politically exposed individuals or their benamidars who own properties abroad.

At the outset of the case today, the FBR representative told the court that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had provided data of 895 people and 1,365 properties. About 360 people took advantage of tax amnesty scheme to protect 484 properties, he added.

The FBR audit member further said that Rs340 million have so far been recovered, while the recovery of another Rs768m is expected.

The progress of the case did not impress the chief justice. ""You have all the data; you should have taken action within hours,"" he said, adding that the matter would never have been taken up if the court had not taken notice.

The FBR member apprised the court that 157 people have still not come forward and that the FBR has written to the Dubai authority for their data.

Meanwhile, a report submitted in the court by the FIA claimed that 1,211 Pakistani citizens own 2,154 properties in the UAE. A further 345 people have been served notices, the report said.

The report also said that 61 people remain unidentified, five are deceased, 10 are uncooperative while one is absconding.

Furthermore, the FIA report said that 413 people took advantage of the tax amnesty scheme that ended in August last year, whereas 167 people declared their properties to the FBR inquiry officer.

It stated that 79 people declared their properties in tax returns filed for the FBR, while 97 people disowned their properties in the UAE. Previously, the FIA had identified 1,115 people who owned properties in the UAE.

Prime Minister Imran Khan's sister Aleema Khanum, who is named as one of the benamidars of a property in the United Arab Emirates, was also present in the court for today's hearing. The court had ordered Khanum to appear in person today.

Talking to the media after the hearing, Khanum regretted that people were poking fun at ""the machines that employ hundreds and thousands of people"".

""You can check [my] wealth statement, I have earned for myself after working for 20 years,"" she claimed.

The minor brothers, Ahmad, 1.5-years-old, and Muhammad, 5-years-old, had died in November 2018 after the family dined out at Zamzama's Arizona Grill restaurant and afterwards consumed candy from a shop outside an amusement park on Seaview. The children had started vomiting after consuming food which caused dehydration, kidney failure and eventually death.

Police had initiated a probe into the matter and the restaurant was sealed for forensic investigation. Multiple samples of food collected from the restaurant, the victims' house as well as from the bodies were sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency as well as SGS Korangi for examination.

A Sindh High Court bench on Monday resumed hearing the bail application of the two suspects arrested in the case.

The parents of the deceased children appeared in court today and said they had forgiven those responsible and didn't wish to take any further action.

The lawyer for the restaurant also apprised the court of a compromise being reached between both parties.

A lab report that the court had earlier asked for was submitted in court today by the Sindh Food Authority. The report concluded that the children had died of poisoning. It explained that there was a high quantity of E.coli bacteria found in the expired meat recovered from the restaurant.

",2019-01-14,"The Supreme Court on Monday disposed of the 2014 Army Public School (APS) carnage case after being briefed on the progress made by a judicial commission probing the matter.

In the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history, 131 schoolchildren and 10 other people were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the APS on Dec 16, 2014.

Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had taken a suo motu notice of the APS case in April when parents of some martyred students, including mothers, approached him while he was hearing other cases in Peshawar.

The parents had complained that a few weeks before the attack, the authorities had been alerted by the National Counter Terrorism Authority to the possibility of an attack on an army-run institution, but no measures had been taken to prevent the attack.

The parents pointed out that they had been demanding justice for the last three years and had been calling for the appointment of a judicial commission to look into the incident, but to no avail.

“We cannot bring back the near and dear ones who lost their lives but at least we can lessen the agony and grief of the victim families to some extent,” Chief Justice Nisar had remarked during a hearing in October, ordering the formation of a commission with instructions to file a report after a thorough inquiry lasting six weeks.

At the outset of the hearing today, the chief justice recalled that the court had formed a commission, and enquired if it has submitted its report.

Advocate general Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told Justice Nisar that 147 testimonies have been recorded but another 109 are still pending.

",2019-01-14,"AS the current chief justice’s tenure comes to a close, the news of extrajudicial actions taken in that time has far exceeded the news of the many regular judicial decisions taken therein. This last occurred during the tenure of Iftikhar Chaudhry as chief justice.

Many articles have been written by lawyers arguing the merits and demerits of the actions of both chiefs. Proponents of this method of ‘judicial governance’ argue that overreach is necessary where the executive is so deeply flawed.

Read more: CJP’s order termed void days before his retirement

Critics argue that there is no difference between overreach by the judiciary and overreach by similarly unelected forces.

Proponents of the Chaudhry regime who forgave its flaws only because its aims were anti-establishment find themselves in the other camp when faced with the ‘established and united’ might of the dam-funding Justice Nisar.

Critics argue this is the natural fallout of accepting the populist suo motu-ism on bottles of wine as propagated by Chaudhry.

Also read: Why 2018 was CJP Nisar's year

However, the most critical similarity is perhaps the evolution of the personal ethos of both men and how it underwent such a tremendous and perhaps mysterious change in an age where the minds of normal, lesser men are set and rigid.

Why would a judge suddenly go against his own ethos?

Some brilliant arguments were made after the reversal of the houbara bustard hunting ban judgement. The about-face came immediately post the short Jawwad Khwaja tenure as chief justice. It was argued that such a frequent change of mind dilutes the power of the judiciary as a whole and exhibits a political change of heart rather than a change of the judicial mind.

Take a look: Chief justice cautions politicians against 'undermining judiciary'

Justice Nisar was one of four judges out of the 17-member bench of the Supreme Court who dissented against any idea of a ‘basic structure’ or salient features in our Constitution. In what orthodox legal minds would consider his finest hour, a full-throated critique from Justice Nisar of such a restriction, upon what he viewed to be the absolute right of the people, included the following: “If we were to introduce such a doctrine into Pakistan would not critics be entitled to speculate whether the nation has changed a military autocracy for a judicial autocracy, with but a brief interval for an improperly functioning democracy.”

When critiquing the power the Indian supreme court now enjoyed over parliament, Justice Nisar wrote: “This is of course a completely unprecedented display of ‘judicial’ power — power in its most naked form. Not merely unchecked, but uncheckable, since there are no means of checking it known to the laws of any civilised system of jurisprudence. This is a malady for which there is no remedy and an ailment for which there is no cure short of a complete uprooting of the judicial and democratic system. A power so vast, so all embracing, can hardly be conceived by any democratic system of governance resting on the basic principle of checks and balances.”

What then is the process by which a senior judge after assuming the ultimate seat of his office begins to rewrite theories he has personally expressed and endorsed throughout his tenure? For Chaudhry, servility had got him as far as the Supreme Court and it was going to take him no further. It was time to bare teeth to who had until then been the master, and an undercurrent of resentment already existed to help those teeth sink in deeper than they otherwise would have. A seven-year tenure as chief ahead of him, extraordinary because of the nature of his own appointment, convinced his activism and steeled it.

But what of Justice Nisar — rose through the merit of his acumen rather than his politics, authored fundamental judgements which limited the authoritarian functioning of federal government through the prime minister and his bureaucracy. He opined strictly against judicial overreach.

What makes such a man suddenly demand money for a personal pride project that he admittedly has no expertise about? What is the difference between endorsing a large dam without adequate research into its viability or feasibility, and endorsing Agha Waqar’s water kit?

Why would a judge who has personally espoused judicial restraint, written it into the body of the most famous judgements he was part of; suddenly go against his own ethos?

What made him suddenly become a jurist who threatened parties with the demolition of their premises or other criminal sanction unless they deposited money into ‘his’ dam fund? What made him the weekend warrior who held conferences on population control? What personal need for publicity or expression could suddenly arise in a man whose office was already his, and limited to a term predefined? What made or compelled this brilliant and conservative adjudicator to suddenly become this populist and activist force?

The answer to these questions may be singular; and will most certainly determine his legacy.

121,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457467/what-do-pakistan-and-china-want-from-cpec-going-forward,"What do Pakistan and China want from CPEC going forward?
",2019-01-14,"China and Pakistan have made strides — particularly in electricity and infrastructure projects — in the first three-year phase of their cooperation under the multi-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Both countries have had good and not-so-good experiences and are learning about each other’s strengths and deficiencies as they try to build upon lessons learnt.

At the conclusion of the recently held eighth meeting of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC), they agreed to conduct at least five in-depth sector studies for future investment cooperation under the framework as Islamabad pursues more financial support and Beijing seeks increased facilitation, improved security and a smooth repayment mechanism. In addition, “both sides agreed to make joint efforts to improve the overall media environment for CPEC cooperation”.

Pakistan made a formal request to the JCC — the highest decision-making body on the CPEC — for “more grant, investment, joint ventures and concessional loan arrangements to strengthen and fast track” transport infrastructure, industrial cooperation and socio-economic development.

Beijing is annoyed at the Sindh government for slow progress on Karachi Circular Railway, which it considers critical for the city’s prosperity

China’s focus during the meeting that ended on Dec 20 was more on putting in place a mechanism that ensures smooth repayments given Pakistan’s financial constraints. It expects Islamabad to further strengthen the security structure and take targeted measures to reduce the threat of terrorism by speeding up the building and deployment of Special Security Division-South. Beijing is also pushing more vigorously for the removal of irritants in the implementation of existing projects.

Led jointly by Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, and Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar, minister for planning, development reforms, meeting participants appreciated that the CPEC had achieved important milestones of early-harvest projects (EHP) and was now entering a new development stage.

The in-depth studies will be on Pakistan’s power market, a cascade study for hydropower projects all along the Jhelum River, optimisation of overall energy mix, an oil and gas industry development plan and a five-year action plan for cooperation on the highway between China and Pakistan as part of the joint traffic density study.

“(The) results of a joint study on power market of Pakistan will be fundamental for deciding the next step of energy cooperation.” The working on the study has just begun. Pakistan has committed to putting into operation all transmission lines required for the evacuation of energy well before CPEC projects achieve commercial operations to avoid penalties.

The payment of outstanding tariffs for the operational energy projects is a source of irritation for China. The two sides agreed to have scientific planning and amicable negotiations to address the issues arising from energy cooperation and create a common panel under the joint working group on energy for monthly formal and informal communications and consultations.

Pakistan promised a timely recovery of bills from consumers as part of the ongoing campaign to reduce line losses and improve collection through reforms and new technology. But Pakistan also wanted Chinese technical support with respect to technology. A comprehensive technical study will also be carried out to increase the production capacity of the surface mine in the Thar coalfield.

Pakistan has demanded that a major 1,320-megawatt Rahimyar Khan project under CPEC be scrapped on the ground that its next-stage priority was using domestic sources of energy. Hence, the need for maximum benefits from the Jhelum River flows by optimising the combined operation of all cascade projects there.

On the industrial side, China asked Pakistan that the Board of Investment should act as lead agency for industrial development and ensure land, energy, taxation, customs, law and other services from the relevant departments to deal with land prices, park development models and infrastructure services.

Rashakai in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Dhabeji in Thatta and M3 in Faisalabad have been selected as special industrial zones for the first phase of development. They will promote Chinese investments in key industries, like textile, petro-chemical and iron and steel.

In infrastructure, both sides are happy with the progress on two big projects: $8.2 billion Mainline (ML-1) from Karachi to Khyber and $2bn Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) besides Eastbay Expressway Gwadar and security arrangements for them. Pakistan has promised to ensure timely land acquisition and demolition for the project implementation.

The preliminary design of ML-1 will be ready this month. The project will be implemented in line with the framework agreement signed in May 2017. This means China will provide up to 85 per cent of the project cost as a loan as opposed to a “build-operate-transfer” model proposed by the PTI government to shift financial responsibility on to the private sector and keep government loans on the lower side.

Beijing is annoyed about slow progress on KCR by the provincial government despite the project being critical and feasible for the growth and prosperity of the country’s largest city. Mass transit projects for Quetta and Peshawar have been put on the back burner for the time being because of a lack of preparedness. These will be taken up once their PC-1s are approved by the relevant government forums.

Noting full operational capability of the Gwadar Port, the two sides agreed to continuously pay high attention to it. Weekly container liner services are calling the port as coal trans-shipment and clinker export take place. The JCC appreciated progress on the Gwadar Free Zone. It agreed to jointly make more efforts to attract qualified companies to invest in the area.

Pakistan was required to provide agreed tax and tariff mechanisms to create a good investment environment leading to the next phase. The two sides have failed so far to finalise the Gwadar Smart City Master Plan, but promised to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the New Gwadar International Port before March 2019.

",2019-01-14,"PESHAWAR: The 352nd birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh was celebrated here on Sunday amid tight security and people from various minority groups participated in the event.

The celebrations in connection with the birth anniversary had commenced on Friday and concluded in Gurdwara Bhai Joga Singh at Mohallah Jogan Shah Qissa Khwani, Peshawar, on Sunday.

According to a statement, the three-day event was organised by the Auqaf, Religious and Minority Affairs Department, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, to show harmony and celebrate inclusiveness.

Auqaf secretary says budget allocated for religious festivals of minorities

On the first day, a procession was held which was marked by rendering of hymns by Sikh community, including men and women. Over 5,000 Sikh devotees from across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took part in the procession and then other rituals followed by Langar (feast).

Adequate measures were put in place by the police department to ensure full security for smooth celebration of the event.

The chief guests included MPAs Ravi Kumar and Wazirzada and Sikh community leader Ranjeet Singh besides some government officials. The major attraction of the procession was the display of ‘Gatka,’ a famous Sikh martial art and other sword exercises.

On this occasion, MPA Ravi Kumar paid tribute to the slain Soran Singh and said that his services as adviser to the chief minister and his personal efforts for the communities would always be remembered.

He also said that such events would build understanding of traditions and beliefs of minorities and people here had shown a sign of interfaith harmony. In response to the demand of Sikh community, he said that Shamshan Ghat would soon be set up.

In this regard, MPA Wazirzada said that celebration of minorities’ events would help spread love and peace. He maintained that the minorities were allowed to practice their religion freely. Auqaf department secretary Hidayat Jan stated that they had allocated budget for religious festivals of minorities of KP. Guru Gobind Singh was the 10th Sikh Guru, a spiritual master and philosopher.

",2019-01-14,"PESHAWAR: The World Health Organisation, which is providing technical assistance to the authorities to streamline healthcare financing in all provinces and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, will help them to put in place a uniform programme of free healthcare across the country.

A mission of WHO including Prof Soonman, Dr Faraz Khalid and Dr Mohammad Saeed Akbar Khan held discussions with the officials of health and finance departments during a visit to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recently.

The mission, which reached Pakistan on January 8, 2019 on the government’s invitation to streamline its healthcare financing system, also visited other provinces and later presented its recommendations to Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (NHSRC) regarding improvement in the system.

The health department officials told Dawn that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had launched Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP) two years ago that benefitted about 150,000 patients. Under it, each household of eight persons is entitled to get services up to Rs540,000 but still there is room for improvement.

The government pays premium to the insurance company, but the latter retains 20 per cent of the unspent amount at the end of the year and returns 80 per cent to the former. The health department wants that entire amount should be spent on patients’ health and profit margin by the company should be reduced.

As the government has designated about 100 private and state-run hospitals to treat people under the SSP, but bulk of the amount goes to the private sector because of prompt services being provided to the patients there.

In the government hospitals, the doctors and other staff involved in the treatment of SSP’s patients don’t get any additional benefits due to which they are least interested in their treatment, according to sources.

“The WHO has been providing technical assistance to the government to offer quality healthcare services to families living below the poverty line through free of cost health insurance programmes and is devising strategy to bring uniformity among the programmes run by federal government and province, especially SSP in KP,” said officials.

They said that those initiatives were steps towards realisation of the WHO’s Universal Health Coverage, which needed to be ensured in the face of hefty rise in public sector expenditure as well as high cost of medicines. Not only these programmes ensure that the under-privileged citizens across the country get access to quality medical services in a swift and dignified manner, but it also ascertains, by preventing the catastrophic expenditures on health, that poor families do not slip further down the poverty line.

The world health agency has conducted a ‘health financing diagnostic review’ of social health protection initiatives to plan for further public sector funding and sustainability of these initiatives, specifically undertaking an in-depth diagnostic analysis of the health financing system in the country by taking into consideration the developed political arrangement and identifying the challenges including raising, managing and using financial health resources.

According to officials, the WHO’s visit was aimed at generating a policy dialogue to promote more public money for health by undertaking a fiscal space analysis for the health sector and identifying alternative relevant resource mobilisation arrangements.

Pakistan has sought WHO’s technical cooperation to develop a federal health financing policy that could be used in the formulation of provincial health financing strategies. The UN health agency will also extend cooperation to the government in designing and implementing the health insurance programme in the provinces to enhance financial protection goal for the poor.

",2019-01-14,"PESHAWAR: The austerity drive of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is likely to sweep away wildlife department as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa environment department has moved a summary to merge it with the forest department.

Minister for Environment Syed Mohammad Ishtiaq said that summary regarding merger of the two departments was forwarded to chief minister and chief secretary on Friday last. The cabinet will approve the summary. He said that merger of Forest Development Corporation with forest department was also on the cards to avoid overlapping and streamline the affairs.

“The purpose of merger of the two departments is to save resources and share responsibilities among employees to protect forests as well as wildlife,” the minister told Dawn.

Proposal shocks wildlife conservators

The wildlife department was set up in 1995. Before, it was functioning under the umbrella of forest department in the name of ‘game wing’. The government will amend the relevant laws for merger of the two departments.

The environment department’s proposal shocked wildlife conservators, who termed the move “very damaging” for the management of wildlife in the province.

“This decision will affect wildlife management,”’ said Dr Mumtaz Malik, former chief conservator and founder of the department. He added that wildlife would go back to zero after merger of the two departments.

“A department, which got national and international recognitions and introduced activities like trophy hunting of wild species, established national parks, wildlife parks and conservancies, is being abolished in the name of merger,” he said.

An expert associated with an international conservation body said that wildlife would lose its identity and specialised staff if an established department was abolished. “The government should not wind up an established department,” he said, adding that those two disciplines were separated in 1970s.

More than 1,000 employees of the wildlife department would be put at the disposal of forest department. In addition, the post of chief conservator of wildlife department would stand abolished after the merger.

The department is currently managing seven national parks including Lulusar-Dudipatsar, Chitral Gol, Broghil Valley, Ayubia, Saiful Muluk and Sheikh Badin. Setting up of national parks not only improved natural habitats but also moved some rare species like snow leopard and markhor from the endangered to vulnerable categories with the support of local communities.

If cabinet approves the merger, chief conservator forests will look after both flora and fauna in the province including thousands of hectors of national parks, wildlife parks, conservancies, game reserves and wetlands etc. The post of chief conservator of wildlife will also be dissolved, according to the summary.

The previous government of PTI had made a comprehensive law called Wildlife and Biodiversity (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Act, 2015. Forest and wildlife operate under the umbrella of environment department. The previous government had announced three more national parks in the province.

Minister Ishtiaq said that the merger would not only save resources, but would also resolve the issue of duplication. He expected over Rs30 million saving for the government annually after merger of the two departments. “The problem is that employees of the two departments evade responsibilities and ignore offences in their areas of jurisdiction,” he said.

He said that officials of the wildlife remained indifferent when they came across any forest-related offences during duty and same was the case with forest staff in connection with wildlife offences.

But officials disagreed with the minister’s remarks and alleged that some vested interests in the forest department were trying to increase “grazing area” for themselves in the name of merger. They said that forest and wildlife were two different subjects, which required specialised expertise and qualifications and experts in forestry did not understand wildlife.

“How a department (forest), which can’t protect forests, will look after wildlife and its attached sectors,” questioned an official. He said that wildlife department had prosecuted over 62 offences in various courts for violation in Ayubia National Park as more than 200 cases were reported in other national parks of the province.

",2019-01-14,"RAWALPINDI: Federal Minister for National Health Services Aamer Mehmood Kiani here on Sunday defended the recent increase in medicine prices and linked it with the devaluation of the rupee against the dollar.

“We will reduce the drug prices when the value of the dollar drops against the rupee. As medicines are imported, the devaluation of the rupee necessitated the increase in the prices,” he told media persons after visiting the Holy Family Hospital (HFH).

The minister said pharmaceutical companies had demanded an increase of 30pc in the drug prices but the government agreed only to 15pc.

Says prices will be reduced when value of dollar drops against the rupee

The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) on Jan 11 announced up to 15pc increase in the prices of various medicines. The surge drew criticism from the citizens and the opposition parties who demanded the government withdraw the decision as it would create problems for the people.

The minister said healthcare was ignored in the past but the PTI government was giving special attention to the sector at the direction of Prime Minister Imran Khan. He said the prime minister wanted to provide better healthcare facilities to the citizens in all government hospitals.

The minister said more than 20 million health cards would be issued by the end of this month.

“These health cards will enable the citizens to receive medical treatment both at the government and private hospitals,” he said, adding the financial package under the health cards had also been doubled.

The government is working to establish three new hospitals and a nursing university in Islamabad to lessen the patient load on the existing hospitals.

He said after the visit of the prime minister to the HFH, 100 new beds were being added to its mother and child department.

He said the prime minister expressed his concerns after seeing two or three expecting mothers sharing a single bed in the hospital.

“The prime minister assigned me the task to improve the facilities in the hospital so patients could get better healthcare facilities without any hurdle,” he said.

“More than three million people get medical care annually at the HFH and it will be made a state-of-the-art hospital.”

He said for patient attendants, a shelter home was being constructed and such a facility would also be provided at Benazir Bhutto Hospital and District Headquarters Hospital.

The minister said incubators, baby carts, warmers and other facilities were also being provided to the hospital.

“The Punjab government has been asked to ensure supply of medicines to the government hospitals,” he said.

The government will also recruit more staff to overcome the shortage in the hospitals. He said 150 employees would be recruited to improve the sanitation facilities at the HFH soon. He said new washrooms would also be constructed in the hospital.

The minister said he was monitoring the work at the hospital and the residents would seen the change within a week. He said special counters had been established at the hospital to resolve complaints of the patients.

",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Education has decided to fill only six of the 14 vacant Pakistan chairs in foreign universities.

The ministry recently stopped the process of sending shortlisted candidates to represent Pakistan in 14 foreign universities. The candidates were finalised by a committee headed by Senator Syed Muzafar Hussain Shah last year.

The education ministry now has decided to advertise the entire process afresh.

“We are going to re-advertise these positions within two weeks and in the first phase we will make appointments on four to six chairs instead of 14,” said the ministry’s Joint Education Adviser Rafiq Tahir.

He said in the first phase appointments would be made in important countries.

Education ministry says it will fill only six of the 14 vacant chairs abroad

Sources said because of budgetary constraints the ministry had decided to reduce the foreign chairs. Last year when the selection was finalised, there was a budget of around Rs50 million which was recently reduced by the federal government to Rs15 million.

The process to select candidates for the positions faced delay for the last around a decade. Pakistan has chairs in 14 foreign universities, including Germany, Turkey and China, which have been vacant for six to 10 years.

The chairs were set up on reciprocal basis and their holders used to deliver lectures aimed at promoting Urdu and the culture and history of Pakistan.

Earlier, the Cabinet Division used to deal with the issue but last year the function was given to the ministry of education.

A senior faculty member of Quaid-i-Azam University said chairs at international universities were a tool to build the country’s image.

“These chairs play an important role in promoting Pakistan’s culture and image. The appointees are academic ambassadors but unfortunately our bureaucrats are not taking this important issue seriously.”

He said India had almost 300 chairs in world’s top university where its scholars were playing an important role to promote their country’s interest.

A Pakistani scholar, who was shortlisted by the committee last year, said after a number of meetings he was selected but so far the education ministry has failed to complete the process.

“Now, we are being told that the process is going to be re-advertised which is unfortunate and a joke with scholars,” he said.

Last year, 28 scholars, two each against one post, were finalised by the committee. He said instead of reducing the number of chairs, the government should appoint more scholars to promote the country’s soft image in the world.

",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: Nearly a month after it was formed, the commission to review Islamabad’s master plan has yet to start working, raising the question of whether it will be able to complete its task within the stipulated six months.

The 12-member commission was formed on Dec 20 last year, but sources said an introductory meeting has not been convinced so far.

A source in the Capital Development Authority, who asked not to be named, said nearly a month – 25 days – has passed, but an initial meeting of the commission has not been called.

According to a notification issued by the Ministry of Interior on Dec 28, the chairman of the CDA will act as the convenor of the commission until someone from the private sector is appointment CDA chairman.

The current CDA chairman, Afzal Latif, is on leave for four months, and Islamabad Chief Commissioner Amer Ali Ahmed has been given additional charge of the office chairman in his absence.

Mr Ahmed was appointed on Thursday but has yet to take charge because his new assignment has not been notified.

MNA Ali Awan, adviser to the prime minister on CDA affairs, told Dawn he would look into the issue.

“The revision of Islamabad’s master plan is highly imported as this work was not carried out in the past. We will check why the first meeting has not even been called yet,” he said.

The original developers the capital’s master plan had recommended revising the plan every 20 years, but successive governments never made any comprehensive revisions. Instead, a number of selective amendments were made from time to time, mostly to benefit specific people.

The lack of revisions has resulted in poor planning and the proliferation of illegal construction.

The commission consists of experts tasked with revising the master plan for the next 20 years – from 2020 to 2040. It will also give its perspective on the regularisation of illegal construction in the capital.

The commission’s terms of reference (ToR) state that it will keep in mind the increased participation of the private sector in health and education when recommending how to resolve this issue.

There are currently more than 300 private schools operating in the city’s residential sectors, along with a large number of healthcare facilities, in violation of CDA by-laws.

The commission will also make proposals for short, medium and long-term development and may amend its ToRs with the government’s approval.

On Sunday, the Islamabad Guest House Association also demanded the government look into the guesthouse issue. The association’s secretary general, Dr Osman Qazi Khan, said that the commission should look into bread and breakfasts in designated areas.

",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Khan Afridi on Sunday denied that he was friends with an alleged cocaine dealer.

According to claims circulating on social media, the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) arrested a man from an upscale part of the capital and recovered a large quantity of cocaine from his possession.

It has been claimed that the man supplied cocaine to parties in the capital and was a close friend of the state minister.

A photograph has also been circulated on social media allegedly showing the man standing beside Mr Afridi.

Mr Afridi, however, stated in a video that “criminal-minded people” had uploaded photos with him online and were “giving the impression that they are my friends.”

He said as a political worker, he cannot stop anyone from taking photos standing beside him.

He said he had launched an anti-drugs campaign with the support of the prime minister.

“I am raising awareness against drugs on roads, on buses and in mosques. I have nothing to do with those who are seen in the pictures with me. I assume that the person took the pictures during the anti-drugs campaign. My and Imran Khan’s vision is to make the country drug-free,” he said.

Mr Afridi claimed people were trying to defame him because he was campaigning against drugs.

When contacted, ANF Director Headquarters Riaz Soomro told Dawn: “We are still in the process of investigation, and we are not in a position to confirm or deny whether he had a link to the minister.”

He said it would be “inappropriate” at this stage to link the suspect to the minister.

This is not the first time Mr Afridi has been linked to someone held for possessing drugs.

On Jan 7, after a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior, Mr Afridi said before the press that action would be taken against anyone caught with drugs regardless of their kinship.

Mr Afridi was then asked if he was related to Talal Nadir Afridi, who was arrested in Attock on Dec 11 for drug possession. The minister said: “Whoever he is, action will be taken against him in accordance with the law.”

He went on to say he had an extended family and his father had married thrice.

Nadir Afridi was arrested along with three others for possession of 507 grams of hashish.

The address he gave to the police was House No 3 in the Minister’s Enclave, and he stated his father’s name as Farrukh Jamal Afridi.

PML-N lawmaker Hina Pervaiz Butt had submitted a resolution in the Punjab Assembly after the incident to condemn the recovery of drugs from the state minister’s relative.

Meanwhile, in a statement, the Islamabad police claimed that 12 people were arrested for possession of liquor and drugs.

The Margalla police arrested someone allegedly involved in supply of drugs to educational institutions and recovered one kilogram hashish from him while the Secretariat police arrested two people and recovered 1.6kg hashish from them.

The Banigala police recovered 10 litres of liquor from an individual, and Noon police recovered 510gm of hashish from two people.

Khanna, Sihala, Koral and Golra police also recovered drugs and liquor from various suspects.

130,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457397/pti-backtracks-on-promise-not-to-spend-funds-through-mpas,"PTI backtracks on promise not to spend funds through MPAs
",2019-01-14,"RAWALPINDI: Backtracking from its previous claim of not utilising development funds through lawmakers, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Punjab government is all set to allocate Rs100 million to each of its MPAs.

In this regard, the government has already collected development proposals from the ruling party MPAs.

In the past, the PTI criticised the PML-N for utilising development funds through its parliamentarians. But after coming to power in Punjab, the party sought development proposals from its members of the provincial assembly.

A senior leader of the party told Dawn that the MPAs submitted their development proposals to the government last month but due to the financial crisis the funds were yet to be released.

“PTI’s parliamentary meeting is scheduled to be held in Lahore on Monday to discuss issues pertaining to the ruling party members in their respective districts. The MPAs will ask the provincial government to start development works.”

Punjab govt collects proposals from ruling party lawmakers to carry out development works worth Rs100m each

He said the ruling party members had also decided to raise the issue of bureaucracy as senior officials of the district administrations were not cooperating with them to resolve problems of the citizens.

He said the MPAs also wanted to launch new projects in their areas, especially in those union councils which were neglected during the tenure of the PML-N government.

He said the party also wanted to change the local government system in the province as at present the PML-N has a majority in all the municipal corporations and district councils. Any changes to the local government law could only be made through the provincial assembly but the PTI does not have the required majority in the house.

In this situation, he added, the provincial government had allocated Rs100 million for each ruling party MPA and asked them to submit their development proposals.

“We have submitted the development proposals to the Punjab government which would release the funds soon,” Chaudhry Adnan, PTI MPA from Rawalpindi city, told Dawn.

He said there was a dire need to launch new projects in many areas as the previous government remained busy in executing projects to make commissions.

“The shortage of water and other issues were ignored in the past and being elected representatives of the people it is our duty to inform the government about it,” he said.

The MPA said the PTI lawmakers had presented their proposals to the government which would spend funds on the sectors as pointed out by the MPAs.

When contacted, MPA Umer Tanveer of the PTI said the development funds would be spent by the government and the role of the ruling party MPAs was only to identify problems of the residents.

“The provincial government allocated Rs100 million for each constituency and in this regard we will give a presentation in the parliamentary meeting on Jan 14,” he said.

The government would also resolve problems of the citizens in the cantonment areas as the proposals included water supply schemes.

On the other hand, a senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the previous PML-N government in Punjab made a political move before the general elections by preparing the development plan in 2018 and launching many projects.

“More than 50pc work on the projects had been completed on these development schemes worth over Rs3 billion and the provincial government would not take the risk of stopping work on them. These projects have to be completed before launching new schemes.”

The official said the government was facing problems to start new schemes before completing the ongoing ones.

“It is the basic reason behind the delay in the release of funds for the new projects. But the MPAs are hopeful to arrange funds for development schemes in their areas,” he said.

",2019-01-14,"LAHORE: PPP Information Secretary Dr Nafisa Shah says new disclosures are being made about the PTI daily as its leadership is involved in corruption.

Speaking at a press conference along with Munawwar Anjum and Hassan Murtaza here on Sunday, she recalled that the PTI election manifesto was anti-corruption and one Pakistan for all. But, after coming into power, it adopted double standards on corruption, she said.

She said prime minister’s sister Aleema Khan who is caretaker of Shaukat Khanum Hospital’s donations, had been found to be owning $450 million property in New Jersey, US declared in the amnesty scheme in 2017. She asked whether the demand by opposition for investigation of the affair was just or not.

Likewise, she said, financial affairs and contracts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government during the last five years as well as fake accounts of the PTI funds must also be probed.

The PPP leader said Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Afridi talked of use of drugs by Islamabad college girls but the fact is that his own nephew had been caught smuggling drugs and Mr Afridi should decide his punishment on his own.

She told a questioner that the PPP would move every forum including courts against Aleema Khan, Imran Khan, Jahangir Tareen, Aleem Khan and others.

She lamented that names of her party leaders were placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) on the report of a so-called JIT and that despite the Supreme Court orders the same were not being removed from the list. Whereas, she pointed out, the name of Liaquat Jatoi was removed from the list despite investigation.

Ms Shah chided the finance minister for changing stance on national economy. She said Asad Umar took third U-turn in six months as he said Islamabad was not going to the IMF but was giving a second budget. She asked which government would give a second budget in six months.

Responding to a question, she said Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had talked of march on Islamabad on the basis of issues unlike Imran Khan’s attack on parliament. “We are in contact with the masses. With the support of the masses we’ll march on Islamabad when the conditions will become intolerable.”

Answering another question, she said the PPP had taken a principled stance against military courts.

According to park officials, the 40-year-old rhino has been ‘sick’ for the last few days and was found dead in the artificial lake in the enclave where she lived with the male rhino. Her body was retrieved from the lake after hectic efforts, the officials added.

The pair of rhinos was gifted to Pakistan by Nepal in 1982. On the orders of the then Punjab governor Gen Ghulam Jillani, the pair was housed at the National Park, Lal Sohanra.

The then park administrator late Maj Syed Manzoor Hussain Shah got built a trench-cum-lake for the pair where they used to bath and relax for hours to the joy of those visiting the park, especially the children.

As per park sources, the female rhino was pregnant and had a miscarriage a few days back and might have died because of excessive bleeding that had weakened her.

They said the female rhino had a stillbirth last year.

Park Conservator Javed Gill, who is also the administrator of the facility, told Dawn that a rhino’s average lifespan was 60-70 years and the female could complete around half of it in captivity.

He said a postmortem examination of the dead beast had been ordered to determine the cause of death.

",2019-01-14,"LAHORE: Political parties are now being run through a remote-control mechanism as one cannot talk against the security establishment even in internal discourse, says the Awami National Party leader Afrasiab Khattak.

He was speaking on ‘Progressive Politics in Pakistan’ at ThinkFest here on Sunday.

Terming the prevailing judicial activism a ‘judicial martial law’, he alleged that the Supreme Court chief justice was usurping the executive’s authority.

He called for signing of a document by all political parties like the Charter of Democracy (CoD) to regain the space lost to undemocratic forces. He also talked of lack of democracy within the parties and urged their leaders to rectify the situation to be on a high moral ground in the struggle against undemocratic forces.

Awami Workers’ Party’s Tooba Syed held the “catharsis” of activists through social media responsible for their reluctance to join actual political movements.

The Friday Times editor Aima Khosa didn’t see any progressive movement in the country for the time being, blaming it on a lack of tradition and contemporary difficult conditions. She said the activists needed cadre organisation and political training for becoming part of such organizations.

Akbar S Zaidi, who conducted the session, didn’t agree with Ms Khosa and said in fact difficult conditions enhanced the role and even gave birth to such movements and organisations.

Responding to queries from the audience, Mr Khattak admitted political parties suffered because of not embracing new classes like youth and the urban middle class, while these could not adjust themselves to the changes in political discourse and issues that emerged in the post-Zia period.

In the session on ‘Growth, IMF and Pakistan Economy’, former finance minister Salman Shah called for improving agriculture productivity through better water management, diverting Chinese investment, special economic zones, renegotiating free trade agreement with China to check its tilt towards Beijing, introducing public-private partnership concept in infrastructure development.

Miftah Ismael, who was financial advisor during PML-N government, downplayed the fears of Pakistan being put on black list by the FATF saying the country had earlier been on the list (without any serious harm) in 2008-09.

He said Islamabad could not substitute imports with exports for want of costly raw material used in many industries. Talking of lack of foreign visitors, he said at Dhaka more foreign airliners landed than Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore combined.

Ex-finance minister Hafeez Pasha advised the rulers not to (negatively) touch the National Finance Commission award issues and called for reducing the size of bureaucratic setup in Islamabad.

",2019-01-14,"SUKKUR: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that nobody can stop him from going abroad for official visits or pilgrimage.

“Can anyone stop me if I have to perform Haj or Umra; or ziaraat in Iraq?” he asked.

The chief minister was speaking to the media after attending the Valima ceremony of former MPA Syed Jawed Ali Shah’s son here on Sunday.

He said he had undertaken just a couple of private foreign tours so far since becoming the chief minister. “By the way, I don’t intend to go abroad in near future,” he added.

Mr Shah said he was not worried about placement of his name on the exit control list (ECL).

Apparently referring to Local Govt Minister Saeed Ghani’s recent statement regarding a tit-for-tat action over foreign travel ban on the CM and certain other PPP leaders, Mr Shah said there would be no disruption in the prime minister’s or any federal minister’s visit to Sindh on the part of the provincial government.

“Imran Khan is the Prime Minister of the country; he is free to go anywhere he wants to go,” the CM said.

Commenting on alleged moves to dislodge his government, Mr Shah said the Sindh government would stay until it enjoyed support of the masses and PPP leadership. He said no conspiracy against his government would succeed. “Those sitting in Islamabad ought to tell me which of his or his government’s act had actually angered them,” he added.

In reply to a question, he said it was the media that keenly projected the unparliamentary language uttered guests at various programmes and other people. “If the media stops this practice, the trend will certainly die down,” he argued.

Answering a question about future of military courts, the chief minister said that his party had already conveyed its stance on the subject to the authorities concerned.

136,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457328/top-gda-leaders-meet-ahead-of-pms-visit-to-ghotki,"Top GDA leaders meet ahead of PM’s visit to Ghotki
",2019-01-14,"SUKKUR: The Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), currently engaged in political manoeuvring amid persisting uncertainty about future of the Sindh government, held a crucial meeting on Sunday at Gohar Palace in Khangarh, Ghotki district, ahead of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Jan 27 visit to Sindh.

The meeting was presided over by GDA chief Pir Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi (Pir Sahib Pagara) and attended by other top alliance leaders including Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi, Ayaz Latif Palijo, Dr Hasnain Mirza, Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim, Irfanullah Marwat, Ghulam Murtaza Jatoi, Ghous Bakhsh Khan Mahar and the host, MPA Sardar Ali Gohar Khan Mahar.

Speaking to the media after the meeting, both Sardar Mahar and GDA secretary general Ayaz Palijo said that a “change” in Sindh through constitutional means was discussed. They said the alliance would continue to support Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf as its ally at the Centre as there was a consensus among leaderships of both entities, as well as all other stakeholders of the state, on rooting out corruption from the country.

‘Constitutional change’ in Sindh discussed, required support within assembly claimed

Regarding GDA’s efforts to dislodge Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) from power corridors in Sindh, Mr Palijo argued that the PPP government had destroyed the agriculture sector in the province over the decade-long rule over it, besides plaguing all departments with corruption.

“They have devastated growers in Sindh,” he said, adding that the province was not getting its due share in the Indus water while Wapda and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) remained indifferent to the issue.

Mr Palijo categorically stated that the GDA would not support any unconstitutional move aimed about a change of government in Sindh. He said GDA would play a vital role in bringing about such a change through constitutional moves. “There are dozens of members of the Sindh Assembly in contact with Pir Pagara and Sardar Ali Gohar Khan Mahar who are willing to support such a move,” he said.

He said GDA had already started mobilising public support from Ghotki district and similar efforts would be made in all other districts very soon. He said GDA’s aim was to make the country corruption-free.

Any strategy in this regard, if chalked out, would certainly be a joint effort of the GDA and PTI, he said.

Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi told the media said there would be an in-house change in the Sindh Assembly. It would not come through unconstitutional means, he said, adding that GDA would not be part of any unconstitutional change.

Referring to PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s warning to the PTI government over a possible “invasion of Islamabad” by oppressed people of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pir Rashdi said: “The Zardari party is not strong enough to invade even Ghotki let alone Islamabad ... the party has done massive corruption in Sindh ... they have to face accountability first”

Commenting on Prime Minister’s scheduled visit to Ghotki, MPA Ali Gohar Mahar said that he would seek a big package for Sindh from the Centre which should include establishment of a university in Ghotki.

He said many areas of the district were without gas though it was the first area of Sindh where natural gas was discovered in 1993 and first well of the province was sunk here. No other benefits were being given to Ghotki against the gas deposits and supplies.

Former chief minister Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim said that the prime minister was coming to Sindh to know about the issues confronting Sindh. He said Mr Khan would be apprised of all pressing issues. He said there were certain issues supposed to be addressed by the provincial government but it was shifting all responsibilities to the federal government.

He hinted that a change in Sindh was imminent “once the accountability process in the province is completed”.

After the meeting, Pir Pagara left for the Tar Ghar bungalow — the residence of Sardar Ali Gohar Mahar in Sardar Garh — for an overnight stay.

",2019-01-14,"KARACHI: The chief provincial law officer said on Saturday that the Supreme Court-mandated commission on water and sanitation in Sindh needed to continue till its objectives were completely accomplished.

When the commission, which is set to complete its tenure on Jan 15, resumed its sitting, Advocate General, Sindh, Salman Talibuddin made a statement on the behalf of the provincial government.

He appreciated the working of the commission and said that its tenure should be extended since many ongoing schemes would be better monitored by the commission while a number of other schemes were in a formative stage.

The AG also tendered an apology regarding the comments of an additional advocate general made about the commission last week before the Supreme Court when its final report was submitted in the apex court.

He further said that when the same matter would be taken up for hearing by the apex court on Monday, the law officer of Sindh will record “no objection” to the commission’s final report.

Shahab Usto, who had petitioned the apex court regarding water and sanitation issues in Sindh, also endorsed the proposal of the advocate general regarding continuation of the commission.

However, the commission, headed by retried Justice Amir Hani Muslim, said that it was the sole domain of the Supreme Court to consider such a request independently.

Justice Muslim had already requested the apex court that he was stepping down upon the completion of his tenure on Jan 15 due to personal reasons and the Supreme Court had also allowed it.

",2019-01-14,"KARACHI: A man, who had filed a petition in court for the recovery of his estranged ‘wife’ and three daughters, allegedly gunned down the 37-year-old man with whom his wife and the children were living in a flat in a New Town locality on Sunday in front of policemen, officials said.

They added that the police with the petitioner had gone to the flat to arrest the man on a court order to present the petitioner’s wife and his three daughters in court on the next hearing of the case.

“An incident of firing took place within the remit of the New Town police station when the additional SHO Darakhshan went with applicant Sohail Mughal on a court order to arrest Munawar Ali,” said Karachi East SSP Azfar Mahesar.

Gulshan SP Tahir Noorani told media that Sohail Mughal had filed an abduction case of his family against Munawar Ali, which was quashed by the court.

However, the court directed the Darakshan police on Dec 31, 2018 on a petition of the suspect to recover the suspect’s three daughters and wife and present them in court on Jan 17, East SSP Azfar Mahesar said.

The petitioner was present during the last hearing of the case and stated that the “police authorities have not produced the ladies”.

He had urged the court to issue an ‘appropriate action’ against the respondents.

The New Town police officer in whose jurisdiction the incident took place told Dawn that when petitioner Sohail Mughal with the additional SHO of Darakhshan arrived at the apartment in Sharafabad, Munawar Ali was already present at the gate of the multi-storey building.

However, before the police could arrest him, Mughal, who had hidden a 9mm pistol in his shalwar, took out the gun and opened fire on Munawar.

He fired four shots as a result of which Munawar sustained two bullet wounds and was taken by the additional SHO to the Liaquat National Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

Later, the body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.

Dr Seemin Jamali, executive director of the hospital, said that Munawar had received two bullet wounds on his chest and abdomen.

The police arrested Sohail Mughal with the pistol and collected spent bullet casings from the crime scene.

The New Town police officer said that neighbours told the police that the suspect’s wife had taken ‘divorce’ from him and was living with Munawar Ali with her three daughters.

The police detained the additional SHO of Darakhshan with other policemen on charges of criminal negligence.

DIG East Amir Farooqi said a murder case would be registered against Sohail Mughal and another case pertaining to criminal negligence against the Darakhshan policemen.

",2019-01-14,"KARACHI: Police resorted to baton-charge in an attempt to maintain order at the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, where thousands of young jobless persons, who came from all over Sindh, congregated on Sunday for walk-in interviews the hospital had announced for 300 lower-grade jobs.

The hospital administration said more than 12,000 people had arrived for interviews. The police, however, offered a figure of around 30,000.

It was beyond expectations for the hospital administration, yet the happenings reflected how grave the issue of unemployment was.

While witnesses said police resorted to baton-charge, a senior police officer denied that the police took such an action against the people gathered there.

The witnesses said the candidates had begun arriving outside the hospital since the early hours of Sunday morning. Many of them had graduate degrees, yet they wanted the jobs because of unemployment.

The long queues soon turned into unruly gatherings before all that merged into a mob that was restless and raucous, yet they restrained themselves from becoming violent.

Some of the candidates came for walk-in interviews were seen climbing the barricades formed by the hospital administration and the local police. A number of them clambered to the rooftop.

Police’s decision to adopt mild tactics saved the day and stemmed the situation from going even graver and, fortunately, the general anguish remained suppressed and failed to create stampede.

The situation, however, warranted for further fortification and the paramilitary Rangers were called in.

The hospital had established 13 places — eight for men, four for women and one for the disabled persons — to take interviews of candidates.

Witnesses said although the counters for men, women and disabled persons were safely distant from each other outside the outpatient department of the hospital, yet, the hullaballoo at the men’s counters created concern on other areas.

“There were dozens of disabled persons and some of them could not get the tokens for interviews because of the chaos and they returned,” said a witness.

Another said the situation at the women’s counters remained normal where it was ensured — both by the candidates and the administration — to maintain calm.

SSP-City Muquddus Haider told Dawn that the police had advised the hospital administration that they should conduct interviews of the candidates in phases on different days to avoid a stampede-like situation and ensure the order but their advice was ostensibly not entertained by the authorities at the health facility.

The officer said people had arrived from across Sindh along with their relatives.

He also denied reports that the police resorted to baton-charge.

Another officer, Eidgah SHO Nadeem Haider said several thousand people had gathered outside the hospital for interviews.

The medical superintendent of the hospital said they had offered 300 jobs for lower grades for which they had called direct interviews.

“Rest assured,” said hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Sabir Memon, “everyone who has come here will be interviewed; no matter, how much time it takes. We are here to manage all this.”

A senior health official said: “Everything is normal now. The recruitment is being made in accordance with the set SOPs [standard operating procedures].”

",2019-01-14,"KARACHI: The trial pertaining to extrajudicial killing of aspiring Waziristan model Naqeeb Ullah Mehsud and three others in an staged encounter has yet to formally begin, as the main suspect, former SSP Rao Anwar, and his 25 subordinates have not been indicted one year after the incident, it emerged on Sunday.

SSP Rao Anwar with his subordinates has been booked for killing Naqeeb and three others after dubbing them ‘Taliban militants’ in a ‘fake’ shoot-out on Jan 13, 2018.

The Anti-Terrorism Court No 2 had granted bail to Rao in the two cases pertaining to the kidnapping and murder as well as registering fake criminal cases against the victims in July last.

An antiterrorism court is set to announce order on bail pleas of 10 policemen today

The killing of the young Mehsud had sparked widespread protests by the civil society and Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar took suo motu notice of the killings.

After eluding law enforcers for two months and upon being offered opportunities by the CJP to surrender, the former SSP had finally appeared before the Supreme Court and was subsequently arrested in Islamabad.

Instead of detaining him in the Karachi central prison, jail authorities had shifted him to a house due to alleged security concerns, declaring it a sub-jail in the Malir Cantonment area.

Four other suspects — former DSP Qamar, Muhammad Yaseen, Supurd Hussain and Khizar Hayat — have also been granted bail.

After slain model’s father Khan Muhammad Mehsud, who is the complainant in the main case, showed no confidence in the ATC-II, the Sindh High Court had transferred the cases to the ATC-III on Nov 5.

“The formal trial has not taken off so far because none of the suspects has been indicted by the trial court in the cases,” Advocate Salahuddin Panhwar, the counsel for the complainant Mehsud, had told Dawn after attending the last hearing on Jan 6.

On the last hearing, the ATC-III had reserved its order on applications filed by 10 police officials, who remained absconding for as many months and then approached the court seeking pre-arrest bail to avoid their arrest in the cases.

“The court will announce its verdict on their bail pleas on Jan 14 [today],” judicial staff told Dawn, adding that the hearing in the main case was fixed for Jan 30.

Around six suspended police officials — Sub-Inspector Sheikh Mohammad Shoaib alias Shoaib Shooter, SI Gada Hussain, SI Amanullah Marwat, Head Constable Shafqat Hussain, Constables Mohsin Abbas, Raja Shamim, Rana Riaz — are still absconding in the case.

Police probe finds Rao Anwar, others guilty

On May 2, 2018 the trial court had accepted a supplementary investigation report submitted by investigating officer SSP Dr Rizwan Ahmed, who had charge-sheeted all the suspended policemen in the cases.

The supplementary charge sheet that mentioned that the forensic reports of the weapons, a technical analysis of the call detail records (CDR), TV interviews of Rao Anwar and circumstantial evidence suggested the involvement of Rao Anwar and his team members in the extrajudicial killing and dubbing the victims as terrorists.

There was no criminal record of the victims against whom the suspects had highlighted ‘fake stories in the media’ to hush up the extrajudicial killings, the supplementary charge sheet said, alleging that during the investigation the nominated policemen were also found involved in destroying evidence, misusing their official authority in an attempt to cover up their other unlawful acts.

It further mentioned that in the light of all the evidence and statements of the witnesses, the arrested suspects, including Rao Anwar, were involved in kidnapping for ransom, murder and destruction of the evidence.

It had stated that the CDR showed the presence of Rao Anwar at the crime scene between 2.55am and 3.21am, adding that his presence was also recorded near the New Sabzi Mandi on Superhighway on Jan 4, 5, 8, 9 and 13.

The CDR analysis further revealed that PC Feroze, former SHO Marwat and ASI Hussain were present at the crime scene together on Jan 12, 2018 while the presence of SI Anwar, ASI Hussain, ASI Khair Mohammad and Raja Shamim was also recorded on Jan 13 last year.

It showed that PC Feroze and ASI Hussain contacted each other through mobile phones 18 times on the day of the incident and a day before it while PC Feroze also changed his mobile SIM cards and mobile phones several times after the incident.

“The digital evidence show the important role of the suspects in planning and execution of the fake encounter, while it also suggest their involvement in failure to report the crime and abetting the police party in the fake encounter,” it stated.

The CDR analysis further showed that mobile phones of Mohsin Abbas and Raja Riaz were switched off at the time of the encounter and former DSP Qamar Ahmed had constantly been in contact with the police involved in the fake encounter.

It further mentioned that former ASI Allahyar, former HC Mohammad Iqbal, former constables Arshad Ali, Ghulam Nazik, Shafiq Ahmed and Abdul Wali were found involved in kidnapping Naqeeb and his friends from the Sher Agha hotel and taking them to the Abbas Town police post and trying to cover up the whole episode, which was an offence under the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

It added that former constables Abbas and Imran Kazmi were found involved in the kidnapping, torture and demanding ransom for the victims’ release.

It said former ASI Akbar Mallah’s role in the fake encounter was determined while the former DSP was found involved in making entries of the fake encounter, tampering with the evidence and facilitating the police party involved in fake encounter.

The supplementary charge sheet revealed that there was no criminal record of the victims against whom the suspects had highlighted fake stories in the media to hush up the extrajudicial killings. The police were also found involved in destroying the evidence, misusing their official authority in an attempt to cover up their other unlawful acts.

The supplementary charge sheet mentioned that in the light of all the evidence and statements of the witnesses, the arrested suspects, including Rao Anwar, were involved in kidnapping for ransom, murder and destroying the evidence.

Court yet to take up eyewitness’s affidavit

The trial court has yet to consider a personal affidavit filed by HC Shahzada Jahangir in which he deviated from his initial statement given to the police against Rao Anwar and his subordinates regarding their involvement in the extrajudicial killing.

In the affidavit, he said that he was not present at the place of the incident on January 13, 2018.

Deviating from his earlier statement, Jahangir stated that after seven or eight days of his arrest he was threatened and forced to give a statement. He had alleged that he was coerced to give the statement, which was not based on facts and the police had tortured him.

Earlier, he had told the IO that he was a close aide of then Shah Latif Town SHO Marwat, who on Jan 13 called him at the place of incident and upon arriving there he found the SHO and other police officials present there while the four detained men were also in their custody.

In the meantime, Rao Anwar, DSP Qamar, then SHO Shaikh and other police officials also arrived there and then Marwat, Shoaib and others took the detained men to an abandoned poultry farm, he said, adding that they heard gunshots and thereafter Marwat and other police officials came out of the poultry farm and asked him to do the paperwork.

He said that he found the bodies of the detained men in the building.

141,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457310/why-do-ethnicities-tend-to-gravitate-towards-certain-professions,"Why do ethnicities tend to gravitate towards certain professions?
",2019-01-14,"PAKISTAN’S labour market segmentation shows the concentration of ethnicities along occupational lines. The ethnic composition in several professions, however, is visibly changing. For policymakers this insight can be helpful for developing effective interventions to better harness the country’s most valuable asset: its human capital.

Several economic, political and social factors push ethnic groups towards specific occupations. Generally, it appears that the choice of occupation is a cumulative function of an individual’s human and social capital and position on the social scale.

Currently the national labour database does not shed light on this dimension. The Labour Force Survey 2017-18 launched and posted on the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) last week did not reveal the ethnic composition of the labour force in Pakistan.

Shaista Sohail, secretary PBS, who holds an additional charge of chief statistician, joined the organisation last month. She acknowledged weaknesses in the current database of the country.

“We wish to make data truly reflective of the reality by improving its efficacy. The organisation is in the process of transformation. Instead of limiting change to administrative steps we wish to invite International Labour Organisation experts and representatives of civil society, to bring about necessary changes in the methodology and the framework of data collection and processing,” she told Dawn over phone from Islamabad.

‘For a better understanding of the quiet societal transformation, it would also be relevant to probe the reasons for the domination of certain ethnicities in specific occupations. The starting point, however, is to collect data’

“I believe that the participation rate of women is under-reported as we can see an increasing number of ladies serving in the retail and fast food chains, etc. It is also absolutely necessary to improve the quality of agriculture data to include information on organic farming in Pakistan,” she said.

“We are considering inducting young people and trained analysts to make this organisation dynamic so that it may better serve its purpose and assist policymakers and researchers,” Ms Sohail concluded.

In Pakistan, quite a few preconceived perceptions regarding professions based on ethnicity abound. These include: martial services are supposed to be mostly dominated by people from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; transporters, cobblers, unskilled construction workers are apparently more often Pakhtuns.

Other popular perceptions include: pharmacists and sweatmeat merchants are supposed to be dominated by Sindhis, low-grade civil servants, semi-skilled workers and khepias (agents who make foreign visits for the informal sale-purchase of goods) are thought to be disproportionately Urdu speaking, stockbrokers and gold merchants are supposed to be mostly Memons, while most carpenters and nurses are conceived to be Punjabis.

Shaukat Khattak, a senior officer informed that national labour statistics are survey based. “PBS carries out an extensive exercise to collect labour data. In all, 42,000 households are surveyed in four provinces and 6,000 are surveyed in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The survey form currently does not include a question on ethnicity of respondents though we do ask about the profession,” he commented.

The Labour Survey 2017-18 makes very broad 22 occupational classifications but does not go beyond gender and rural-urban dimensions. Retail and mechanics are clubbed together. Transport and storage is one category. Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply is another classification.

According to the current data 38.4 per cent of labour is absorbed in agriculture, forestry and fishing, 16.5pc in manufacturing, 14pc in wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles account for 14.9pc, transport and storage for 5.6pc and public administration, defence and compulsory social security for 2.4pc and other services activities for 2.1pc. Participation in all other categories is less than 1pc.

Some occupations in Pakistan may still have specific ethnicities dominating them but this trend has weakened with urbanisation and the influx of people of other nationalities in every profession, it is observed.

“For a better understanding of the quiet societal transformation it would also be relevant to probe the reasons for domination of certain ethnicities in specific occupations. The starting point, however, is to collect data that sheds some light on this dimension of the labour market.

“This information may help carve out strategies of cross-ethnic harmony based on policies insuring equal opportunity for all as the country learned the hard way the pitfalls of ethnic discrimination when the East-wing seceded,” commented an analyst.

“It is only when people are treated by the ruling clique as an asset and not a liability that they start caring to dissect data for evidence-based planning to improve governance quality, ensure equitable sharing and equal opportunity. Currently, disparities are rampant in Pakistan. It is hoped that a stable democratic government will prove to be more caring,” he added.

142,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457312/sindh-should-take-a-leaf-from-punjabs-book-to-fight-drought,"Sindh should take a leaf from Punjab’s book to fight drought
",2019-01-14,"The year began in Tharparkar — Pakistan’s biggest arid region with large human and livestock populations — with inhabitants facing drought yet again.

Droughts and famines are a regular feature of life in Tharparkar. Barring a few pockets that received rainfall in 2017, the rest of the area has not been getting any rain for the last four years. Locals believe droughts usually come to an end with enough rainfall that enables the farming community to grow seasonal crops and produce sufficient fodder for livestock, which is their prime asset.

Thar’s agro-pastoral life revolves around water and fodder. Provincial and federal governments tend to address the issues faced by the local population using a relief-based approach. A sustainable, institutional oversight has so far eluded this least developed region where people endure harsh conditions regularly. This is despite the fact that Thar is blessed with a fascinating landscape that mesmerises tourists after every monsoon rainfall.

Climate change has also affected the rainfall cycle in Thar, which receives the annual drizzle around August-September. But the May-July period is considered ideal for the sowing of crops as farmers hope to have better per-acre yields in the seasonal crops like bajra. Late sowing in September leads to lower yields.

No permanent arrangement to ensure fodder availability exists in Thar, although livestock plays a central role in sustaining economic life in the area

Every drought triggers migration among communities. This migration is in addition to the seasonal ones that take place at the time of cotton-picking or sugar cane and wheat harvesting. Groundwater levels drop considerably in the absence of rainfall. Livestock, which is the community’s only source of livelihood, forces them to leave their area in search of fodder and water in canal command areas.

No permanent arrangement for fodder availability, like fodder banks, exists in Tharparkar during the drought. This is despite the fact that livestock plays a central role in sustaining economic life in the area. It provides them with milk and butter, but animals suffer a loss of immunity during every drought. As a result, milk production drops considerably, causing undernourishment especially among expecting mothers. This makes the survival of malnourished newborns difficult.

Based on the projected animal population number and the human population of 1.6 million as per the latest census, one individual maintains around four animals in Tharparkar. Immunity loss necessitates preventive vaccination among animals, but its coverage is hardly 20pc in Sindh for want of resources, an official admitted.

The livestock sector has a share of 58.92pc within the country’s agriculture sector, which contributed 18.9pc to GDP as per the 2017-18 Economic Survey of Pakistan. The estimated livestock population in 2017 was 41.68m in Sindh. About 6m of them were in Tharparkar, according to Sindh’s livestock department. It makes Thar the district with the highest livestock population.

“We get hardly 25pc vaccination coverage in Sindh and the same goes for Thar,” said a senior livestock department officer. “But there has luckily been no major disaster as the livestock department has hired additional manpower and resources from other districts for vaccination. That’s why the department didn’t draw the ire of the chief justice of Pakistan,” he added.

Changing climatic conditions are causing multiple challenges for Tharparkar, which calls for a paradigm shift at the policy level. The Sindh government needs to look beyond hurried livestock vaccination, wheat distribution and reverse osmosis plants. An increase in livestock’s budgetary allocations — currently Rs1.3bn — is badly needed.

The Punjab government’s initiatives in the arid region of Cholistan offer a cue. As opposed to Thar, Cholistan seems relatively better managed. This is why it has not had any disaster of the kind that Thar has witnessed. The Cholistan area, consisting of 29,000 square kilometres, is spread over Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur and Rahimyar Khan. The Punjab government has also established the Cholistan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences in Bahawalpur, which is affiliated with Glasgow University.

Cholistan, however, had a smaller estimated human population of roughly 220,000 in 2017 along with 1.6m heads of livestock. The Punjab government’s Cholistan Development Authority (CDA) deals with this area exclusively. Within the provincial livestock department, a directorate looks after the affairs of Cholistan.

Dr Ali Raza Abbasi, CDA’s directorate head, considers the drought an opportunity. “We provide livestock farmers with wanda (feed supplement) on a cost-to-cost basis throughout the year at fixed entry/exit points,” he said. He added that ponds are built in the area for human and livestock populations in addition to an old natural waterway that is connected with pumping stations.

Since 2018, he said, his department has been buying camel milk for Rs42 per litre and keeping it in chillers. It is then sold for Rs120 per litre in Lahore. He said that the department also purchased cattle milk in 2010. But the private firms’ intervention jacked up the market price, which benefited farmers. “The animal vaccination coverage in 100pc,” he remarked.

Around 17 chillers (out of 153 in Sindh) were set up in Thar. But those were part of the foreign-funded Sindh Agriculture Growth Project (SAGP). Reportedly, only three of them are functioning. Since a large number of livestock left Thar for want for fodder, milk could not be collected in the rest of the chillers. The provincial livestock department has provided three livestock farmers with solar-powered submersible pumps to lift groundwater and grow fodder on an experimental basis.

India’s Rajasthan and Pakistan’s Thar and Cholistan are part of the same region, said former chairman of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), Dr Mohammad Ashraf. He said reverse osmosis plants are not a solution to Thar’s woes. “Managing these plants is difficult even in urban areas. The Sindh government needs to focus more on rainwater harvesting projects in Thar,” he said.

A draft of the Sindh Drought and Disaster Mitigation Policy 2014 was prepared following the 2014 drought. It proposed that a Thar Development Authority be set up in the area along the lines of CDA. The Sindh Assembly’s relevant committee has okayed the policy, but it still needs the legislature’s nod.

",2019-01-14,"QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani has refuted “rumours of differences” in the ruling Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and said that no one can create a rift in the party which is making efforts for development of the province and prosperity of the people.

According to reports, differences have emerged in the BAP over its candidate for a Senate seat from Balochistan which has fallen vacant after death of Sardar Azam Khan Musakhail.

However, Mr Alyani, who is also president of the BAP, said, “Some elements which are spreading rumours about differences in the party on social media can’t even win union council elections. They are trying to create misunderstanding within the party.”

CM says opponents can’t swallow better performance of his govt

“The BAP is united and making efforts to secure rights of Balochistan and solve the problems being faced by the people of the province,” he said in a statement issued here on Sunday.

The chief minister said, “We contested general elections under the slogan of ‘prosperous Balochistan’ and are trying to implement the manifesto of the party.” However, he added, some people were spreading negative propaganda against the party with rumours that it had weakened.

He criticised previous provincial governments alleging that during their tenures, jobs were sold at high prices and Balochistan remained backward due to their negligence to the issues being faced by the province.

He said that the rulers running the previous governments did not pay attention to the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) that kept Balochistan a poor and deprived province.

Mr Alyani said that his government was making all out efforts to bring a positive and progressive change in the life of the people of Balochistan.

He said that his government would continue making efforts to improve the situation in the province through providing basic facilities to the people and solving their problems.

Referring to the opponents’ criticism on the provincial government’s performance, the CM said those irresponsible politicians could not swallow the performance of the government over the last four months,

“Our government has made record legislation and taken action over major issues the province is facing. Seven meetings of the provincial cabinet have been held so far in which important decisions were taken on the PSDP in the interest of the people of Balochistan,” he said.

Lauding the support of coalition partners, the chief minister said, “They have been supporting us in making decisions for better future of the province.”

",2019-01-14,"SAHIWAL: A farm worker was killed and 16 others were injured in a ‘clash and exchange of fire’ between the administration of Baiel Gunj Military Stud Farm and tenants, commonly called Mazareen, in Pakpattan district on Saturday evening.

The clash reportedly erupted over the removal of a ‘dysfunctional’ power transformer which fed a tube well irrigating the farmland.

Villagers in the nearby farm claimed that heavy firing was heard for 50 minutes. Sources said that 13 tenants and four security personnel of the farm were injured in the clash.

Rescue 1122 sources confirmed that they shifted the injured to the Baiel Ganj Basic Health Unit and the Pakpattan DHQ Hospital.

Pakpattan Health Authority CEO Imtiaz Rana told the media that emergency was declared in the DHQ Hospital. The sources said Mamshad Ahmed, son of Haji Manzoor, succumbed to his wounds sustained in the clash.

As police did not reportedly register the case, some 500 residents and Mazareen from Farid Nagar Colony, adjacent to the farm, marched in protest towards the Pakpattan police chief office.

Carrying the worker’s body, the protesters demanded the registration of an FIR against the culprits.

Later, the protesters assembled outside the deputy commissioner’s office where the sit-in continued for over four hours.

Sources in police confirmed that the DPO office had to call reserve police force to avoid any possible clash around the farm. They said the road connecting Pakpattan with Deepalpur and Kasur had been closed.

The sit-in ended when ­a three-member committee comprising Deputy Com­mis­sioner Ahmed Kamal Maan, DPO Mariya Mah­mood and SP Investigation Syed Abbas Shah met the protest leaders.

Mr Maan told Dawn by phone that the protesters dispersed after an assurance that FIR would be registered under the law.

DPO office spokesperson Asif said the body was taken to the DHQ Hospital for autopsy.

146,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457463/nab-accused-of-harassing-metro-bus-project-contractors,"NAB accused of harassing Metro bus project contractors
",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has been accused of setting an example of “harassment” in the case of the Multan Metro Bus Project (MMBP) as the country’s top of the line contractors involved in the project are on bail to avoid their arrest.

According to the Contractors Association of Pakistan (CAP), NAB has challenged engineering estimates made by the Multan Development Authority (MDA) much before the award of the Rs28 billion MMBP contract. Thus the contractors had nothing to do with preparation of these estimates. The only charge is that the engineering estimates were high and led to a loss of Rs1.7bn to the national exchequer. Meanwhile, over Rs3.2bn dues of the contractors are yet to be paid by the MDA.

NAB claims that it has to recover Rs1.7bn from the contractors and, therefore, the anti-graft watchdog is running after the contractors to arrest them, the CAP says. However, the MDA owes twice this amount to the contractors, it adds.

The opposition believes that NAB’s case is weak and the bureau is just using tactics for arm-twisting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leaders by implicating them in the MMBP case.

The contractors’ association has written a letter to NAB Chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal, complaining that audit objections are being treated as criminal cases.

In the letter, the CAP has asked the NAB chief to ensure a fair and transparent probe into mega development projects and expressed the fear that “harassment will drive away investors”.

The CAP has alleged that despite meeting legal requirements and procedures, a group of contractors engaged in the project is being harassed and victimised.

The MMBP was launched in June 2015 and the bus service was inaugurated by the then chief minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, in Jan 2017.

Six top-ranking national and international firms had taken part in the execution of the MMBP. They completed the project two years ago and almost all of them are presently engaged in other national projects.

A source told Dawn that the heads of six firms, who worked on different segments of the MMBP, had obtained pre-arrest bail from court, but the head of another company, who could not get bail, had been arrested by NAB.

The CAP has assured NAB of its support in the probe into the Metro bus project or any other construction project, but said: “We feel that complex construction issues and disputes between construction companies and the government are being dragged into criminal jurisdiction.

“This appears to be due to lack of understanding and expertise of NAB’s investigation officers with International Federation of Consulting Engineers [FIDIC] conditions, besides other complex technical and contractual matters.”

The letter says that contractual disputes and audit objections need to be segregated from criminal proceedings.

It has said that the construction sector of Pakistan is running businesses worth trillions of rupees, giving employment to millions of people and making huge investments.

“It may also be considered that we are the engines of growth and contribute towards national economy in various ways by paying direct and indirect taxes, generating direct and indirect employment, driving the steel, cement, glass and tiles industries as being major consumers of such products,” the CAP letter says.

The contractors’ association has said: “We are the ones building dams, roads, motorways, houses, schools, universities and hospitals for the nation of international standards and at most economical prices.”

A spokesman for NAB said that four firms involved in the project were ready to return some amount under voluntary return (VR) deals. “There must be something wrong. That is why the contractors are ready to return the money to the government exchequer,” he added.

He said that a reference had been prepared against officials of the Multan Development Authority for “illegal” acquisition of state land for the project.

The NAB spokesman said that the inquiry into the MMBP covered four main dimensions — evaluation of feasibility study and approval of the project; evaluation of bidding process, award of the contract, execution of works, international procurements, payments made to contractors, sub-contractors and vendors; evaluation of land acquisition process; and tracking/trailing of financial transactions into accounts of M/s Yabaite China.

He said that NAB Multan was conducting investigations as per laws and it would send its report to the bureau’s headquarters for scrutiny and review. The report will be presented before the executive board of NAB to decide further course of action.

147,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457465/opposition-set-to-give-tough-time-to-ruling-coalition-in-na,"Opposition set to give tough time to ruling coalition in NA
",2019-01-14,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly is set to go into its seventh session on Monday (today) with Speaker Asad Qaiser still struggling with the formation of the house committees as the opposition parties flexing its muscles to give a tough time to the ruling coalition on a number of issues, including the ongoing energy crisis, alleged one-sided accountability process, the government’s move to present another mini-budget and the recent increase in the prices of medicines.

The main opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is also planning a strong protest on the floor of the assembly, if the speaker does not issue the production order for former railways minister Khwaja Saad Rafique, who has been in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) along with his brother Salman Rafique in connection with an inquiry into a housing society scam.

Sources in the National Assembly Secretariat told Dawn that the speaker had already issued the production order for Leader of the Opposition Shahbaz Sharif while the process of the issuance of the production order for Mr Rafique was under way.

Seventh session of National Assembly begins today

Mr Sharif has been attending the NA sessions and meetings of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on the speaker’s production orders since his arrest by NAB on Oct 6 last year in the Ashiyana housing scam.

Mr Rafique had been arrested by NAB on Dec 11 last year at a time when the assembly was already in session. The opposition parties had lodged a strong protest and even boycotted most of the sittings before the speaker issued production order only a day before prorogation of the house on Dec 21.

The speaker has already summoned a meeting of the House Business Advisory Committee comprising representatives of all the parties present in the assembly before start of the session in which he is expected to take up the issue of the formation of the committees, besides discussing the agenda for the upcoming session which is expected to continue for more than two weeks as the government intends to present a mini-budget on Jan 23.

Finance Minister Asad Umar, while speaking to the members of the business community during his visit to the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Saturday, had announced that the government would present a mini-budget on Jan 23 and dispelled the impression that it would be loaded with new taxes.

Mr Umar had admitted that last year had been difficult not only for the government but also for the business community as during the five months (July-November) of the current financial year, only $818 million came under Foreign Direct Investment against $1.35 billion in the same period last financial year.

The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the PML-N are questioning the government’s move to present second mini-budget in less than six months.

Strongly opposing the plan, PPP’s vice president Senator Sherry Rehman had asked if the government, which was determined to bring about a revolution, would introduce mini-budgets every four months. She alleged that the mini-budget was being unveiled to meet the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund.

She regretted that just a day after an increase in the prices of drugs, the government announced its plans about unveiling a mini-budget.

Similarly, the PML-N leaders, including former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, had also questioned the government’s move to present another mini-budget. Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, the PML-N leaders had lashed out at the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government for its “directionless and failed” economic policies, which had drastically brought down the country’s growth rate in just five months.

House committees

Despite succeeding in breaking the deadlock between the government and the opposition over the issue of the PAC chairmanship last month, Speaker Asad Qaiser is still struggling to complete the process of the formation of house committees.

The delay in the formation of over three dozen committees has badly affected the legislative work of parliament, and the National Assembly which came into existence in August after the general elections held in July is functioning with only two committees, including the PAC.

Sources said that an understanding between the government and the opposition had already been reached on the distribution of the chairmanship of 38 standing committees. Under the agreed formula, the chairmanship of 18 committees would go to the opposition while the remaining 20 committees would be headed by the PTI and its allies.

However, they said, the two sides were yet to discuss the committees to be distributed among the treasury and the opposition members. The opposition parties, the sources said, wanted to head the important committees like interior, foreign affairs, power and finance.

The speaker had met Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan and the opposition leaders in the last two days and after his meeting with the government and the opposition representatives, he expressed the hope that he would constitute the committees during the session.

Meanwhile, the NA Secretariat on Sunday issued a nine-point agenda for the Monday’s sitting which includes presentation of a report by the government on “I-Voting Pilot test in 35 constituencies held on October 14 last year, as required under Section 94 of the Elections Act, 2017”.

148,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457450/minister-terms-all-previous-budgets-fake,"Minister terms all previous budgets fake
",2019-01-14,"LAHORE: Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Sunday said that all previous budgets were fake and now real budgets were being presented.

“The upcoming January 23 mini-budget will lay a foundation of Pakistan’s strong economy,” he said and added that the PTI government would come up to the expectations of people.

The information minister’s remarks come a day after Finance Minister Asad Umar on Saturday dispelled the impression that the upcoming mini-budget would be loaded with new taxes. While addressing members of the business community in Karachi, Mr Umar had said that the mini-budget would focus on ease of doing business and measures to facilitate trade and industrialisation.

Says governance will improve in two to three years

The information minister urged people to have trust in the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, adding that governance would improve in two to three years.

“Have patience for two to three years and this government’s governance will be of par excellence,” he told the media at ThinkFest at Alhamra Arts Council.

Mr Chaudhry said PM Khan did not believe in giving relief (NRO) to any corrupt.

“One has already landed in jail, while the other will follow suit,” he said while referring to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and ex-president Asif Ali Zardari, respectively.

He reiterated that Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari were pressurising (the government) in and out of parliament but they would not get any NRO.

The information minister said that Mr Sharif’s and Mr Zardari’s parties had collapsed.

“They have dug their political graves with their style of politics. We didn’t contribute anything [to their troubles],” Mr Chaudhry said.

The minister expressed wonder over the way the trial of Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif was being conducted, saying they were enjoying all freedom when compared with incarceration of Wali Khan, Faiz Ahmad Faiz and other high-profile people who remained in prison. “Nawaz Sharif flew to London during his trial and his lawyers cross-examined witnesses for 22 days.”

He said that Opposition Leader in National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif was in jail only on papers as he was living in his house and holding meetings and sometimes even called the NAB and prosecutors to appear before him. “I haven’t seen such a trial in my life,” he said and added, “still they are heading towards their political death”.

Responding to a question about former US Ambassador Cameron Munter that Pakistan had misused funds given by the US to counter terrorism as well as promote education, Mr Chaudhry brushed aside Mr Munter’s statement, saying he had retired long ago and did not know anything happening now.

He pointed out that the US had already discontinued the Coalition Support Fund. However, he added, Pakistan-US relations were now improving. He said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had visited Pakistan and later Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi met him in Washington leading to improvement in Pak-US ties.

“I guess Munter has not visited Washington for quite some time,” he said.

Referring to the PPP leaders’ names on the ECL, he said the direction was given by the JIT and the government had just implemented it.

Regarding his re-scheduled visit to Sindh and PPP minister Saeed Ghani’s assertion that he could stop him entering Sindh, Mr Chaudhry said Sindh was part of Pakistan and no one could stop him from going there. He said he was going to Sindh in connection with the affairs of his ministry and would obviously meet his colleagues there.

Mr Chaudhry said the information ministry would come up with a calendar of mega events in the country in a couple of weeks to allow space to thinkers and writers to speak up their minds.

Emphasising the need for promotion of tourism, he said Pakistan had decided to allow visa-free entry to people from 66 countries.

“People from across the globe will be invited to participate in various literary, cultural, social and religious festivals,” the minister said and added that the government was working on mechanisms to keep the events safe.

“PM Imran Khan’s vision is not just political but also social, and he wants to generate activity that will bring people closer unlike past rulers, who only worked to fill their coffers,” Mr Chaudhry said.

",2019-01-14,"UN experts on Sunday urged Pakistan not to carry out the “arbitrary execution” of a former police officer who suffers from mental illness.

The execution of Khizar Hayat, sentenced to death in 2003 for killing a colleague, was suspended by the Supreme Court on Saturday, his legal team said, just three days before the 55-year-old was due to be hanged.

The top court will on Monday hold a hearing into whether the execution can go ahead, according to a press release from Justice Project Pakistan, an NGO handling Hayat's case.

The group welcomed the “timely intervention by the highest seat of justice in the land to prevent a wrongful execution,” and also gave Khayat's age as 60.

Editorial: Mr President, halt Khizar’s execution

“The imposition of capital punishment on individuals with psychosocial disabilities is a clear violation of Pakistan's international obligations,” said Agnes Callamard, UN expert on extrajudicial executions and Catalina Devandas, the special rapporteur on disabled rights.

Hayat, who has spent more than 15 years in custody, has been kept in solitary confinement since 2012, the UN experts said, urging the government to halt the execution and questioning the veracity of his conviction.

“During his trial, no evidence or witnesses were called in his defence and no questions were asked regarding his mental health, although he was later diagnosed with a mental health condition and has been receiving treatment for the past 10 years,” they said.

“Implementing the death penalty under these conditions is unlawful and tantamount to an arbitrary execution, as well as a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment,” the UN panel said.

Two years ago, experts from the World Psychiatric Association also appealed to Pakistan to halt his execution, saying he was suffering from schizophrenia and did not understand the crime he had committed.

Government doctors had diagnosed Hayat as suffering from schizophrenia in 2008.

",2019-01-13,"Former United States ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter on Sunday said President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Imran Khan ""may find some sort of common ground"" if and when a meeting is held between the two leaders.

Addressing an event organised by the Karachi Council on Foreign Relations, the former envoy said Trump and Khan are in power because they both have ""very good political sense"".

""They have the fingertip feeling, as we say, they're very clever with people,"" he said while speaking at the event, 'Brunch & Conversation with Ambassador Cameron Munter', held at Karachi's Movenpick Hotel.

Munter said there was a possibility that if the two leaders meet, they might find some common ground that could help improve their bilateral relationship.""Not the kind that typical analytical diplomats find, but they may find that there is common ground in some way,"" he added.

On January 2, President Trump had expressed his desire to meet Prime Minister Khan for talks on US-led efforts to jump-start the Afghan peace process. “I look forward to meeting the folks from the new leadership in Pakis­tan [and] we will be doing that in not-too-distant future,” he had said.

Following this, the Foreign Office had welcomed Trump’s remarks on ties with Pakistan and said the government was keenly waiting for the engagement at the highest level.

“We look forward to positive engagement with the US at the leadership level,” FO spokesman Dr Mohammad Faisal had said during a weekly media briefing.

During the event today, Munter expressed a desire for better relations between Washington and Islamabad, DawnNewsTV reported.

The former US envoy said that at a tactical level there was still a sense that the kind of ties the United States has with the Pakistani military are ""valuable and important, if for no other reason then that there is still a residual [American] force in Afghanistan"".

He said it was the ""competence"" of the Pakistan Army that made them a ""good partner"" for Washington, and cited the example of the 2010 floods in Pakistan. During the catastrophic floods, he said he had opted not to call the PPP government to help the affected people, and instead approached the Pakistani military.",dawn | Qazi Hassan,"['former', 'united', 'states', 'ambassador', 'pakistan', 'cameron', 'munter', 'sunday', 'said', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'may', 'find', 'sort', 'common', 'ground', 'meeting', 'held', 'two', 'leaders', 'addressing', 'event', 'organised', 'karachi', 'council', 'foreign', 'relations', 'former', 'envoy', 'said', 'trump', 'khan', 'power', 'good', 'political', 'sense', 'fingertip', 'feeling', 'say', 'clever', 'people', 'said', 'speaking', 'event', 'brunch', 'conversation', 'ambassador', 'cameron', 'munter', 'held', 'karachi', 'movenpick', 'hotel', 'munter', 'said', 'possibility', 'two', 'leaders', 'meet', 'might', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'could', 'help', 'improve', 'bilateral', 'relationship', 'kind', 'typical', 'analytical', 'diplomats', 'find', 'may', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'way', 'added', 'january', '2', 'president', 'trump', 'expressed', 'desire', 'meet', 'prime', 'minister', 'khan', 'talks', 'usled', 'efforts', 'jumpstart', 'afghan', 'peace', 'process', 'look', 'forward', 'meeting', 'folks', 'new', 'leadership', 'pakistan', 'nottoodistant', 'future', 'said', 'following', 'foreign', 'office', 'welcomed', 'trump', 'remarks', 'ties', 'pakistan', 'said', 'government', 'keenly', 'waiting', 'engagement', 'highest', 'level', 'look', 'forward', 'positive', 'engagement', 'us', 'leadership', 'level', 'fo', 'spokesman', 'dr', 'mohammad', 'faisal', 'said', 'weekly', 'media', 'briefing', 'event', 'today', 'munter', 'expressed', 'desire', 'better', 'relations', 'washington', 'islamabad', 'dawnnewstv', 'reported', 'former', 'us', 'envoy', 'said', 'tactical', 'level', 'still', 'sense', 'kind', 'ties', 'united', 'states', 'pakistani', 'military', 'valuable', 'important', 'reason', 'still', 'residual', 'american', 'force', 'afghanistan', 'said', 'competence', 'pakistan', 'army', 'made', 'good', 'partner', 'washington', 'cited', 'example', '2010', 'floods', 'pakistan', 'catastrophic', 'floods', 'said', 'opted', 'call', 'ppp', 'government', 'help', 'affected', 'people', 'instead', 'approached', 'pakistani', 'military']","['trump', 'pm', 'khan', 'may', 'find', 'sort', 'common', 'ground', 'meeting', 'exus', 'envoy', 'munter']"
153,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457278/mohmand-dam-inauguration-ceremony-postponed-again,"Mohmand Dam inauguration ceremony postponed again
",2019-01-13,"The much-awaited inauguration ceremony of the Mohmand Dam scheduled for Sunday was postponed for at least the second time this month, government officials said.

The ceremony for the dam was to be held on January 2 but was rescheduled until today due to a controversy that emerged following the award of the contract of the hydropower project.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Minister Shaukat Yousafzai confirmed to DawnNewsTV that the ceremony today had been postponed.

Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Media Iftikhar Durrani said a new date would be announced after consultation with Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who would attend the inauguration ceremony.

Durrani ruled out the impression that the project's inauguration had been delayed due to any controversies. He said the tender for the project was awarded in the PML-N government's tenure and the incumbent government had no role in the matter.

Chief Justice Nisar had last week taken offence over not being informed about the rescheduling of the ceremony and had said he may not attend.

Justice Nisar has paid close attention to the issue of water scarcity and had ordered the creation of the Dam Fund in July last year ─ a fund that appeals to the general public and overseas Pakistanis for donations for the construction of the Mohmand Dam and the Diamer-Bhasha Dam.

The top judge's initiative was later joined by the prime minister. Within a span of five months, a total of Rs8.46bn was deposited in The Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of Pakistan Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand Dams Fund, according to State Bank of Pakistan data in December 2018.

Justice Nisar and Prime Minister Imran Khan were to be the chief guests of today's event.

Mohmand Dam contract controversy

The dam contract was awarded on a single-bid basis to a consortium of three companies led by Descon, a company previously owned by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, in which he and his family members currently hold ownership stakes.

A second contestant for the bid, a consortium comprising the Frontier Works Organisation, Andritz Hydro and Power China was technically disqualified and its financial bid was not considered, some top-ranking national contractors cited by Dawn said earlier.

The award of the bid to the Descon-led consortium raised questions about a possible conflict of interest and the process of the award.

Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda claimed the controversy around the award of the dam's contract has been created ""on the agenda of international powers"".

He said that Dawood had already resigned from the company before the bidding was held on July 18 ─ before the new government came to power. He added that the PM's adviser had nothing to do with the contract and had no way to influence the bidding process.

Descon only holds 30pc of shares in the consortium and the bids were evaluated by technical experts comprising Nespak, an Australian company, and another foreign firm, according to Vawda.

Wapda Chairman Hussain said that it was coincidental that the single bidder's price was also almost the same as estimated by the government and insisted there was no conflict of interest in the award of the contract to a company having links with a sitting cabinet member.

Although Hussain agreed that Descon was linked to Dawood, he maintained it had nothing to do with the bidding conducted by Wapda and dismissed the notion that he or the body was facing pressure over the groundbreaking of the project.

Abdul Razak Dawood in a statement also explained that he had founded and headed Descon like several other business ventures, but had disclosed all his business associations in writing to the prime minister and resigned from these positions before joining the government to ensure transparency and avoid conflict of interest.

The Mohmand Dam project

The construction of the Rs309 billion Mohmand dam ─ which will be situated on the Swat river in the Manda area ─ is said to be imperative to resolve the problems of water scarcity and electricity shortfall in the country.

A sum of Rs2bn has been allocated for the project in the Public Sector Development Programme 2018-19.

Work on the dam will begin this month and is expected to be complete within five years. It will have the capacity to store 0.676 MAF of water and generate 800 megawatts of electricity. It will also irrigate 16,000 acres of land and increase agricultural production in the area.

The completion of the project will require 8,668 acres of land mostly in Mohmand tribal district and some parts of Bajaur and Malakand.",dawn | Sirajuddin,"['muchawaited', 'inauguration', 'ceremony', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'scheduled', 'sunday', 'postponed', 'least', 'second', 'time', 'month', 'government', 'officials', 'said', 'ceremony', 'dam', 'held', 'january', '2', 'rescheduled', 'today', 'due', 'controversy', 'emerged', 'following', 'award', 'contract', 'hydropower', 'project', 'khyber', 'pakhtunkhwa', 'information', 'minister', 'shaukat', 'yousafzai', 'confirmed', 'dawnnewstv', 'ceremony', 'today', 'postponed', 'special', 'assistant', 'prime', 'minister', 'media', 'iftikhar', 'durrani', 'said', 'new', 'date', 'would', 'announced', 'consultation', 'chief', 'justice', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'would', 'attend', 'inauguration', 'ceremony', 'durrani', 'ruled', 'impression', 'project', 'inauguration', 'delayed', 'due', 'controversies', 'said', 'tender', 'project', 'awarded', 'pmln', 'government', 'tenure', 'incumbent', 'government', 'role', 'matter', 'chief', 'justice', 'nisar', 'last', 'week', 'taken', 'offence', 'informed', 'rescheduling', 'ceremony', 'said', 'may', 'attend', 'justice', 'nisar', 'paid', 'close', 'attention', 'issue', 'water', 'scarcity', 'ordered', 'creation', 'dam', 'fund', 'july', 'last', 'year', 'fund', 'appeals', 'general', 'public', 'overseas', 'pakistanis', 'donations', 'construction', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'diamerbhasha', 'dam', 'top', 'judge', 'initiative', 'later', 'joined', 'prime', 'minister', 'within', 'span', 'five', 'months', 'total', 'rs846bn', 'deposited', 'supreme', 'court', 'pakistan', 'prime', 'minister', 'pakistan', 'diamerbhasha', 'mohmand', 'dams', 'fund', 'according', 'state', 'bank', 'pakistan', 'data', 'december', '2018', 'justice', 'nisar', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'chief', 'guests', 'today', 'event', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'contract', 'controversy', 'dam', 'contract', 'awarded', 'singlebid', 'basis', 'consortium', 'three', 'companies', 'led', 'descon', 'company', 'previously', 'owned', 'adviser', 'prime', 'minister', 'commerce', 'abdul', 'razak', 'dawood', 'family', 'members', 'currently', 'hold', 'ownership', 'stakes', 'second', 'contestant', 'bid', 'consortium', 'comprising', 'frontier', 'works', 'organisation', 'andritz', 'hydro', 'power', 'china', 'technically', 'disqualified', 'financial', 'bid', 'considered', 'topranking', 'national', 'contractors', 'cited', 'dawn', 'said', 'earlier', 'award', 'bid', 'desconled', 'consortium', 'raised', 'questions', 'possible', 'conflict', 'interest', 'process', 'award', 'federal', 'minister', 'water', 'resources', 'faisal', 'vawda', 'claimed', 'controversy', 'around', 'award', 'dam', 'contract', 'created', 'agenda', 'international', 'powers', 'said', 'dawood', 'already', 'resigned', 'company', 'bidding', 'held', 'july', '18', 'new', 'government', 'came', 'power', 'added', 'pm', 'adviser', 'nothing', 'contract', 'way', 'influence', 'bidding', 'process', 'descon', 'holds', '30pc', 'shares', 'consortium', 'bids', 'evaluated', 'technical', 'experts', 'comprising', 'nespak', 'australian', 'company', 'another', 'foreign', 'firm', 'according', 'vawda', 'wapda', 'chairman', 'hussain', 'said', 'coincidental', 'single', 'bidder', 'price', 'also', 'almost', 'estimated', 'government', 'insisted', 'conflict', 'interest', 'award', 'contract', 'company', 'links', 'sitting', 'cabinet', 'member', 'although', 'hussain', 'agreed', 'descon', 'linked', 'dawood', 'maintained', 'nothing', 'bidding', 'conducted', 'wapda', 'dismissed', 'notion', 'body', 'facing', 'pressure', 'groundbreaking', 'project', 'abdul', 'razak', 'dawood', 'statement', 'also', 'explained', 'founded', 'headed', 'descon', 'like', 'several', 'business', 'ventures', 'disclosed', 'business', 'associations', 'writing', 'prime', 'minister', 'resigned', 'positions', 'joining', 'government', 'ensure', 'transparency', 'avoid', 'conflict', 'interest', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'project', 'construction', 'rs309', 'billion', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'situated', 'swat', 'river', 'manda', 'area', 'said', 'imperative', 'resolve', 'problems', 'water', 'scarcity', 'electricity', 'shortfall', 'country', 'sum', 'rs2bn', 'allocated', 'project', 'public', 'sector', 'development', 'programme', '201819', 'work', 'dam', 'begin', 'month', 'expected', 'complete', 'within', 'five', 'years', 'capacity', 'store', '0676', 'maf', 'water', 'generate', '800', 'megawatts', 'electricity', 'also', 'irrigate', '16000', 'acres', 'land', 'increase', 'agricultural', 'production', 'area', 'completion', 'project', 'require', '8668', 'acres', 'land', 'mostly', 'mohmand', 'tribal', 'district', 'parts', 'bajaur', 'malakand']","['mohmand', 'dam', 'inauguration', 'ceremony', 'postponed']"

",2019-01-13,"ISLAMABAD: Munir Ahmed, 52, has been living in Rawalpindi, where he works as a hawker at the Pirwadhai Bus Stand, for years.

Originally from Peshawar, Mr Ahmed said he earns around Rs1,000 a day, calling out to passengers and trying to persuade them to get the bus to Peshawar. Sometimes he doesn’t get any work at all, because of the lack of buses, transporters’ strikes or a protest in the city.

“I used to spend Rs200 a day on food, and at night I would get a charpoy at the bus stand for Rs60. But since the Panah Gah opened in I-11 last month, I first try to get a charpoy there, because it’s provided for free, and failing that I go to the bus stand,” he told Dawn.

Whether or not he gets a charpoy, Mr Ahmed has breakfast, lunch and dinner at the new shelter - altogether, he is able to save around Rs300 every day, and send more money back to his family every month.

Two shelters — one at the I-11 Sabzi Mandi and one in Tarlai — have been opened by the district administration under orders from the prime minister.

Both the shelters were set up in 20 days; the one in Tarlai can house around 150 men and 50 women, while the one in Sabzi Mandi can house 150 men and women.

There are a number of homeless shelters that have opened across the country, but most are run in tents. Islamabad is the only city with fully functional shelters in buildings, with staff deputed there as well.

But Mr Ahmed said the capacity at the shelter is insufficient. “The capacity for charpoys should be increased by tens of times. There are thousands of people who cannot even afford charpoys available for just Rs60 a night,” he said.

Jehangira-native Umer Daraz, 65, has a handcart on which he carries people’s goods.

“I have been working as a labourer despite becoming a senior citizen,” he told Dawn. “It is good that the Panah Gah has been established, but I suggest the government also introduce some honorarium for the elderly.”

Mohammad Kamran, 35, has also been staying at the shelter. Mr Kamran is from Abbotabad and works as a labourer; the free meals and accommodation at the shelter mean that he is able to save some money.

Ghulam Naseem Khan, 56, who belongs to a village near Mianwali, has been staying at the shelter as well. Mr Khan said he was forcefully retired from the army in 1993 because a gun was recovered from his possession.

The following inquiry proved he had a licence for the pistol, based on which it was decided that he would receive two-thirds of his pension.

“I have been running from pillar to post since then, but no one has listened to my problem,” he said. “I am staying in Rawalpindi so that one day I might get someone in [General Headquarters] who would listen to my problem.” In the meantime, Mr Khan is working as a labourer.

The caretaker of the I-11 shelter, Rosh Dil Khan Hoti, said the shelter building was owned by Haji Allah Rakha - also known as Mukhtar Shah - who would distribute free meals in a street in I-10 in the early 1980s.

“Some of the residents complained to the district administration that the street would be blocked because of the distribution of food, so the district administration stopped him.

“Later the assistant commissioner, Chaudhry Mohammad Ali, forwarded a request to President Ziaul Haq to allocate land for the free distribution of food, and in 1986 a two and a half kanal plot was allocated for the Langar Khana in I-11. They used to give free curry and charge for naan; initially it was just a few paisas, and by last year it was Rs5 per naan,” Mr Hoti said.

“When Prime Minister Imran Khan directed to establish Panah Gahs, we held a camp at the fruit market giving away free food.

“The Langar Khana contacted us and asked her to move the Panah Gah there. We involved philanthropists and not only contracted the building but a number of other facilities, such as a dispensary, food and residence have also been provided there,” he said.

Chief Commissioner Amer Ali Ahmed visited the site every day and pushed the staff, because of which the two-storey building was finished in 20 days and other facilities, such as televisions and so on, were also provided, he added.

“We provide residence on a first-come-first-serve basis daily, and all the particulars and every person’s details are not only registered but also shared with the police. We cook here, a tandoor has also been established here, and we pay all the staff,” he said.

In response to a question, Mr Hoti said commodities such as flour and pulses are preferred to cash donations.

A senior district administration official, who asked not to be named, also told Dawn it has been decided to increase the number of charpoys to 400 and arrange food for 1,000 people.

He added that the dining hall will be moved to the basement, and another floor will be added to provide accommodation to up to 1,000 people in a few weeks.

155,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457274/editorial-why-india-should-revive-saarc,"Editorial: Why India should revive Saarc
",2019-01-13,"Revive Saarc: the message is clear, sensible and ought to be heeded.

The foreign minister of Nepal, Pradip Gyawali, has called on India to revive the Saarc heads of state summit, the last round of which was to be hosted by Pakistan in 2016 but was cancelled after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused to travel to Pakistan and New Delhi leaned on other Saarc members to boycott the summit.

Meanwhile, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai has also added his voice to calls for the revival of Saarc and has spoken of the need for India and Pakistan to work together to reactivate the moribund organisation.

Mr Gyawali and Mr Karzai are right: Saarc needs to be revived and the multilateral forum should not be held hostage to bilateral tensions.

Indeed, Saarc could be a platform to address the very problems that India has wanted addressed by Pakistan, and Pakistan wants India to address.

It is striking that the smaller countries in Saarc are now openly recognising what has long been apparent: it is the countries of the region collectively that lose when dialogue and cooperation is suspended.

With a general election in India scheduled for later this year, there is a small window of opportunity before the Indian government goes into election mode and policy decisions are suspended.

There is no indication that Mr Modi and his government are seeking to reassess their approach to Pakistan ahead of a general election that could be closer than was expected until relatively recently.

But in seeking a second consecutive general election victory, Mr Modi and his team ought to recognise that the cycles of domestic politics and international relations are different and ought to be addressed separately.

Prime Minister Imran Khan and the military leadership in Pakistan have continued to express a desire for dialogue with India on mutually acceptable terms.

A generational shift may be imminent in Afghanistan and Pakistan and India could have pragmatic talks with Afghanistan on helping craft a stable and peaceful region.

India’s Kashmir policy has been disastrous and dialogue remains the only sensible path ahead.

Instead of blocking all avenues for dialogue, India should pay heed to what its regional friends and allies are telling it.

Revive Saarc, engage Pakistan, address regional security and economic issues, and move towards a more prosperous and peaceful region for all.

",2019-01-13,"In a session on ‘Muslim Women, Laws and Sexualities’, researcher Afia Zia and Fauzia Viqar spoke about the family laws and Muslim women with respect to socio-political order, secularism and feminism.

Viqar spoke about the challenges and obstacles that women in Pakistan faced within the law and in society.

Fauzia Viqar said there were three or four basic laws that guarantee women their rights in a family system, including the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (MFLO) formed in 1961, Dissolution of Marriage Act, the Child Custody Law and the Child Marriage Restraint Act, with amendments in 2017.

She said while these laws had made certain improvements there was a lot more left to do. She said the MFLO for the first time gave the right to divorce, the right to apply for khula (permission for divorce), and the right to refuse her husband another marriage.

Also read: Read this before you sign your nikah nama

She said it must be noted that the Christians, the Hindus and the Sikhs had their own marriage and divorce laws, although they too needed a lot of work on these to protect the women’s rights.

“We still see many problems arising from lack of implementation and the mindset starting from the judges down to the process servers,” she said.

She said the worst part was the discrimination between the ages of boys and girls in the Child Marriage Restraint Act where girls’ age is given as 16 years and boys’ age as 18 years.

“Whenever we speak about changing this, there seems to be an uproar as if we are going against the basic tenets of religion,” she said. “The same is the case with right to refuse polygamy. No one wants to accept this.”

Also read: A comprehensive list of things you can 'lightly beat' other than your wife

Ms Viqar also spoke of protection of women post divorce, and said that women must be given financial support after divorce. Women’s right in marital property should be divided equally too.

Meanwhile, Afia Zia, a feminist, researcher and author of ‘Faith and Feminism’ spoke about the women in Pakistan and how they had changed under every regime. She addressed the post-9/11 situation with regard to women movements in the Muslim context.

She said Gen Zia had politicised women’s sexuality and painted the image of immoral women as those who were open about themselves.

“Zina became an easy tool to control women with, and was used by the state, by society and by families and parents,” she said. “Four decades later women are still easy targets and are being used to further establish patriarchy in different ways.”

Also read: Like every other year, 2018 was the year of male rage

Speaking about women’s movements, Ms Zia said a prevailing notion was that there had been no rural movements, but she counted out the lady health workers’ movement that managed to regularise their positions, as well as raise their salaries across Pakistan, the Sindhyani tehreek (beginning from rural Sindh) and the women councillors’ and the hari movements.

“There is a difference of political positioning between women activists and feminists,” she added. “Feminists take on issues that impact more than just women. They speak of human rights essentially.”

In her book, Afiya Zia says that the Muslim women’s secular autonomy promises major transformation and effectively challenges Muslim male dominance.

In a session ‘Fog from London to Lahore’, Dr Christina Corton and Ahmed Rafay Alam spoke about the fog (now smog) that infected London back in the Victorian era while today Lahore was also suffering similarly.

Rafay said Lahore was suffering the same way and only Saturday’s air quality readings were 163 (AQ) and PM 2.5, which was double the limit. He said people must speak out against it.

",2019-01-13,"Illustration by Abro

The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), once the most dominant political party in Karachi, is in complete disarray. At the moment there are three factions of the party vying for the Mohajir vote and at least two sub-factions within one of the splinter groups.

The immediate memory associated with the MQM in the minds of the party’s supporters is that of an organisation that was able to stall the political and economic alienation of Sindh’s Mohajirs. The other immediate memory of the party — mostly held by its detractors — is of an outfit which plunged Sindh’s capital, Karachi, into ethnic turmoil and of heinous crimes allegedly committed by the party’s armed wings.

There are also those who have maintained that the party was the outcome of ‘political engineering’ undertaken by the ‘agencies’ at the behest of Gen Zia’s dictatorship (1977-88). This has often been repeated by various political analysts. Even though this claim has never been convincingly substantiated, it is possible that this indeed was the case before the party broke away from the agencies’ orbit sometime in the late 1980s.

Was the MQM simply engineered by Gen Zia or was there more to its history?

This perception is largely rooted in comments by some Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) leaders and then those belonging to the PPP. In 1986, when one of the worst ethnic riots in Karachi propelled the MQM into the forefront, the JI claimed that the party had been created by the Zia dictatorship to neutralise the support the JI once enjoyed in Karachi. The PPP, on the other hand, claimed that the party had been engineered to “balance out the PPP’s influence in Sindh.”

There are various theories about MQM’s formation. But there is enough agreement among historians and analysts about the train of events which led to the formation of a Mohajir nationalist outfit. Dr Tanvir A. Tahir’s book Political Dynamics of Sindh traces the roots of this evolution all the way back to the 1950s when, according to Tahir, the Mohajir community began to feel it was being pushed out of the country’s ruling and economic elite. Tahir writes that the Mohajirs had become part of this elite immediately after Pakistan’s creation in 1947 when the Punjabis dominated the military and the Mohajirs were prominent in the bureaucracy.

After the assassination of Pakistan’s first prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan (a Mohajir), the Mohajirs began to feel that they were being nudged out. According to Tahir, the Mohajirs — who had come in droves from various parts of India and had mainly settled in Sindh — did not find the need to become familiar with the Sindhi culture because they became a majority in Karachi. Tahir also writes that this delayed the formation of a Sindhi middle class because the Mohajirs immediately managed to bag important positions in the province’s economy and government from Karachi that had become the country’s first capital.

In 1954, a Mohajir politician, Mahmud-ul-Haq Usmani demanded that Karachi be made a separate Mohajir-majority province. But the imposition of the One Unit system, that clubbed West Pakistan as a single province, somewhat placated the Mohajir community which was suspicious of provinces being based on ethnic considerations.

According to Tanvir, the Mohajirs found themselves almost completely ousted from the ruling circles during the Ayub Khan regime in the 1960s. They vehemently took part in the 1968 anti-Ayub movement. But when, after Ayub’s departure in 1969, Gen Yahya Khan agreed to do away with the One Unit, the Mohajir groups protested against Karachi becoming part of Sindh.

The February 23, 1969, edition of daily Dawn reported the formation of a Jeay Karachi Committee. It was mainly led by a faction of the left-wing National Students Federation (NSF-Kazmi). The Committee demanded the creation of a “Karachi sooba (province).” Another organisation, the Mohajir Mahaz (MM) came into being in late 1969. But MM could win just one Sindh provincial assembly seat during the 1970 election. Mohajir vote largely went to JI and Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Pakistan (JUP).

In 1972, when the PPP-led Sindh government declared Sindhi as the province’s official language, groups of Mohajir students formed the Muttahida Tulaba Mahaz Karachi (MTMK). They asked car owners to change their number plates to Urdu and also attacked English signboards. Riots broke out between the police and the MTMK in Karachi and between Mohajir and Sindhi youth elsewhere in Sindh.

Usmani, who had demanded Karachi to be made a separate province in 1954, had joined the left-wing National Awami Party (NAP). But he lost the election in 1970. During the 1972 riots, he formed the Urdu Qaumi Council. The July 15, 1972, edition of daily Jang quotes the Council members as saying that the organisation was launched to “inculcate in the minds of Mohajirs, scientific consciousness of their history and culture.” The Council also demanded that the state treat Mohajirs as a separate ethnic community as it does the Punjabis, Sindhis, Baloch and Pakhtuns. Two years later, in 1974, a Karachi Province Movement was launched but it fizzled out.

The Mohajirs of Karachi played a leading role in the 1977 movement against the Bhutto regime. In 1978, two Karachi University (KU) students, Altaf Hussain and Azeem Ahmad Tariq formed the All Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO). In his 2011 biography, My Life’s Journey, Hussain writes that Mohajir youth were exploited by JI and JUP against the Bhutto regime.

In 1981, APMSO became a member of the progressive student alliance, the United Students Movement (USM) at Karachi University (KU). Hussain writes that JI’s youth wing “expelled” APMSO from KU and the party began to establish offices in Mohajir mohallas (localities).

According to their 2011 essay for Berkeley Journal of Social Sciences, Ali Chandio, M. Ahmad and F. Naseem quote famous Sindhi scholar Ibrahim Joyo as saying that “Punjabi economic hegemony” increased immensely in Sindh during the dictatorship of Gen Zia. This situation had a negative impact on the interests of Karachi’s prominent (non-Punjabi) business communities. This concern saw some members of these communities form an organisation called the Maha Sindh (MS) in 1983.

It was an organisation set up to protect the economic interests of Karachi’s Memon, Sindhi and Mohajir businessmen and traders. Chandio, Ahmad and Naseem write that Maha Sindh encouraged the formation of a Karachi-based party. Many APMSO members were involved in the party’s activities. MS eventually became a Mohajir-dominated organisation, which then evolved into becoming the MQM in 1984.

",2019-01-13,"IN an interview with a Turkish television channel, Prime Minister Imran Khan completely sidestepped a question about the condition of Uighur Muslims in China’s western Xinjiang province. He admitted that he knew little about the issue, and, instead, preferred to focus on and highlight Chinese financial assistance and investment in Pakistan.

China is under stiff criticism for its alleged persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, especially Uighur Muslims. Freedom House’s 2018 country report on China classified it as ‘religiously-not-free’ on its freedom index. China is seriously concerned about this growing perception that hurts its efforts to promote a ‘soft image’ of China for a successful execution of its Belt and Road Initiative and other global commercial and strategic projects. Last week, China said that it welcomed UN officials to visit Xinjiang provided that they stay out of its internal affairs.

Pakistan usually avoids commenting on China’s internal affairs. But many Pakistani men, married to Chinese Uighur women, claim their spouses are being held in so-called re-education camps and are demanding their release. The issue has put Pakistan in a difficult position, mainly due to China’s huge investment in the country, as well as the extreme sensitivity of Chinese authorities to discussions on the subject.

Mystery continues to shroud the nature of the camps in Xinjiang.

Mystery continues to shroud China’s re-education camps, with authorities least interested in opening them up to independent observers. However, Chinese scholars claim that they are a part of the country’s countering violent extremism strategy, which was not built in isolation from rest of the world. They assert that China has designed its re-education strategy after carefully examining CVE approaches in practice in the West and Muslim world, which also employ similar community engagement programmes. Though they tend to justify their muscular approach by quoting examples from the Gulf, and South and Southeast Asian Muslim nations, the Chinese CVE strategy still appears highly politicised and opaque to Western practitioners and policymakers.

Much of the information about China’s re-education centres comes from West. Though the criticism has forced Chinese authorities to ‘release’ some information, it is insufficient to make a proper assessment. Last year, a state-run news agency published an interview of Shohrat Zakir, the Xinjiang governor, describing the camps as “professional vocational training institutions” for people influenced by terrorism and extremism who have not committed an offence warranting criminal punishment.

Similarly, in a seminar in China last November, local scholars explained China’s CVE approaches. Alluding to diverse and disparate CVE practices in different countries, they tended to conclude that no uniform or global CVE programme exists. One Chinese scholar presented a four-layered model based on the four principles of breaking, establishing, preventing and developing. ‘Breaking’ referred to isolating individuals from an extremist environment; ‘establishing’ meant introducing them to the true spiritual values of religion; ‘preventing’ was seen as educating; and ‘developing’ was interpreted as a skill development programme.

However, one of the best works available on the subject of China’s CVE strategy is by Zunyou Zhou, a Germany-based Chinese scholar. In a paper published in the Journal of Terrorism and Political Violence in 2017, he noted that the Chinese CVE strategy is based on multiple approaches and, interestingly, that they consulted Western CVE and deradicalisation approaches extensively and then built their own, more muscular model. The approaches include ‘five keys’, ‘four prongs’, ‘three contingents’, ‘two hands’ and ‘one rule’. Viewed together, these approaches point to legal, religious, cultural, ideological, and scientific aspects of the deradicalisation effort, implemented by governmental agencies, public institutions and non-governmental organisations in the region.

The Xinjiang government has developed several programmes to target different groups of people, including those who are ‘radicalised’ as well as those who are not but considered vulnerable to recruitment. The ‘five keys’ — ideological, cultural, customary, religious and legal — give a long-sustaining solution to terrorism. The ‘four prongs’ refer to a combination of four methods: ‘squeezing by correct faith’; ‘counteracting by culture’; ‘controlling by law’; and ‘popularising science’. ‘Squeezing by correct faith’ refers to clarifying people’s understanding of Islam while ‘counteracting by culture’ means seeking effective and practical solutions to thwart extremism and guiding people towards secularisation and modernisation. The ‘three contingents’ refer to the policy of reinforcing three main groups of people the government can count on to maintain stability and security. The ‘two hands’ refer to the one ‘firm hand’ that cracks down on terrorists, and the other ‘firm hand’ that educates and guides Uighur people, and the ‘one rule’ means the policy of ruling Xinjiang according to the law.

The author also provides historical background on the evolution of the Chinese CVE strategy and mentions that it materialised in a policy document entitled Several Guiding Opinions on Further Suppressing Illegal Religious Activities and Combating the Infiltration of Religious Extremism in Accordance with Law, issued by Xinjiang’s CCP Committee in May 2013. The policy document was also referred to as ‘No. 11 Document’, and described the borders between ethnic customs, normal religious practices and extremist manifestations.

For the CVE strategy’s smooth implementation, the Xinjiang authorities have introduced new legal regimes, and the latest amendment (titled ‘Regulation on Anti-Extremism’) was introduced in April 2017 to ban a wide range of extremist behaviours. Under the new legal framework, authorities have launched many programmes including deradicalisation for prisoners, and social programmes for those who have engaged in terrorism or extremism but do not deserve criminal punishment.

The re-education camps — or ‘rehabilitation centres’ — have been created as a part of China’s social programming. These centres run through civil society groups in Xinjiang or through ‘Fang Hui Ju’ working groups, dispatched by the regional government, comprising practitioners tasked with winning the hearts and minds of the people.

For CVE practitioners, the Chinese model may have a lot of substance to learn from. But the Uighur problem is more complex than religious extremism, as it has added dimensions of ethnic, cultural and political rights. For Pakistan, the Chinese CVE model offers nothing to learn from except to find a way of resolving the issue of Pakistani citizens’ spouses held in these camps.

159,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457201/the-emperors-new-clothes,"The emperor’s new clothes
",2019-01-13,"THE emperor walked beneath the beautiful canopy in the procession, and all the people in the street and in their windows said, “Goodness, the emperor’s new clothes are incomparable! What a beautiful train on his jacket. What a perfect fit!” No one wanted it to be noticed that he could see nothing, for then it would be said that he was unfit for his position or that he was stupid. None of the emperor’s clothes had ever before received such praise.

“But he doesn’t have anything on!” said a small child.

Pakistan’s most recent emperor problem is about to exit. The tales are many but they shall have to wait until after retirement — and perhaps never be told. After all, when one emperor exits, another tends to quickly appear. The system abhors a vacuum of would-be saviours.

They’ve all stood silent as the emperor passed by them with his new clothes on.

Who knows the rabbits the next one will have us chasing after.

But as we bid farewell to one and prepare for the arrival of the next, let’s turn to the starring role in the Hans Christian Andersen tale: the child who cried, “But he doesn’t have anything on!”

Where is the Pakistani version of that child?

Someone to say, no, this is wrong, you can’t do that. Stick to your job, stop interfering, stop pretending you know better, stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Stop trying to invent reality!

Or even a mild version of that.

Where is the person within the system willing to say no?

It can’t be that hard; it isn’t that hard. Especially within the court. An odious character showed the way recently, but for the wrong reasons and in a terrible way. But what happened to him? Stripped of his high-court judgeship, he’s been sent home.

That’s it. He lost his job and maybe his pension and probably a shot at one of those post-retirement sinecures that abound. For some that’s a lot to sacrifice and maybe even too much. But not for everyone.

And yet they’ve all stood silent as the emperor passed by them with his new clothes on.

It is possible that the more damage was caused by Iftikhar Chaudhry. He didn’t just think he was the messiah, he had proved that he was — who else can claim to have slain a dictator through mere defiance in a robe.

The worst thing about Chaudhry was that he was aware of what he had achieved and had an appreciation for the system — and his potentially limitless role within it. Chaudhry may have been mocked for trying to fix the price of sugar and excoriated for wading into the Steel Mills sale, but it was his eye for institutional and constitutional re-jigging that was truly dangerous.

Had it not been for the unavoidable judicial retirement age locked into the Constitution — who knows where we’d be today.

In contrast, the current occupant can seem tame. Flitting here and there, disrupting private and state business, it hasn’t really amounted to much. No prime ministers ousted — though maybe that was already done — no shockwaves through the system, nothing that can’t be patiently reversed.

But he could yet end up being worse because of something else: a willingness to break out of the judicial straitjacket and head for the orchestra pit itself, conducting an incoherent symphony.

Chaudhry is more famous, a trailblazer, as it were, but the incumbent has raised the populist bar. In theory, it’s easy enough for the successor to walk back: just don’t do what the predecessor has done.

But it may not be that easy.

First, you need a willingness to do so — to walk back some of the excesses and make the institution less of a lightning rod. But before the incumbent became the best known judge in the land, there was another.

To be overshadowed is a worrying place to start from.

Second, the judge headed for the exit has already taken the hit for being unconventional. The folksy, always-in-the-headlines, being-the-centre-of-everything model is already here and the public has been primed to accept and enjoy it.

Third, it is real power and leverage. Whimsical, arbitrary and fierce may be hard to make institutional sense of, but when you’re pounding the gavel and working the headlines, you are creating significant space for yourself within the system. Folk ignore your orders and ignore you at their peril.

All of which to say, more than ever we may need that child to cry, “But he doesn’t have anything on!”

It is depressing to think that there is no such man, woman or child here.

So maybe all we can do is remember how the Hans Christen Andersen fable The Emperor’s New Clothes ends:

“Good Lord, let us hear the voice of an innocent child!” said the father, and whispered to another what the child had said.

“A small child said that he doesn’t have anything on!”

Finally everyone was saying, “He doesn’t have anything on!”

The emperor shuddered, for he knew that they were right, but he thought, “The procession must go on!” He carried himself even more proudly, and the chamberlains walked along behind carrying the train that wasn’t there.

The End.

The procession must go on. The emperor has no clothes. There is no child here in this luckless land of ours to tell us the truth.

They confided to Dawn on condition of anonymity that the NLC officials exchanged hot words with a staff member of immigration after he distributed stamped passports to Afghan nationals without informing them.

The sources said that the NLC had unilaterally taken upon itself the responsibility of seizing all the stamped passports from immigration staff after completion of necessary paperwork by the Federal Investigation Authority.

They said that the NLC personnel questioned the distribution of passports on Thursday to which the FIA staff objected as the former was not authorised to interfere in the official work of immigration. They said that the NLC personnel then entered the offices of FIA and hurled abuses at the immigration staff besides thrashing some of them who objected to their interference.

The accused, including Asad Katlang, Sabir Mayar, Arif Khan and Izharullah alias Johny, who were arrested after remaining at large for a long time, were indicted on Sept 11, 2018, for involvement in the killing of Mashal Khan.

The court, which has been conducting in-camera proceedings, fixed Jan 19 for the next hearing after summoning some other prosecution witnesses.

Mashal’s father, Mohammad Iqbal, is also a complainant in the case.

Barrister Amirullah Khan Chamkani, Shah Khattak and Fazal Khan represented Mohammad Iqbal in the case.

Mashal Khan, a 23-year-old student of the Department of Mass Communication at the AWKU, Mardan, was lynched by a mob over the blasphemy allegation on Apr 13, 2017.

On Feb 7, an anti-terrorism court had convicted 31 of the 57 accused in the lynching case, awarding death sentence to the prime accused, Imran Khan, life imprisonment to five of them and three-year imprisonment to 25 others.

However, the court, which conducted the trial inside the Haripur Central Prison, had acquitted 26 of the accused, observing that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them.

It had also declared the allegation of blasphemy against Mashal false.

",2019-01-13,"ISLAMABAD: The management of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) has decided to constitute an independent committee to investigate incidents of deaths of patients.

The decision has been made after a number of incidents in which relatives beat up doctors following the death of their patient or doctors held strikes after clashes with relatives of patients.

“I get annoyed with such incidents. A number of times relatives of deceased patients held protests and beat up doctors. Moreover, the media highlighted the incidents and spoke only in favour of the patients.

“On the other hand, a number of times doctors held protests and strikes after such incidents,” Pims’ Executive Director (ED) Dr Raja Amjad told Dawn.

He said a few days ago a child was brought to the children hospital in a critical condition.

Though a doctor suggested conducting dialysis, the nephrology department doctors were of the view that dialysis could not be done on the child because he was very weak.

“In the meantime, the child died and it became a big issue. Even a mediaperson reached the hospital and blamed the ‘irresponsible’ behaviour of doctors for the death.”

In most of the cases, Dr Amjad said, patients were brought to the hospital at the last stage due to which it becomes almost impossible for doctors to save their life.

A few days ago a swine flu patient was admitted to a private hospital at H-8. Later, he was shifted to another private hospital at G-8 and when the private hospital doctors told his relatives that the patient cannot survive, he was shifted to Pims, he said.

“It becomes impossible to treat such patients. However, after the death of the patient, his relatives started blaming the doctors of Pims.

“I assume that soon doctors would stop treating very serious patients because of fear that they would be blamed for the death,” Dr Amjad said.

Pims is a tertiary care hospital and every day eight to 10 patients die here. Though inquiry committees are established in all the units, “we have also set up a ‘death review committee’ but patients and their relatives never trust such committees.”

He said the management has now decided to establish the independent committee in which even representatives of the media and civil society would also be included.

“I would request relatives of patients to file complaints with the committee rather than protesting and beating doctors after the death of a patient,” Dr Amjad said.

The group met on Jan 11-12 in Islamabad to assess the programme progress, opportunities and the remaining challenges towards achieving the goal of stopping transmission of the poliovirus.

Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Babar Bin Atta said the government was committed to eradicating the poliovirus.

“I suggest that all parents should ensure that their children would be vaccinated. Civil society, media and religious scholars should also play their role to create awareness. I am hopeful the virus would be completely eradicated from Pakistan during year 2019,” he said.

Director General Ministry of National Health Services Dr Asad Hafeez said though the last mile to eradicate the virus was most difficult the government was committed to doing so.

National Coordinator Emergency Operation Centre for Polio Dr Rana Safdar said children who were missed during the campaigns become reason for the spread of poliovirus.

“However we are focussing more on the areas where poliovirus is present and hope that things will improve soon,” he said.

Former provincial minister Sardar Tanvir Ilyas has been instrumental in bringing investments worth more than $10 billion in the country during the past decade.

“Foreign investment was the need of the hour to support the economy of country and boost exports,” Mr Khan said in a statement adding that Pakistan needed sustainable investments and higher exports would also improve the foreign currency reserves of the country.

He said that most of the strong economies of the world had benefitted from foreign investments and Pakistan too could become a strong and stable economy by strengthening industrial base along with exports.

",2019-01-13,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Athar Minallah on Saturday said live coverage of judges’ speech and its subsequent airing on broadcast media is against the code of conduct of the adjudicators.

During the certificate distribution ceremony of a six-day training course on “Leadership and management” for district and sessions judges held at the Federal Judicial Academy, Justice Minallah stopped mediapersons from live coverage of his speech and also asked them not to even record the speech for subsequent airing, saying it was against the code of conduct of superior judiciary judges.

Justice Qazi Faez Isa of the Supreme Court in November last year had politely refused to answer questions asked by mediapersons after delivering a keynote address on “Future of Pakistan” in the UK, saying it was against the ethical practice if a judge speaks to the media.

Justice Athar Minallah stops mediapersons from live coverage and recording of his speech at certificate distribution ceremony

Justice Athar Minallah distributed certificates as chief guest among 25 heads of the district judiciary from all over Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir.

In his address, he said leadership and management training was vital for promoting and ensuring rule of law.

“It is essential to be an effective leader so as to make an impact within your organisation.A single good leader can create an endless chain of social changes. First of all, a good leader always puts his or her house in order. District and sessions court judges are important leaders of judicial system because the district judiciary is an important tier of the administration of justice system.”

Justice Minallah also spoke about some of the important qualities of a good leader such as honesty, integrity, inspiring others, good communication and decision-making capabilities.

“For all leaders whether they belong to politics, judiciary, sports or any other discipline, the attributes of good leadership are the same. When a leader is honest, his honesty has the trickle-down effect. District and sessions judges as leaders must put in practice their leadership attributes to reform the district judiciary and ameliorate the plight of the litigant public who are the key stakeholders of the administration of justice system.”

Lamenting growing nepotism in society, he said: “The menace of nepotism has become a way of life in our society. As leaders, district and sessions court judges must play the desired role to combat nepotism which has permeated into the very fabric of society.”

The IHC CJ also highlighted issues related to petitioners and said after his maiden visit to the district courts Islamabad he realised the miseries of the citizens and was embarrassed to note that the courts gave relief to powerful while the cases of real stakeholders kept pending for decades.

“There is no proper sitting area for the litigants in the district courts of Islamabad and the district administration should take appropriate steps to provide proper facilities to the litigants who come to seek justice from the courts”, he added.

Security agencies have also warned of any untoward incident within the district courts and the administration must adopt measures to ensure safety and security of the courts premises, he added.

The training course was carried out through syndicate discussions, command tasks, presentations and conducted in a participatory process. The participants obtained an in-depth understanding of leadership and management for effective administration of justice system.

Dr Farhat Abbas is the convener and Dr Tayyaba Sultana and Dr Naeem Iqbal are members of the committee which will conclude its findings within three days.

The notification issued by the assistant registrar establishment on Friday reads; “Consequent upon the concerns shown by the office of the chief minister of Punjab regarding display of picture of Prime Minister of Pakistan on the banners and flexes of the ‘PM Laptop Distribution Scheme’ by the directorate of Student Affairs of the university, against the vision of the government, the Vice Chancellor, by taking a serious notice of the occurrence, has constituted the committee.”

Sources privy to the development told Dawn that the university officials were aware of the fact that the prime minister was against publicity but they still carried his picture on the suggestion of some Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf workers.

A university official said senior police and district administration officers had used the pictures of Chief Minister Usman Buzdar while holding open courts on Friday. He said the officers had also used this opportunity for their own publicity as their pictures too were displayed on the flexes unfurled at the venue.

He said it’s a contradiction on the part of the government as no action had been taken against these officials and a probe had been initiated in case of the university.

",2019-01-13,"LAHORE: Former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar said Pakistan always chose to be a client state instead of becoming strategic partner of one country or the other. With a begging bowl in both hands, Pakistan cannot command respect in the comity of nations.

Speaking in a session on the US-Pakistan relationship at ThinkFest here on Saturday, she said Pakistan always imagined itself as a complete strategic partner, which was far-fetched. Pakistan’s most important relations should be with its neighbouring countries like Afghanistan, India, Iran and China instead of the US. “The US does not deserve that much importance as is given in Pakistan because our economy is not dependent on US aid, as is widely believed.”

Referring to the incumbent rulers’ claims of copying China, she said Beijing had brought its people out of poverty, while the Islamabad rulers were doing the opposite.

United States Institute of Peace Associate Vice President Moeed Yusuf said the US-Pakistan relations were non-existent during the past 18 months. Regretting that Pakistan was looking elsewhere instead of involving itself in the region to resolve local and regional issues, he said there could be no conversation on the US-Pak ties till the Afghanistan issue was resolved. For Pakistan, he said, the idea was to consider how to work with the US and China simultaneously.

Speaking on the future of democracy in Pakistan, author Aqil Shah from Oklahoma University said democracy gave the freedom to speak up and enabled accommodating ethnic divisions peacefully. He, however, said the democracy in vogue in Pakistan was a hybrid regime where elected representatives were answerable to both the people and army generals.

He alleged that the 2018 general elections were manoeuvered to ensure that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his party did not come back to power and that the rule was given to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), calling the ruling party “Pakistan Tehreek-i-Establishment”.

He further said that the corruption narrative was a universal phenomenon and not exclusive to Pakistan.

Federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood claimed that democracy in Pakistan was getting stronger and robust. While the PTI government took over just a few months ago, people had high expectations from them to resolve serious issues, including the economic crisis.

He said education had faced a serious neglect in the past and was separated into different streams to create a divide among people. He said there was a small pool of audience attending the ThinkFest, but even this much crowd could not be attracted if the event took place in Dera Ghazi Khan or Sibbi.

",2019-01-13,"LAHORE: Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmad says the government will have to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) sooner or later to improve the economic situation of the country.

“In such a situation, the governments cannot avoid the IMF and the PTI government also will have to go to the IMF finally,” the minister told the media on the premises of the Planning and Development Department.

He said being a member of the Economic Coordination Committee he was in contact with Finance Minister Asad Umar on the matter of mini-budget and other issues.

“I am sure there would be no pressure on the poor in the mini-budget,” Mr Rashid believed, saying the government had collected about US $4 to 6 billion from other countries, enabling it to minimise its dependence on the IMF.

He appreciated Chief Minister Usman Buzdar for directing the P&D department to revive Nullah Lai project and complete it within the stipulated timeframe. The project cost had exceeded to Rs40bn from Rs16bn due to various issues — such as cost escalation and increase in length of the project for 6km, he claimed.

Says he will ask PM to accommodate him as PAC member

Earlier, at a press conference at the railways headquarters, Mr Rashid said he would ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to accommodate him as member of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) by dropping someone from the PTI.

“Since I am representing a separate political party, I will write to the PM to also include me in the PAC. There is no issue in my appointment as PAC member,” he said.

Talking about the ongoing reforms in the railways, he said there was a plan to construct shopping malls at Rohri and other major railway stations.

He said Railways would soon introduce a gift scheme on tickets just like some airlines give to their passengers.

“We are inviting Prime Minister Imran Khan for inauguration of Lahore railway station’s main hall and new trains,” he added.

",2019-01-13,"LAHORE: Former foreign minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri said long-lasting peace between Pakistan and India is possible through people-to-people contact.

“We have taken the Kartarpur initiative believing that no progress can be achieved regarding peace between the two countries without people-to-people contact. In fact, long-lasting peace is only possible through this, but unfortunately it has not begun yet,” Mr Kasuri said at a talk, titled ‘Indian elections and the possibility of South Asian peace’, held on the first day of ThinkFest at Alhamra here on Saturday. Senior journalist Najam Sethi moderated the discussion.

Mr Kasuri said he was optimistic about resumption of talks between the two countries that would lead to good relations. “As Prime Minister Imran Khan said, what option are we left with if not war… peace is the only option,” he said, adding that if the Indian opposition parties created a formidable alliance against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it might win and form the next government.

“And even if Mr Modi returns to power, he will have to hold peace talks with Pakistan. He has already come to Lahore,” he added.

Prof Dibyesh Anand of the University of Westminster, UK was critical of the Modi government, saying hate politics would not work for the BJP nor would anti-Pakistan politics. “Internal issues matter the most for them. Even in Pakistan people are more concerned about the internal issues.”

He predicted that the BJP might return to power in India, but with a thin majority.

Moeed Yusuf, associate vice president of the United States Institute of Peace, said six months were enough for the Modi-led BJP to cash in on the anti-Pakistan rhetoric as well as some domestic issues and it would likely return to power.

The panelists were of the view that India would eventually have to hold talks with Pakistan as there was no other option. They said that whichever party formed the government after this year’s elections in India, it would resume dialogue with Pakistan.

",2019-01-13,"LAHORE: The Supreme Court on Saturday directed the federal and the provincial governments to pay compensation within one month to the people who suffered losses during religious parties’ violent protests following acquittal of Aasia Bibi in a blasphemy case.

A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar was hearing a suo motu case at the Lahore registry regarding losses and damage to life and property during a three-day long countrywide protest by religious parties led by the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after the apex court had acquitted Aasia Bibi.

The law officers of the provinces and officials of the Punjab home department appeared before the bench.

A Punjab law officer told the bench that the government assessed the value of the losses up to Rs262 million.

He said the provincial cabinet had approved a plan for the payment of the compensation to the affected people and the matter had been forwarded to the chief minister for the release of the funds.

Chief Justice Nisar regretted that had the court not taken notice of the people’s sufferings, the government would have been still making its plans. He said over two and a half months passed but a complete plan regarding compensation packages had not been submitted.

A section officer of the home department said the compensation would be paid to people within a month.

The bench disposed of the matter and directed the federal and the provincial governments to pay compensation to the victims within one month and submit a compliance report with the registrar of the court.

",2019-01-13,"HYDERABAD: Accusing the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government in Sindh of being “biased and racist”, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Saturday announced the holding of its public meeting here on Jan 18. It warned that if ever Sindh was divided, PPP’s “biased and racial policies” would be responsible for it.

Speaking at a press conference held at the party’s district office, MQM-P deputy convener MNA Kanwar Naveed Jamil recalled that it was PPP that had introduced the quota system in 1970s to divide urban and rural population.

He said MQM always adopted the culture of Sindh, and added that it was he who, as the Hyderabad district nazim, had named a flyover after Hosh Mohammad Sheedi and got Sindh’s cultural heritage preserved. A monument of Sheedi was also built.

MNA Jamil said that a road network had been laid during the district government system but between 2010 and 2018, PPP government neglected Karachi and Hyderabad and the present destruction of Hyderabad city was reflective of its “biased” policies.

He said it was criminal negligence of the government that people of Hyderabad were facing all kinds of problems today.

He noted that strongholds of MQM were hit by insanitation, collapsed sewerage system, broken roads and unending loadshedding of gas and electricity. He said despite MQM’s best efforts and announcement for a general university in Hyderabad, PPP was demonstrating slackness in its establishment.

Mr Jamil claimed that PPP government stopped funds for the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) to paralyse it; the trauma centre in the city was closed and its machinery was shifted somewhere else; a housing scheme was launched by the district government but the money of its allottees was utilised somewhere else; and child, cardiac and kidney care hospitals were approved but they were shifted to some other places.

He said PPP punished people of Hyderabad for electing MQM-P, adding that MQM-P was tolerating all kinds of excesses by the present Sindh government.

In order to raise people’s grievances, MQM-P had convened a public meeting in the city on Jan 18.

Mr Jamil said that his party supported across the board accountability and demanded that those who had looted the national wealth be brought to justice. He said according to an estimate, the country’s Rs94,000bn had been shifted abroad.

He said MQM-P had some grievances against the federal government but currently it had no option other than remaining with the PTI government.

Then federal minister for ports and shipping Babar Ghauri, the then KPT chairmen Javed Hanif, Rauf Akhtar Faroo­qui along with Mohammad Iqbal, Mohammad Sapa­ras, Mehmood Sharif, Ameer Ali Brohi and another have been accused of committing corruption through illegal regularisation of 940 employees of the KPT.

",2019-01-13,"KARACHI: Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) on Saturday stated that it was “extremely concerned” over the “unacceptable” increase in the prices of medicines by the federal government.

“The announcement of 15 per cent hike in medicine prices by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan with the consent of the federal government is highly disappointing and unacceptable,” said Dr S.M. Qaisar Sajjad, secretary general of the PMA, in a statement issued here.

“It is very distressing that instead of providing any relief to the people, the government had increased drug prices despite the fact that the older prices were already unaffordable,” he said.

He added that the painful aspect of the issue was that prices of lifesaving drugs had also been increased.

“In such a situation when there is scarcity of health facilities at public hospitals, this increase in medicine prices will add to the miseries of people.”

Dr Sajjad said half of the country’s population lived below the poverty line and they went to public hospitals for medical treatment.

“The conditions in the public hospitals are very poor. It is responsibility of the government to improve these facilities; and it should provide free medicines to all the patients coming to the government hospitals.”

The PMA official suggested that the government should consider some other ways to minimise the impact of the increased prices of medicines because of devaluation of the rupee.

“It could be done by supporting pharmaceutical companies through reducing taxes and cut in import duty of the raw material for drugs manufacturing and packaging. Vaccines and raw material for medicines should be produced in the country. Fake, counterfeit drugs and medicines’ smuggling should be eliminated on a priority basis.”

The PMA demanded that the federal government review its decision and withdraw the notification regarding the increase in drug prices to lessen difficulties of poor people who were already suffering because of the irrepressible inflation and bad economic situation in the country.

",2019-01-13,"KARACHI: The administrative judge of the antiterrorism courts on Saturday remanded five suspects, said to be involved in an attack on the Chinese consulate general in Karachi last year, in police custody in explosives and illicit weapons cases.

The investigating officer, Nusrat Shaikh, produced the suspects — Ahmed Hussain, Nadir Khan alias Baladi, Ali Ahmed alias Hashim, Abdul Latif and Mohammad Aslam — before the judge and submitted that they were arrested during a raid in Sadiq Baloch Goth, Taiser Town, and explosive substances as well as unlicensed weapons were found in their possession.

The IO submitted that the suspects were required for questioning as the police had to arrest their absconding accomplices and trace their criminal record since they were also involved in some other cases.

Police filed an ‘A-class’ report last month stating that suspects in Chinese CG case are not traceable

The administrative judge handed over the suspects to the police on five-day physical remand and directed the IO to produce them again on the next date along with a progress report.

A main case was registered against the suspects under Sections 4/5 of Explosive Substances Act, 1908 read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at the Gulshan-i-Maymar police station. They were also booked in four connected cases under Section 21(i)(a) of Sindh Arms Act, 2013.

The remand papers were silent about their alleged involvement in the Chinese CG attack and their affiliation with any banned militant outfit.

It was mentioned in the FIRs that police conducted a raid on a tip-off that the accomplices of the militants who attacked the Chinese CG were planning to carry out more attacks.

However, the Karachi police chief had told a press conference on Friday that the held suspects facilitated the militants who stormed the Chinese mission in Karachi and were associated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).

Three heavily armed militants carried out the gun-and-grenade attack on the consulate in a high-security zone of Clifton on Nov 23, 2018 in which two policemen and two visa applicants (father and son) were killed before the suspects were gunned down.

",2019-01-13,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Saturday directed the authorities concerned to continue the ongoing anti-encroachment drive in the city.

Justice Gulzar Ahmed of the SC presided over a meeting at the apex court’s Karachi registry about encroachments. The meeting was attended by officials of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Karachi Development Authority, Sindh Building Control Authority, Pakistan Railways, cantonment boards and others. Progress reports were submitted to the court.

Sources said that the apex court judge directed the authorities to remove encroachments from the city’s parks within a week, stop the charity organisations from using footpaths for food distribution, demolish a wall illegally built near a shopping mall in Clifton and remove illegal parking lots around restaurants and residential buildings as well as commercial activities on military land.

Justice Ahmed also directed the Railways to continue its operation against encroachments to revive the Karachi Railway Circular, they added.

After the meeting, Metropolitan Commissioner Saif-ur-Rehman told reporters that the apex court also ordered removal of the nurseries from footpaths and green belts of the city. He contended that the KMC had so far removed around 90 per cent encroachments in the provincial metropolis.

",2019-01-13,"KARACHI: Retailers have pushed up prices of essential food items including sugar and vegetables prices ahead of the mini-budget which will be announced on Jan 23.

Sugar now costs Rs60 per kg versus Rs55 per kg a few days ago following an increase in the wholesale price to Rs57-58 per kg from Rs55 per kg. Two months ago, the wholesale price of sugar was Rs52-53 per kg.

Retailers with old stocks of sweetener are now taking full advantage of the fresh price hike in wholesale markets and are demanding Rs5 per kg more from consumers.

Talking to Dawn, Patron-in-Chief Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA) Anis Majeed said the issue of late cane crushing and reports of low sugarcane crop can be blamed for the recent price hike.

The price may remain under pressure as a number of mills have yet to start cane crushing over price dispute, he said. However, he ruled out any shortage of sugar in the wholesale market.

Mr Majeed feared further price shocks in case the government raises import duties on raw materials and finished items in the mini budget.

Pakistan’s sugar exports plunged to 182,142 tonnes ($55.5 million) in 5MFY19 from 320,593 tonnes ($129m) in same period last year. In FY18, sugar exports swelled to $1.469m tonnes ($508m) from 307,348 tonnes ($161m) in FY17. Sugar production fell by seven per cent to 6.565m tonnes in FY18 from 7.048m tonnes in FY17.

Pricey tea whiteners, colas

The price of Nestle tea whitener 950 gram pack went up to Rs865 from Rs825 while 375 grams pack now costs Rs425 as against Rs400. The company did not mention any reason of price rise in a letter issued to retailers.

Despite the ongoing winter season, soft drink manufacturers have also increased the prices of beverages.

The price of one litre and 1.5 litre cola bottles produced by two main beverage makers surged by Rs5 per bottle, followed by Rs 10 increase for jumbo bottles.

Vegetables become expensive

Not to be left out, vegetable retailers are making huge windfalls by charging over 100 per cent profit from consumers on wholesale rates.

The retail price of onion is now Rs 30 per kgm from Rs 25 per kg earlier on. In Sabzi Mandi, wholesale price of onion hovers between Rs10-15 per kg.

The same situation exists for potato. The retail price of the root vegetable has been raised to Rs30 per kg from Rs20 per kg, while its wholesale price hovers between Rs10-12 per kg.

Tomato can be purchased at Rs40 per kg which was selling at Rs 20-30 per kg. Its wholesale price is Rs 20-25 per kg.

President Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market New Sabzi Mandi Super Highway Haji Shahjehan said retailers are depriving consumers from taking benefit of low rates of Sindh’s onion and tomato crop and Punjab’s potato crop.

Transportation charges have definitely increased due to Rs23 per kg hike in CNG rates coupled with diesel and LPG prices which have pushed up the cost of living for everyone, he said.

Cucumber and turrai now sell at Rs80 per kg which were priced Rs40-50 per kg. Lokki and tinday are now available at Rs60 and Rs80 per kg as against Rs40 per kg each few days back. Shimla mirch (capsicum) prices moved up to Rs80 from Rs60 per kg. Bhindi (lady finger) is available at Rs120 as against Rs80 per kg.

A retailer said tomato prices are rising as the vegetable could not ripe due to low temperatures. As a result, unripe tomatoes are being sold in the market in larger quantities.

",2019-01-13,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) has rejected the government’s plan to unveil a mini-budget later this month.

Parliamentary leader of the PPP in the Senate Sherry Rehman in a statement expressed her reservations over the ever-increasing price hike and government’s plans to introduce a mini-budget to make lives of the common man more miserable.

Strongly opposing the plan, Ms Rehman asked if the government which was determined to bring about a revolution would introduce mini-budgets every four months. She advised the government to prepare for the annual budget, saying that this was not the time to unveil a mini-budget.

She observed that the mini- budget was being unveiled to meet the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “We strongly oppose the decision,” she said. Ms Rehman regretted that the government continued to levy new taxes and increase the prices of one or the other commodity every month.

She regretted that just a day after increase in the prices of drugs, the government announced its plans about unveiling a mini-budget. “The tsunami of change has turned into a price hike tornado,” she remarked and pointed out that the rate of inflation which stood at 5.8 per cent had gone up to 6.2pc while the growth rate had substantially gone down. Ms Rehman said that those who talked of business-friendly policies had devastated businesses. She said the government had no direction and had failed to efficiently run the economy.

The PPP leader said that the government had done nothing except chanting slogans of accountability and setting the economy aright.

Talking to Dawn, she said that the economy appeared to be in shambles while ‘accountability’ was merely being used as a tool against political opponents. She said that the opposition demanded that the government reverse its policy of witch-hunt and stop taking steps that added to the problems being faced by the people.

",2019-01-13,"GILGIT: Despite continuous snowfall and harsh temperatures, three foreign expeditions have entered decisive stages in the quest to scale the most challenging peaks of K2 and Nanga Parbat.

A foreign expedition team, comprising Daniele Nardi from Italy with Britain’s Thomas Ballard and two Pakistanis Rehmatullah Baig and Karim Hayat, are currently attempting to develop a new route on Mummery Spur to scale Nanga Parbat. They reached camp 3 at 5,714 metres through a new route on Saturday. The team had started the expedition on Dec 24, 2018.

Daniel Nardi, the team leader, through a satellite phone informed Dawn that the deteriorating weather conditions at Nanga Parbat had caused hurdles to progress.

He said that the team had scaled to camp 3 but heavy snowfall and speedy winds had forced it to descend back to the base camp. The team would continue its expedition as soon as the weather conditions improved, he added.

Meanwhile, two other foreign expedition teams are en route to the K2 base camp. Climbers of these teams are from Russia, Kazak­hstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland and Spain and Nepali Sherpas.

One team is led by Vassiliy Pivtsov from Kazakhstan and Artem Brown from Rus­sia is their project organiser.

Elena Laletina, official secretary of the other team — Russian K2 expedition 2019 — said that the climbers were on their way to the K2 base camp. She said that they had left Urdukas on Saturday morning and the team would be at the base camp by next week. The team has planned to attempt K2 through the Abruzzi Spur route.

Famous mountaineer Karim Shah Nizari told Dawn that it was very challenging to climb K2 and Nanga Parbat in winter through the Mummery Spur route. He said that the success of the expedition teams seemed difficult.

Both teams, he said, had already lost important days of the season and the weather conditions did not seem to be suitable for completion of the expeditions on time.

182,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457172/govt-asked-to-withdraw-hike-in-prices-of-medicines,"Govt asked to withdraw hike in prices of medicines
",2019-01-13,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and some of the stakeholders of the health sector have criticised a sudden increase in prices of various medicines and urged the government to withdraw the decision as middle and lower classes would suffer the most because of it.

Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, the spokesman for PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has said that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government is preying on the people by hiking the prices.

The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) on Friday had announced up to 15 per cent increase in prices of various medicines.

He said the constant increase in prices of goods was unacceptable and would not be tolerated. The government first snatched the calm of the people and was now snatching their lives by increasing the prices of medicines, he said.

“The government’s only performance has been taking from the people the facilities provided to them. In the guise of claims of providing people with five million houses, the government has only rendered people homeless,” Senator Khokhar said.

He said that the government’s conduct had been disappointing and it was only a matter of time that the people of Pakistan would start protesting against the injustice and biased attitude of the PTI rule. The government had proven itself to be a destructive tsunami, he concluded.

Secretary General of the Pakistan Medical Association Dr Qaisar Sajjad has stated that the association was very much concerned over the hike in medicine prices.

“The government should find other ways to minimise the effect of increasing the cost of medicines because of the rupee’s devaluation. It could be done by supporting pharmaceutical companies by reducing taxes and duty on import of raw materials for manufacturing drugs. Vaccines and raw materials should be produced locally. Fake and counterfeit drugs and smuggling of medicines should be eliminated on a priority basis,” Dr Sajjad said.

Pakistan Islamic Medical Association’s president Prof Afzal Mian said the rising inflation had exposed the government’s inability to plan for welfare of the nation. Even if the excuse of devaluation was accepted, it is deplorable that the crunch was yet again transferred to the people who were struggling to survive, he added.

However, Pharma Bureau’s Executive Director Ayesha Tammy Haq while talking to Dawn said that the increase was not sufficient as most of the medicine prices were increased by 9pc while the rupee was devalued by over 30pc.

“Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar had also directed the government and Drap to increase the prices of medicines, considering the hike in the dollar’s value and finally it has been done,” she said.

Ms Haq said that although the increase was not sufficient it would help the pharmaceutical companies to survive. “We expect that the prices will be further increased at the end of the financial year, considering the Consumer Price Index,” she said.

In reply to a question, she said that the government could have reduced the taxes rather than passing the burden to patients, but it did not go for that option.

",2019-01-13,"LAHORE: Punjab Minister for Health Dr Yasmin Rashid on Saturday told the Supreme Court that the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute (PKLI) would start conducting paediatric liver transplant within six months.

The minister also informed a two-judge SC bench that the Punjab cabinet had approved a draft legislation to abolish the trust of the PKLI which would be run by the government through a board of governors (BoG) after its approval by the chief minister and the provincial assembly.

The bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, was hearing a matter regarding alleged irregularities at the PKLI and any possibility to conduct paediatric liver transplant at it.

Punjab cabinet approves draft legislation to abolish the institute’s trust and take over its management, says health minister

Dr Rashid said she along with the chief minister had recently visited the PKLI and had a detailed meeting with doctors over there. She said the doctors assured the government that the institute would be able to hold the first-ever paediatric liver transplant in the public sector by June.

Advocate Zafar Iqbal Kalanuri, however, raised objection to the composition of the BoG and said the government wanted to appoint certain officials at the institute to take control of its affairs.

However, the minister dispelled the impression and assured the court that no official from the previous government would be made part of the BoG.

At the hearing, the chief justice also took notice of a negative propaganda campaign being run in government circles against Dr Rashid in the light of harsh remarks of the court regarding her working. He said the remarks had been misconstrued.

“I was personally very happy when you were given the portfolio of health,” Chief Justice Nisar told

Dr Rashid and added that it was his wish to see a practising doctor run the health ministry.

CJP says he won’t let minister resign

The minister said the opposition parties in the provincial assembly had also demanded her resignation.

“You need not to be worried about criticism. Look at me, who else can face criticism more than I experienced,” CJP Nisar said while giving her assurance that he would not let her resign.

Meanwhile, Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Director General Hussain Asghar submitted an inquiry report about the institute.

He said the project, which was supposed to be completed by December 2017, was still under construction. He said no action had been taken against the contractors for delaying the project.

He said some government officials were involved in misappropriation of funds and a detailed investigation could be held after registration of a case against them.

Representing the previous management of the institute, Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan objected to the fairness of the report. He said the ACE report was mainly based on a forensic audit report that itself carried grave factual mistakes.

He also requested the bench to stop the ACE from registration of an FIR till the submission of a reply to the report. “The FIR carries a big stigma,” he added.

The bench did not pass any restraining order to this effect but directed the ACE not to cause any illegal arrest in the case. The court also asked Barrister Ahsan and other counsel of the PKLI’s old management to submit their replies on the report by Jan 16.

Next hearing will be held at Islamabad.

",2019-01-13,"KOTRI: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has vowed to fight the “politics of vendetta” saying he is not afraid of threats of the exit control list, National Accountability Bureau and imprisonment.

Addressing a public meeting here on Saturday after inaugurating Kotri-Jamshoro overhead bridge, he said the PPP had faced “Gen Zia’s lashes and Gen Musharraf’s prisons and exile” and it was not afraid of the incumbent “puppet and benami prime minister”.

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, PPP provincial president Nisar Khuhro and MPA Malik Asad Sikandar also spoke on the occasion.

PPP leader warns PTI govt against testing patience of jiyalas

Mr Bhutto-Zardari said if the people of Sindh, Balochistan, southern Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa decided to “take on Islamabad” to secure their rights and protest against deprivation, it would prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the “fake government”.

He warned the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government against testing patience of PPP jiyalas, saying if it didn’t refrain from it, the PPP would show it how “theft of vote” was avenged.

He said the PPP preferred service delivery like construction of bridges over the River Indus, canal lining, road networks, subsidy to farmers and provision of employment in Thar and quality cardiac care services.

He said the “selected prime minister” and the Punjab chief minister could not compete with the Sindh chief minister.

“Your plan to oust us through conspiracies has failed and you will fail again,” he said while addressing PM Imran Khan.

He said an inept federal government was meting out step-motherly treatment to the people of Sindh who were being punished for voting for the PPP.

He said Imran Khan needed to learn principles of politics before talking about principled politics and added that the finger of umpire worked in cricket and the people’s will in politics.

He accused the PTI of making false promises and fraudulent claims and said Pakistan was heading backwards under its government. “The national economy remains weak and people are drowning in the tsunami of price hike while mills and shops are being closed.”

The PPP leader said poor people didn’t have two square meals a day because their sources of livelihood had been snatched.

He said those who talked about providing 10 million jobs and five million houses to people had snatched from them already available job opportunities and deprived them of shelter.

“Pakistan does not have electricity, gas and investment but the federal ministers are claiming there is no price hike and advising people to be patient. The eyes of the ministers are closed with arrogance and minds intoxicated with power while their hearts are insensitive”, he said.

Mr Bhutto-Zardari accused the government of closing water and electricity supplies to Sindh which contributed 80pc of gas produced in Pakistan.

He said billions of rupees of the Sindh government had been withheld which badly affected development process.

He asked for what crime the people of Sindh were being pushed against wall and then answered his question, saying because they did not vote for “puppets” and were loyal to the Bhuttos.

He said the government didn’t know how the rupee got devalued and the wheels of economy got jammed although it claimed to be working faster than light’s speed.

“The government doesn’t know how the debt of Rs5bn has increased but those who said they preferred suicide over the begging bowl are now celebrating foreign borrowings”.

Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the federal government had tried to commit robbery over the mandate of Sindh in just three months but got only disappointment and shelved the plan.

CM Shah said the Kotri-Jamshoro bridge had been completed in a record period of time and urged Mr Bhutto-Zardari to take up the issue of dualisation of Indus Highway between Jamshoro and Sehwan in the National Assembly.

Earlier, Mr Bilawal-Bhutto visited residence of Asad Sikandar during which shops of the area were closed by the administration. He also took tea at the residence of MPA Hina Dastagir.

185,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457176/cjps-order-termed-void-days-before-his-retirement,"CJP’s order termed void days before his retirement
",2019-01-13,"ISLAMABAD: Another judge of the Supreme Court has declared the order of Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, who is going to doff his robes on January 17, about reconstituting a bench of the Peshawar registry in the middle of a hearing void and non-est.

In the absence of any recusal from any member of the bench, the reconstitution of a smaller bench by removing a judge (Justice Qazi Faez Isa), who had questioned the exercise of suo motu powers, would amount to stifling the independent view of the judge that could shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in a six-page strongly worded order.

He said his order be read into other cases fixed before the three-member bench on that day and which were again fixed before the reconstituted two-member bench. “All those cases are to be put up for rehearing before an appropriate bench again to be constituted by the chief justice and record of the court must reflect the correct status of these cases,” the order stated.

Judge’s removal from SC bench after he questioned legality of suo motu proceedings amounts to shaking the foundation of impartial justice system, observes Justice Mansoor Ali Shah

Justice Shah agreed with the viewpoint expressed by Justice Isa who had raised objection to the reconstituting of the smaller bench whilst hearing the case in March 2018. The bench comprising Justice Isa, Justice Shah and CJP Nisar was reconstituted after Justice Isa questioned the legality of the proceedings related to hospital waste. Justice Isa was excluded from the reconstituted bench that comprised Justice Shah and the CJP.

In a separate note, Justice Isa had objected to the exercise of Article 184(3) of the Constitution by holding that before exercising its original jurisdiction, the SC must satisfy itself that the jurisdiction it is assuming accords with the Constitution. Justice Isa had also held that he was constrained to write this, since not doing so would weigh heavily on his conscience and he would be abdicating his responsibility as a judge.

Now Justice Shah in a separate note admitted that his sitting on the reconstituted two-member bench was a mistake and having realised that after examining the legal position, he did not sign the orders passed by the reconstituted bench but as a junior member of the bench, awaited for the CJP to pass an appropriate order in response to the reaction of Justice Isa. He waited for the appropriate order by the CJP to respond to the note of Justice Isa by explaining the reasons of the reconstitution of the smaller bench on that day, Justice Shah observed. But no such order was passed till date and the case had been incorrectly reflected in the bench disposal statement as an adjourned case, Justice Shah recalled.

“The chief justice is retiring on Jan 17, therefore, I feel constitutionally obligated, as a member of the bench, to express my views regarding the order of brother [Justice Isa] and to pass my order in this case for May 19, 2018 when it came up for hearing before the bench.”

In his opinion, Justice Shah explained, a bench once constituted and is seized of a matter on the judicial side, cannot be reconstituted by the chief justice in exercise of his administrative powers, unless a member of the bench withdrew himself from the bench.

Thus the reconstitution of the bench on that day was unwarranted and unprecedented and undermined the integrity of the judicial system, wrote Justice Shah.

In the absence of a recusal by a member of the bench, Justice Shah observed, any amount of disagreement amongst members of the bench on an issue before them, could not form a valid ground for reconstitution of the bench. And any reconstitution of the bench on this ground would impinge on the constitutional value of independence of the judiciary, he added.

“The construct of judicial system is pillared on the assumption that every judge besides being fair and impartial is fiercely independent and is free to uphold his judicial view,” Justice Shah said, adding this judicial freedom was foundational to the concept of rule of law. Thus the reconstitution of the bench while hearing the case, in the absence of any recusal from any member on the bench or due to any other reason, would amount to stifling the independent view of the judge and any effort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an alternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, he feared.

“This erodes the public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands,” he stated. Public confidence was the most precious asset that this branch of the state (judiciary) had, Justice Shah stated, adding it was also one of the most precious assets of the nation.

Citing from international jurisdictions, Justice Shah recalled how Prof Ahraon Barack pointed out that a judge ought to be aware of his power and the limits thereof. “Naturally, the judge knows the law and the power it grants to the judge, but he must also learn the limits imposed on him as a judge.”

Also, a judge must recognise his mistakes, Justice Shah said, adding that like all mortals judges erred but a judge must admit this.

While quoting Justice Jackson’s statement “we are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final”, Justice Shah stated: “I think the learned judge erred. The finality of our decision is based on our ability to admit our mistakes and our willingness to do so in appropriate cases.”

Justice Shah also cited ‘The Charter of Rights and Freedom: A Judicial Perspective’ in which McLachlim Beverly noted that if judges admitted their mistakes they would strengthen public confidence in the judiciary. Besides, he said, in writing and thinking, judges must “display modesty and an absence of arrogance”. Statements such as those of Chief Justice Hughes that “we are under the Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is” are not merely incorrect but also perniciously arrogant, Justice Shah observed.

He said his order be read into other cases fixed before the three-member bench on that day and which were again fixed before the reconstituted two-member bench. “All those cases are to be put up for rehearing before an appropriate bench again to be constituted by the chief justice and record of the court must reflect the correct status of these cases,” the order said.

The prisoner was brought to JPMC on January 5 and got admitted in the general ward from where he managed to escape early Friday morning (Jan 11) despite the presence of the court police, said JPMC Executive Director Dr Seemin Jamali.

The suspect had gunshot wounds on his leg which was previously operated upon. He was admitted again to undergo surgery as he felt difficulty in walking, added Dr Jamali.

",2019-01-12,"Pakistan Rangers Sindh on Saturday announced to have arrested a suspected gangster from Karachi, who is said to be wanted in “25 heinous crimes of killings, attacks on law enforcers, extortion, kidnappings, and others”.

The paramilitary force conducted an intelligence-based operation in Ali Mohammed Mohalla of Lyari and apprehended Shahzad alias Mohammed Azeem alias Faizu Dada who was associated with Ghaffar Zikri gang.

Ghaffar Zikri was gunned down along with his minor son in an encounter jointly carried out by police and Intelligence Bureau in Lyari last year.

The Rangers spokesperson said the held suspect was wanted in targeted killings, attacks on state institutions and extortion, and there were at least 25 FIRs registered against him. Moreover, the Sindh government had also announced a reward of Rs0.3 million for his arrest.

Attacks on law enforcers

Sharing details of the crimes allegedly committed by the suspect, the spokesperson said Shahzad along with his accomplices carried out at least 11 attacks on the policemen during 2007 and 2008, in which three innocent citizens were also killed during an exchange of fire.

He also gunned down one Kareem Shah over non-payment of extortion in 2009, besides killing a Baloch person on directions of Ghaffar Zikri in the same year, the official said.

“In 2011, he shot dead an alleged drug peddler, Shah Jehan. Later that year, he along with his accomplices kidnapped a member of Kutchi Rabita Committee, Jamshed, and killed him.

189,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457116/justice-nisar-suspends-execution-of-mentally-ill-prisoner-khizar-hayat,"Justice Nisar suspends execution of mentally ill prisoner Khizar Hayat
",2019-01-12,"Chief Justice Saqib Nisar on Saturday took notice of media reports regarding the scheduled execution of Khizer Hayat, a mentally ill prisoner on death row, and announced to suspend his sentence till further orders.

Moreover, the chief justice also fixed the matter for hearing on Monday [January 14], read a statement issued by the Supreme Court.

Earlier in the day, Hayat's mother Iqbal Bano had moved the court calling for the suspension of his death sentence on the grounds of mental illness.

On Friday, a district and sessions judge in Lahore had scheduled the execution of Hayat — a death-row prisoner diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia — for January 15 at the central jail in Kot Lakhpat.

The request filed by Hayat's mother, which was submitted before the court's human rights cell, was reviewed by Chief Justice Nisar. The petition called for the Supreme Court's attention to the fact that a mentally ill prisoner was being sentenced to death.

It has stated that the judgment passed by Lahore High Court ""is not in accordance with law and the Prison Rules"".

The petition has also argued that the court has ""mixed the conviction with execution and thereby has dismissed the writ petition on wrong premises"".

It further argued that neither the medical history of the petitioner's son has been taken into account and nor have the medical board's reports been considered which establish the prisoner's ailment.

The petition notes that ""the extensive jail medical records establishing the mental ailment of the condemned prisoner are sufficient to withhold the execution of death sentence till the time the condemned prisoner is fully recovered from the ailment"".

Moreover, the petition has also stated: ""There is no way that Khizar Hayat’s execution can be carried out in a manner that complies with Pakistan’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the UN Convention against Torture.""

Hayat was sentenced to death in 2003 over the shooting of a fellow police officer. He has spent nearly 15 years on death row. He was first diagnosed as a schizophrenic in 2008 by jail medical authorities. In 2010, the jail medical officer recommended that Hayat needed specialised treatment and should be shifted to the psychiatric facility. However, this was never done.

In 2017, the Lahore High Court had stayed the execution of Hayat.

On Monday, a two-member bench comprising Justice Manzoor Ahmad Malik and Justice Sardar Tariq Masoof will hear the case.

Hayat's mother, in a letter, requested the chief justice to visit Kot Lakhpat jail's ward for mentally ill prisoners and investigate what medicines were being given to her son.

She pleaded that his medical records be investigated ""to determine why his treatment was not being done properly and why his condition was worsening day by day"".

""I read in Dawn that a prisoner named Khizar Hayat has been sentenced to be hanged,"" the chief justice remarked, inquiring from the Punjab attorney general which jail Hayat was serving his sentence in. The official replied it was Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail.

Justice Nisar asked that it be immediately ascertained if Hayat has been diagnosed as mentally ill and sought a report today.

Meanwhile, Justice Project Pakistan (JPP), which has been contesting the case, has been running a campaign on social media, asking President Arif Alvi to ""grant mercy"" to Hayat. According to Article 45 of the Constitution, the president has the ""power to grant pardon, reprieve and respite, and to remit, suspend or commute any sentence passed by any court, tribunal or other authority"".

Earlier on Saturday, a press conference was organised by the Pakistan Psychiatric Society to call to attention the prisoner's execution.

""All medical officers who have examined Khizar Hayat over the years have found him to be actively exhibiting schizophrenic symptoms,"" said Dr Usman Ahmad Hotiana of the Pakistan Psychiatric Society. ""In 2009, Khizar's mental illness got so severe that he got horribly beaten by his fellow prisoners. His injuries were severe enough to require surgeries. After that, he was put in solitary confinement.""",Rana Bilal,"['chief', 'justice', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'saturday', 'took', 'notice', 'media', 'reports', 'regarding', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'khizer', 'hayat', 'mentally', 'ill', 'prisoner', 'death', 'row', 'announced', 'suspend', 'sentence', 'till', 'orders', 'moreover', 'chief', 'justice', 'also', 'fixed', 'matter', 'hearing', 'monday', 'january', '14', 'read', 'statement', 'issued', 'supreme', 'court', 'earlier', 'day', 'hayat', 'mother', 'iqbal', 'bano', 'moved', 'court', 'calling', 'suspension', 'death', 'sentence', 'grounds', 'mental', 'illness', 'friday', 'district', 'sessions', 'judge', 'lahore', 'scheduled', 'execution', 'hayat', 'deathrow', 'prisoner', 'diagnosed', 'paranoid', 'schizophrenia', 'january', '15', 'central', 'jail', 'kot', 'lakhpat', 'request', 'filed', 'hayat', 'mother', 'submitted', 'court', 'human', 'rights', 'cell', 'reviewed', 'chief', 'justice', 'nisar', 'petition', 'called', 'supreme', 'court', 'attention', 'fact', 'mentally', 'ill', 'prisoner', 'sentenced', 'death', 'stated', 'judgment', 'passed', 'lahore', 'high', 'court', 'accordance', 'law', 'prison', 'rules', 'petition', 'also', 'argued', 'court', 'mixed', 'conviction', 'execution', 'thereby', 'dismissed', 'writ', 'petition', 'wrong', 'premises', 'argued', 'neither', 'medical', 'history', 'petitioner', 'son', 'taken', 'account', 'medical', 'board', 'reports', 'considered', 'establish', 'prisoner', 'ailment', 'petition', 'notes', 'extensive', 'jail', 'medical', 'records', 'establishing', 'mental', 'ailment', 'condemned', 'prisoner', 'sufficient', 'withhold', 'execution', 'death', 'sentence', 'till', 'time', 'condemned', 'prisoner', 'fully', 'recovered', 'ailment', 'moreover', 'petition', 'also', 'stated', 'way', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'execution', 'carried', 'manner', 'complies', 'pakistan', 'obligations', 'international', 'covenant', 'civil', 'political', 'rights', 'un', 'convention', 'torture', 'hayat', 'sentenced', 'death', '2003', 'shooting', 'fellow', 'police', 'officer', 'spent', 'nearly', '15', 'years', 'death', 'row', 'first', 'diagnosed', 'schizophrenic', '2008', 'jail', 'medical', 'authorities', '2010', 'jail', 'medical', 'officer', 'recommended', 'hayat', 'needed', 'specialised', 'treatment', 'shifted', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'however', 'never', 'done', '2017', 'lahore', 'high', 'court', 'stayed', 'execution', 'hayat', 'monday', 'twomember', 'bench', 'comprising', 'justice', 'manzoor', 'ahmad', 'malik', 'justice', 'sardar', 'tariq', 'masoof', 'hear', 'case', 'hayat', 'mother', 'letter', 'requested', 'chief', 'justice', 'visit', 'kot', 'lakhpat', 'jail', 'ward', 'mentally', 'ill', 'prisoners', 'investigate', 'medicines', 'given', 'son', 'pleaded', 'medical', 'records', 'investigated', 'determine', 'treatment', 'done', 'properly', 'condition', 'worsening', 'day', 'day', 'read', 'dawn', 'prisoner', 'named', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'sentenced', 'hanged', 'chief', 'justice', 'remarked', 'inquiring', 'punjab', 'attorney', 'general', 'jail', 'hayat', 'serving', 'sentence', 'official', 'replied', 'lahore', 'kot', 'lakhpat', 'jail', 'justice', 'nisar', 'asked', 'immediately', 'ascertained', 'hayat', 'diagnosed', 'mentally', 'ill', 'sought', 'report', 'today', 'meanwhile', 'justice', 'project', 'pakistan', 'jpp', 'contesting', 'case', 'running', 'campaign', 'social', 'media', 'asking', 'president', 'arif', 'alvi', 'grant', 'mercy', 'hayat', 'according', 'article', '45', 'constitution', 'president', 'power', 'grant', 'pardon', 'reprieve', 'respite', 'remit', 'suspend', 'commute', 'sentence', 'passed', 'court', 'tribunal', 'authority', 'earlier', 'saturday', 'press', 'conference', 'organised', 'pakistan', 'psychiatric', 'society', 'call', 'attention', 'prisoner', 'execution', 'medical', 'officers', 'examined', 'khizar', 'hayat', 'years', 'found', 'actively', 'exhibiting', 'schizophrenic', 'symptoms', 'said', 'dr', 'usman', 'ahmad', 'hotiana', 'pakistan', 'psychiatric', 'society', '2009', 'khizar', 'mental', 'illness', 'got', 'severe', 'got', 'horribly', 'beaten', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'injuries', 'severe', 'enough', 'require', 'surgeries', 'put', 'solitary', 'confinement']","['justice', 'nisar', 'suspends', 'execution', 'mentally', 'ill', 'prisoner', 'khizar', 'hayat']"

",2019-01-12,"The second edition of the National Academy of Performing Arts’ (Napa) Laughter Fest began on Thursday night with a play titled Haye Muhabbat.

To be honest, it was not a bad effort. It had its moments. But one is not sure if it was worthy enough to start an 11-day-long festival with.

The tightrope that a theatre director walks in putting together a dialogue-driven drama is to know at what stage or till what time the use of funny words –– innuendo, repartee, punch line –– will become predictable for the audience. Mind you, the interest of those who had packed the Zia Mohyeddin auditorium on Thursday did not waver too much. Still, there were many a moment where ‘laughter’, the USP of the fest, appeared to be a rare commodity. And the actors hadn’t brought their A-game, either.

Written by Babar Jamal and directed by Uzma Sabeen, Haye Muhabbat tells the tale of Kashi (Samhan Ghazi), a forty-something man leading a loveless life. When the play begins he dials a number from his (landline) telephone (whose short handset cord was causing the actor trouble and a lapse in concentration) to try his luck one last time. He finds Neelofar (Zarqa Naz) at the other end. She is in her thirties and is also looking for someone to have a romantic relationship with. After a bit of a whacky conversation, they decide to meet at a restaurant. To his surprise, when he reaches the restaurant, he finds out that Neelofar has brought along her mother (Shumaila Taj). This gives away the mental state of Neelofar to Kashi, and instead of him following her, she starts to stalk him, trying to persuade him to get married to her.

Her dodgy intent is further highlighted when, while visiting his house for the first time, her mamoo (Hammad Khan) tags along to sort out some legal stuff. All of this drives Kashi up the wall. And yet, he can’t do anything about it. The girl is pushier than he initially thought she was.

Haye Muhabbat heavily relies on the conversations between its male and female protagonists. It works, although in patches. Zarqa Naz plays a talkative character. Unfortunately, her loquaciousness as Neelofar made her say her lines with such rapidity that it was often difficult to understand the tone of her voice. On the other hand, Shumaila Taj as her mother and therapist had a voice-projection issue, which is strange, because both the girls have a reasonable wealth of experience as theatre artists.

One has mentioned this because one has seen all these individuals grow as artists in recent years. They are competent. But who can dodge a lean patch?

At this, the interior department's section officer assured the bench that payments will be made during the ongoing month.

The court ordered the provincial government to submit an implementation report after making payments within a month.

During the last hearing of the suo motu notice on loss of properties during violent protest against the release of Aasia Bibi, the apex court had directed the federal and provincial governments to submit their plans for the payment of compensation to those who lost their lives and properties during protests.

Justice Nisar had expr­e­ss­ed dissatisfaction over reports submitted by the governments of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa about the loss of lives and damage caused to private property by the protesters.

A Punjab law officer had told the bench that as many as 2,936 activists and their leaders had been detained. He said 503 cases were registered, including 26 under terrorism charges. He had added that the damage caused to public property had been estimated at Rs40.6 million.

The law officer said the damage to private property was estimated at Rs3.3m in the province.

The government should have invited the claims through newspaper advertisement, Justice Ijazul Ahsan had observed and said the report was not satisfactory, rather a faulty one.

An additional home secretary had told the bench that the matter of mode of compensation amount would soon be taken up by the provincial cabinet.

The Sindh IGP had told the bench that 342 protesters were arrested in 41 cases registered by the police. The report filed by the KP government showed that 62 people were arrested. It said the protesters had not caused any major damage to public and private property in the province. An officer from Islamabad said no incident of ransacking or damage was reported in the federal capital.",Rana Bilal,"['supreme', 'court', 'saturday', 'ordered', 'federal', 'provincial', 'governments', 'compensate', 'within', 'one', 'month', 'affectees', 'violent', 'protests', 'held', 'wake', 'release', 'aasia', 'bibi', 'christian', 'woman', 'previously', 'condemned', 'death', 'blasphemy', 'charges', 'twomember', 'bench', 'chief', 'justice', 'pakistan', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'stewardship', 'hearing', 'suo', 'motu', 'case', 'lahore', 'registry', 'read', '7', 'points', 'explain', 'supreme', 'court', 'decision', 'free', 'aasia', 'bibi', 'punjab', 'advocate', 'general', 'outset', 'hearing', 'told', 'court', 'losses', 'estimated', 'tune', 'rs262', 'million', 'adding', 'cabinet', 'approved', 'estimated', 'figure', 'submitted', 'reports', 'estimated', 'loss', 'time', 'frame', 'mode', 'payments', 'chief', 'justice', 'asked', 'devised', 'plan', 'merely', 'paperwork', 'justice', 'aijazul', 'ahsan', 'enquired', 'interior', 'department', 'section', 'officer', 'assured', 'bench', 'payments', 'made', 'ongoing', 'month', 'court', 'ordered', 'provincial', 'government', 'submit', 'implementation', 'report', 'making', 'payments', 'within', 'month', 'last', 'hearing', 'suo', 'motu', 'notice', 'loss', 'properties', 'violent', 'protest', 'release', 'aasia', 'bibi', 'apex', 'court', 'directed', 'federal', 'provincial', 'governments', 'submit', 'plans', 'payment', 'compensation', 'lost', 'lives', 'properties', 'protests', 'justice', 'nisar', 'expressed', 'dissatisfaction', 'reports', 'submitted', 'governments', 'punjab', 'sindh', 'khyber', 'pakhtunkhwa', 'loss', 'lives', 'damage', 'caused', 'private', 'property', 'protesters', 'punjab', 'law', 'officer', 'told', 'bench', 'many', '2936', 'activists', 'leaders', 'detained', 'said', '503', 'cases', 'registered', 'including', '26', 'terrorism', 'charges', 'added', 'damage', 'caused', 'public', 'property', 'estimated', 'rs406', 'million', 'law', 'officer', 'said', 'damage', 'private', 'property', 'estimated', 'rs33m', 'province', 'government', 'invited', 'claims', 'newspaper', 'advertisement', 'justice', 'ijazul', 'ahsan', 'observed', 'said', 'report', 'satisfactory', 'rather', 'faulty', 'one', 'additional', 'home', 'secretary', 'told', 'bench', 'matter', 'mode', 'compensation', 'amount', 'would', 'soon', 'taken', 'provincial', 'cabinet', 'sindh', 'igp', 'told', 'bench', '342', 'protesters', 'arrested', '41', 'cases', 'registered', 'police', 'report', 'filed', 'kp', 'government', 'showed', '62', 'people', 'arrested', 'said', 'protesters', 'caused', 'major', 'damage', 'public', 'private', 'property', 'province', 'officer', 'islamabad', 'said', 'incident', 'ransacking', 'damage', 'reported', 'federal', 'capital']","['aasia', 'bibi', 'protests', 'sc', 'directs', 'federal', 'provincial', 'govts', 'compensate', 'affectees', 'within', '30', 'days']"

",2019-01-12,"The federal government has decided not to enter an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme for now, Finance Minister Asad Umar said on Saturday.

The finance minister made the remarks while talking to businessmen at the Karachi Chamber of Commence and Industry (KCCI).

Umar said that instead of rushing into the IMF programme, the government was exploring alternative options.

Furthermore, the finance minister announced that the government will unveil a mini-budget on Jan 23 instead of Jan 21. He associated the two-day delay to an impending foreign trip of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The finance minister said that his visits of Lahore and Karachi were regarding a one-point agenda: the amended finance bill, which he said will facilitate businessmen.

Umar indicated that the amended bill will also carry ""some good news"" for the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) .

The minister said that he consulted all stakeholders over the upcoming mini-budget, assuring the assortment of businessmen that tax anomalies will be eliminated in the budget.

The minister rejected the impression that the government was only borrowing money, stressing that several agreements have also been signed to bring investment into the country.

""The impacts of the investment agreements will start surfacing from the next week,"" he added.

Asad Umar, even before he was sworn in, had said that the economy would need an infusion of more than $12 billion within six weeks.

In a later interview with Bloomberg, he had said that the nation’s financial gap was somewhere between $10bn to $12bn, adding that the new government would need a bit extra so it doesn’t “live on the edge”.

In October last year, Saudi Arabia had announced a $6 billion bailout package for Pakistan’s ailing economy. The package includes $3bn in balance of payments support and just as much in deferred payments on oil imports.

The UAE had also announced a package exactly the same size and terms and conditions as given by Saudi Arabia. The all-weather friend, China too, had pledged to lend $2 billion to Pakistan to shore up dwindling foreign exchange reserves.

Moreover, Islamabad and Riyadh are expected to ink memorandum of understanding (MoUs) to bring in Saudi investment in excess of $10bn this month. Pakistan is also eyeing similar MoUs with China, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia over the next two months.

The federal cabinet has also approved a strategy to issue so-called 'Panda bonds' in the Chinese market to raise foreign exchange from global markets.

'Budget bomb'

Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in a statement strongly opposed the government's upcoming mini-budget.

The party's vice president, Senator Sherry Rehman, expressed grave reservations against rising inflation and the government's announcement of the mini budget.

""Will this inquilab sarkar (revolutionary government) announce a new mini budget every four months?"" she asked.

She said that the government should make preparations for an annual budget and that this was not the time to announce a mini budget.

The PPP leader likened the decision to a ""budget bomb"" being dropped on the people, based on supposed conditions put forth by the IMF.

""Every month new taxes are being imposed and some commodity or the other sees a hike in prices.

""One day the prices of medicines go up and the next, a mini budget is announced,"" Rehman said adding that the government is ""robbing the people of the right to live"".

She said that the ""tsunami of change"" had now transformed into a ""storm of inflation"".

Rehman recalled that inflation stood at 5.8 per cent in July, whereas now it had gone up to 6.2pc.

She said that those who claimed being ""friends of businessmen"" are in fact their enemies and declared that the government is incapable of running the economy.

The PPP leader further criticising the government's performance said that in the past five months, they had ""done nothing but raise slogans for economy and accountability"".",Talqeen Zubairi,"['federal', 'government', 'decided', 'enter', 'international', 'monetary', 'fund', 'imf', 'programme', 'finance', 'minister', 'asad', 'umar', 'said', 'saturday', 'finance', 'minister', 'made', 'remarks', 'talking', 'businessmen', 'karachi', 'chamber', 'commence', 'industry', 'kcci', 'umar', 'said', 'instead', 'rushing', 'imf', 'programme', 'government', 'exploring', 'alternative', 'options', 'furthermore', 'finance', 'minister', 'announced', 'government', 'unveil', 'minibudget', 'jan', '23', 'instead', 'jan', '21', 'associated', 'twoday', 'delay', 'impending', 'foreign', 'trip', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'finance', 'minister', 'said', 'visits', 'lahore', 'karachi', 'regarding', 'onepoint', 'agenda', 'amended', 'finance', 'bill', 'said', 'facilitate', 'businessmen', 'umar', 'indicated', 'amended', 'bill', 'also', 'carry', 'good', 'news', 'pakistan', 'stock', 'exchange', 'psx', 'minister', 'said', 'consulted', 'stakeholders', 'upcoming', 'minibudget', 'assuring', 'assortment', 'businessmen', 'tax', 'anomalies', 'eliminated', 'budget', 'minister', 'rejected', 'impression', 'government', 'borrowing', 'money', 'stressing', 'several', 'agreements', 'also', 'signed', 'bring', 'investment', 'country', 'impacts', 'investment', 'agreements', 'start', 'surfacing', 'next', 'week', 'added', 'asad', 'umar', 'even', 'sworn', 'said', 'economy', 'would', 'need', 'infusion', '12', 'billion', 'within', 'six', 'weeks', 'later', 'interview', 'bloomberg', 'said', 'nation', 'financial', 'gap', 'somewhere', '10bn', '12bn', 'adding', 'new', 'government', 'would', 'need', 'bit', 'extra', 'live', 'edge', 'october', 'last', 'year', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'announced', '6', 'billion', 'bailout', 'package', 'pakistan', 'ailing', 'economy', 'package', 'includes', '3bn', 'balance', 'payments', 'support', 'much', 'deferred', 'payments', 'oil', 'imports', 'uae', 'also', 'announced', 'package', 'exactly', 'size', 'terms', 'conditions', 'given', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'allweather', 'friend', 'china', 'pledged', 'lend', '2', 'billion', 'pakistan', 'shore', 'dwindling', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'reserves', 'moreover', 'islamabad', 'riyadh', 'expected', 'ink', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'mous', 'bring', 'saudi', 'investment', 'excess', '10bn', 'month', 'pakistan', 'also', 'eyeing', 'similar', 'mous', 'china', 'united', 'arab', 'emirates', 'malaysia', 'next', 'two', 'months', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'also', 'approved', 'strategy', 'issue', 'socalled', 'panda', 'bonds', 'chinese', 'market', 'raise', 'foreign', 'exchange', 'global', 'markets', 'budget', 'bomb', 'meanwhile', 'pakistan', 'peoples', 'party', 'ppp', 'statement', 'strongly', 'opposed', 'government', 'upcoming', 'minibudget', 'party', 'vice', 'president', 'senator', 'sherry', 'rehman', 'expressed', 'grave', 'reservations', 'rising', 'inflation', 'government', 'announcement', 'mini', 'budget', 'inquilab', 'sarkar', 'revolutionary', 'government', 'announce', 'new', 'mini', 'budget', 'every', 'four', 'months', 'asked', 'said', 'government', 'make', 'preparations', 'annual', 'budget', 'time', 'announce', 'mini', 'budget', 'ppp', 'leader', 'likened', 'decision', 'budget', 'bomb', 'dropped', 'people', 'based', 'supposed', 'conditions', 'put', 'forth', 'imf', 'every', 'month', 'new', 'taxes', 'imposed', 'commodity', 'sees', 'hike', 'prices', 'one', 'day', 'prices', 'medicines', 'go', 'next', 'mini', 'budget', 'announced', 'rehman', 'said', 'adding', 'government', 'robbing', 'people', 'right', 'live', 'said', 'tsunami', 'change', 'transformed', 'storm', 'inflation', 'rehman', 'recalled', 'inflation', 'stood', '58', 'per', 'cent', 'july', 'whereas', 'gone', '62pc', 'said', 'claimed', 'friends', 'businessmen', 'fact', 'enemies', 'declared', 'government', 'incapable', 'running', 'economy', 'ppp', 'leader', 'criticising', 'government', 'performance', 'said', 'past', 'five', 'months', 'done', 'nothing', 'raise', 'slogans', 'economy', 'accountability']","['going', 'imf', 'minibudget', 'unveiled', 'jan', '23', 'asad', 'umar']"

The chief justice had expressed his disappointment with Dr Rashid's performance since taking charge, saying that he had a lot of expectations from her.

However, in what seemed a departure from his evaluation of the minister's conduct, the chief justice today appreciated Dr Rashid when told by the minister that his recent remarks had led to the opposition demanding her resignation.

Dr Asad Majeed Khan, Pakistan’s new Ambassador to the United States, presented his credentials to US President Donald Trump at a ceremony held at the White House, a press release issued from the country's mission in Washington said on Saturday.

""Ambassador Khan conveyed the greetings of Pakistan’s leadership to President Trump who reciprocated with similar positive sentiments for Prime Minister Imran Khan,"" read the press release.

President Trump, according to the press release, said that he wants to explore opportunities for the two countries to work closely together and to renew their partnership.

The new envoy arrived in Washington earlier this week to take charge of the effort to renew once close relationship between the US and Pakistan.

Dr Majeed, until recently Pakistan’s ambassador in Tokyo, replaced Ali Jehangir Siddiqui who was appointed by the PML-N government days before its departure. Siddiqui held the position for more than seven months from May 9 to Dec 25, 2018 before being relieved of his duties by the incumbent PTI government.

Ambassador Majeed, who was also Pakistan’s deputy ambassador in Washington till 2015, is expected to revive Pakistani lobbies on the Hill that once played an effective role in promoting bilateral ties but have become ineffective due to internal disputes and lack of interest.

",2019-01-12,"Renowned fiction writer and novelist Khalida Hussain passed away on Friday due to complications from a long illness. She was in her 70s.

She had been suffering from various diseases after the tragic death of her only son and husband last year.

Her funeral prayer was held at a local mosque in G-8/2 which was attended by family members, friends and senior writers. The late writer was buried in H-9 graveyard after Asr prayers.

Ms Hussain was known as one of the best fiction writers and novelists in Urdu Literature. She rose to fame in the 60s with her short stories and became a trend setter. Kaghazi Ghat was her last masterpiece in Urdu literature.

Before marriage, she wrote under the name Khalida Asghar.

“Khalida Hussain was the best fiction writer in the country after Intizar Hussain. She always wrote stories on real life and introduced a new trend in Urdu fiction writing,” said poet Iftikhar Arif while talking to Dawn.

Mr Arif said Khalida Hussain’s death was a great loss to Urdu literature, adding that she was a serious writer who worked for women and literature.

“Her work depicted maturity and sensitivity. She focused on social issues and lives of people in her stories,” he said.

Mr Arif said he and Kishwar Naheed visited her just a few days ago.

“She gave us her last book Kaghazi Ghat which is the best novel in modern times,” he said.

Famous writer Hameed Shahid, who had compiled her short stories, told Dawn that Ms Hussain stayed away from publicity.

“Khalida Hussain started her work with short stories that revolved around international crises and their implications on the lives of people,” he said.

She knew how to narrate stories which made it difficult for people to ignore, he added.

",2019-01-12,"AFTER the recent gas shortages across the country, the prime minister sacked the heads of the two distribution companies possibly in an attempt to appear in charge.

However, is such arbitrary sacking of senior officials accepted as a sign of a decisive person in charge — ie the prime minister — exercising executive authority? When you read an analysis of the decision such as the one in this newspaper’s leader on Friday, you form the opposite view.

A few lines from the editorial in a reminder of what it said:

Government officials and ministers can have no excuse for talking up a doomsday scenario and then blaming the media for causing panic.

“On the face of it, assigning blame to the MDs of the gas distribution companies appears odd, given that they are not responsible for the production of gas or for its import. Besides, they neither draw up the merit order list nor do they decide how the pace of the expansion of gas demand is to be regulated. Their role is simply to run the gas distribution system. If there is a shortage of gas in the system, or if there is a technical outage at some point that is going to constrict the supply of gas, this information is available to authorities in the federal government in real time.

“At least four officials in Islamabad, with offices very close to each other — the secretaries for power and petroleum as well as the ministers of these respective divisions — have in their offices screens displaying real-time data on how much gas is in the system, how the fields are functioning, how the distribution system is operating, and so on.

“With all this readily available information, it is difficult to comprehend how blame was assigned to the very last link in the gas supply chain: the heads of the two distribution companies.”

This is a pertinent question. One can be assured there will be no honest answer apart from the one we suspect which, too, will remain unsaid: the need to do something drastic to take notice of the countrywide gas shortage. This was hardly the right thing to do.

The PTI government knows that it enjoys the full support of powerful state institutions and, therefore, it should feel no need to succumb to the temptation of such misplaced gestures and optics which can only demoralise professionals in key positions. It has the room to make mistakes, learn from them and carry on.

There are hints aplenty that the bureaucracy is now treading extremely cautiously, shying away from making decisions, having seen how some of the senior civil servants in the last government are being made to pay for both acts of omission and commission and even uncommitted sins.

The only answer to critics and to all the tentative cogs that make up the government is sure-footed decision-making. Only this creates an order where it is not the fear of recriminations but the pride in making the right decisions for the country’s sake that is the primary motivating factor.

The fiasco of the appointment, or let’s say non-appointment, of the federal government’s spokesman on economy and energy has been discussed in these pages as elsewhere, particularly social media, exhaustively so it needn’t be dwelt upon again but it remains a case in point.

And then, of course, there is the concern regarding the economy that was fuelled by PTI cabinet members when, on coming to power, they started painting a gloomy picture. If they are still in the opposition at least in psychological terms, they should rethink their ways.

Government members and ministers privy to all facts and figures can have no excuse for talking up a doomsday scenario and then blaming the media for running away with stories that caused panic among the people and in the markets.

From devaluation to the deficit, we have had a cacophony of ministerial voices saying contradictory things at different points over the past five months of the PTI government, and while it is easy to blame the media, there has been no attempt to speak with one credible voice on the economy.

From social media to TV talk shows, there is a dozen or so PTI senior members seemingly assigned to represent the government’s point of view but, despite talking a lot, they have disappointingly, for the government, not said much — at least in terms of offering a concrete defence of the government’s position in key areas where it is being subjected to questions and remains at the centre of concerns regarding the economy. What the government may consider is to prepare daily talking points or fact sheets with vital facts and figures that all ministers may use.

One can be sure Imran Khan is a central authority figure in his party and all his senior members and ministers gravitate towards him and are keen to toe his line. The clarity that is so far missing is in what that line may be in vital areas such as the economy and energy to name just two.

Over the medium to long term the government will sink or soar on the strength of its governance, the vision of its policy architects and the competence of its managers. As long as it has the support of state institutions it has no fear of being destabilised like some of the past governments.

Therefore, it is incumbent on it to focus on the way forward. Equally, it needs to clearly spell out its vision to the people. Only this can promote a widespread buy-in and generate confidence about the future.

197,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457096/how-and-when-did-pakistan-lose-its-mojo,"How and when did Pakistan lose its mojo?
",2019-01-12,"OLDER readers will recall that there was a time when Pakistan punched above its weight, and was taken seriously in international forums.

Now, our green passport is listed at fifth from the bottom by the Henley Passport Index that ranks the acceptability of passports by other countries that permit their holders entry on arrival. Thus, Japanese passports, at the top of the index, are accepted at the airports of 190 countries, while 33 nations extend a similar courtesy to Pakistani passports. Even this number seems a bit high, considering the hoops Pakistanis are made to jump through when applying for a visa to most countries.

So when did the slide to the bottom begin? And how and when did Pakistan lose its mojo? I addressed these questions in a column three years ago, and used cricket as a metaphor to capture our decline. But now as our team is getting thrashed by South Africa, while the Indian team has become the first team from South Asia to achieve a series win against Australia on its own turf, cricket will no longer serve as a metaphor.

So when did the slide to the bottom begin?

The harsh reality is that Pakistan is now regarded as a bankrupt country that mistreats its minorities and women, and is a violent, dangerous country to visit. The PTI government has been touting Pakistan as ‘an investment hub’, but who are we trying to kid? The sight of Imran Khan travelling to friendly countries with begging bowl in hand is a national humiliation, although given fiscal realities, he really had no choice.

So why have things got so bad? Wars have consequences, and this is something past generals did not manage to grasp. The 1965 war over Kashmir under Ayub Khan, the 1971 war under Yahya Khan, and the absurd Kargil conflict unleashed by Musharraf all had one thing in common: they were led by generals who had seized power through coups.

Out of the three wars, the 1971 conflict with India has left the deepest scars, and not just because we lost on the battlefield. The bloody civil war and the widespread killing of Bengalis tarnished Pakistan’s image around the globe. This event was followed by decades of increasing levels of extremism that led to terrorism on a huge scale. Minorities and foreigners have been targeted, and the state and security personnel challenged as never before.

As a result, the abiding image of Pakistan abroad has been that of a breeding and training centre for jihadis. Although the security environment has improved considerably over the last year, many still see the country as ground zero for the global jihad. Every now and then, televised images of ferocious, bearded men holding the country to ransom are beamed around the world.

And with a population that has exploded to some 220 million, rampant poverty, widespread illiteracy and unpredictable policies, Pakistan is perceived as a nation on the brink. We may think this is an unfair picture, but like it or not, this is how the world sees us. And ever so often, cases like those of Malala Yousafzai and Asiya Bibi remind the world how women and minorities are treated.

Constant political upheavals have not helped in changing this perception. Elected governments have either been turfed out by the military establishment, or destabilised by ambitious rivals. A hyperactive judiciary has added to the political uncertainty.

With all these negative factors, the positive elements get overlooked. Above all, Pakistan is a very resilient country that has withstood a host of problems, many of them are of our own making. Futile wars, support for extremism, and a limitless appetite for loans to pay for our defence forces have pushed us into a corner.

Before 1971, our diplomats demanded — and received — ‘parity’ with India from foreign states. They were consulted by other Third World countries at the United Nations, and respected in the chanceries of global powers. Those days are long gone. Now they have the single-point agenda of Kashmir that they try to push with no success.

Indeed, the rest of the world is tired of the 70-year-old Kashmir problem, and even our closest friends no longer talk about implementing the old UN resolutions on the Valley. This may seem unfair, but who said life was fair? The reality is that India is a huge market, and its soft power gives it a clout few countries can match.

And our two-faced posture towards the Taliban in Afghanistan has served to lose us friends in the West, with Nato soldiers being killed and wounded by fighters who allegedly found shelter in our tribal areas. Small wonder our stock in Washington is the lowest it has been in decades.

So if you wonder how and why we have lost our mojo, look no further.

",2019-01-12,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to give the residents of tribal districts relaxation in the age and qualification criteria for recruitment in its various departments.

Spokesman for the government Ajmal Wazir told reporters at the Chief Minister’s House here on Friday that heads of all government departments had been directed to prepare lists showing their staff and equipment requirements.

He said sports activities would begin in tribal districts on Feb 10, while steps were also being taken to promote tourism there.

Spokesman says locals to get all basic facilities on priority basis

The spokesman said the government would consult the local residents on ways to boost local economy. He said the government was committed to bringing the merged districts on a par with developed ones.

Mr Wazir said both provincial and federal governments were serious about providing all basic facilities to the people of tribal districts on a priority basis to remove the prevailing sense of deprivation in the shortest possible time.

He said Chief Minister Mehmood Khan had already directed revenue officials to address the people’s problems in few months.

The spokesman said the health department had been told to take necessary steps without delay for establishing district headquarters hospitals in tribal districts and providing them with essential medicines and employees.

He said the government was making serious efforts to fulfil the needs of health centers, educational institutions and other departments in tribal districts by hiring employees on adhoc and contractual basis and even age and qualification relaxation would be given to the residents in those jobs.

Mr Wazir said the local residents would be recruited in government departments, including police.

He said the chief minister and other ministers had already visited merged districts on the advice of the prime minister to examine the existing facilities and prepare plans for their development.

The spokesman said the government would extend the independent monitoring unit to various districts to ensure the presence of staff in hospitals, schools and other departments so that the people could see a real change in the system.

He said a powerful committee headed by the chief secretary had been formed for the implementation of all government decisions in tribal districts.

Mr Wazir said the committee would thoroughly examine the activities of departments in the region and take necessary steps for their improvement.

He said the chief minister had visited Bajaur and Khyber districts and would visit other districts soon to learn about the residents’ problems and order their resolution.

199,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456953/two-years-on-senates-directives-to-regulate-housing-societies-not-yet-enforced,"Two years on, Senate’s directives to regulate housing societies not yet enforced
",2019-01-12,"ISLAMABAD: Even after two-and-a-half years, the city managers have failed to properly implement the recommendations of the Senate to regulate housing societies.

In 2016, two reports compiled by the Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice had pointed fingers at the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the local administration for the mushroom growth of illegal housing schemes and the violation of layout plans by genuine cooperative housing societies.

The reports, which were adopted by the Senate in 2016 and by the CDA in March 2018, are yet to be properly implemented.

Two reports prepared by a standing committee in 2016 pointed fingers at CDA and capital administration for growth of housing societies

In one of the reports about the cooperative housing schemes, the Senate had recommended that the violations of layout plans committed by housing schemes may be accommodated by amending the regulations.

However, the house had directed the civic agencies that no compromise should be made regarding public parks.

After being informed that green areas and amenity plots had been sold out by housing societies, the Senate had recommended that any land adjacent to the housing schemes may be bought and utilised as public parks while space for graveyards should be acquired in the vicinities of the societies.

Two to three cooperative societies can also make joint ventures for providing and maintaining such a space. The report also said alternative sites should be given for public buildings.

The Senate had also directed that the role of the CDA and capital administration officers and officials in the mushroom growth of illegal housing societies should be identified.

The CDA was also recommended to acquire land for the development of sectors and get land in Zone 3 for the Margalla Hills National Park.

However, the sources said, the recommendations of the upper house of parliament were not properly implemented.

When contacted, CDA spokesman Syed Safdar Ali claimed that the civic agency had been implementing the recommendations.

“Nothing is pending on our part and approval will be processed once formalities are completed. During the last four year, no scheme has been approved formally as documentation is not completed by sponsors,” he said.

But sources said the level of violations made by housing societies was so enormous that in many cases it was practically not possible for them to comply with the recommendations.

For example, they added, it was recommended that land adjacent to a housing society which violated its layout plan should be bought by the same society to provide public parks and graveyards.

“In the surrounding of many societies, no unutilised land is available,” said the sources.

Meanwhile, in a related development, the civic agency issued notices to 13 housing societies for the recovery of Rs1.5 billion pending against them in terms of excess charges, extension of development period, changes in approved layout plans and development without obtaining no-objection certificates.

According to CDA documents, Cabinet Division Society has to pay Rs181 million, Engineers’ Society Rs71 million, Khayaban-i-Kashmir-I Rs261m, Margalla View Rs93m, Ministry of Interior Housing Society Rs94m, Multi Gardens-I, Rs337m, Tele Gardens Rs83m, Zarkoon Heights Rs16m, Bahria Town Phase-7 Rs3.8m, Capital Enclave Rs41m, CBR Town Rs34m, Gulberg Town Rs34m and Jinnah Town Rs91m.

Officials said the CDA on and off took action against housing societies which had got layout plans approved or had NOCs but there were over 100 totally illegal housing societies against whom no proper action was taken on time. In most of such societies, their operators have sold out plots to the citizens.

They said in such schemes on the directions of the CDA now utility connections were not being provided to the residents.

The CDA spokesman said action was being taken against both illegal housing societies and those that had deficiencies in their layout plans.

Chief Justice of Pakistan-designate Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan and other judges were also present.

Justice Nisar said he always kept in mind the constitutional limits of the judiciary and other institutions. The sole purpose of his visits to hospitals was to ensure correct utilisation of government resources.

The chief justice said he would have made mistakes intentionally or unintentionally but whatever he did was for the rule of law only. He reiterated that he never tried to disgrace anyone.

Sharing his experience of holding open courts, the chief justice said he met people in public hospitals having no money to buy medicines.

He regretted that the people were not getting justice in time in courts. “We also miss quality of arguments by lawyers in the courts nowadays,” added the chief justice. He advised the judges of district judiciary to do their work like a passion, and not a job.

The chief justice said he witnessed top lawyers of their time like Ijaz Batalvi and SM Zafar advancing arguments in courts well before joining the legal profession. “My association with Lahore High Court is 56-year-old as I used to visit this premises with my father during my school days,” he said.

“My whole life, I tried to become a fair judge as it carries a great reward in life after death.”

He urged lawyers to do hard work as they were part and parcel of the judicial system. He lamented that petitions being filed under section 22-A of Cr.P.C (against non registration of FIR) had hijacked the courts. He said the judges were not supposed to ensure registration of cases.

He pointed out that a police reform package was going to be introduced on Jan 14 in Islamabad with the support of the law and justice commission.

Chief Justice Nisar told the bar with a pride that Supreme Judicial Council had decided all the pending references against the judges and was left with two only. The judiciary was holding its accountability on merit, the chief justice added and urged the lawyers to also put their house in order.

Police said Assistant District Public Prosecutor Naila Amjad would routinely go to a gym along with her husband Muhammad Zaman, a teacher at a private school.

",2019-01-12,"LAHORE: Scores of shopkeepers launched a massive protest by blocking the main road after an elderly fruit seller died of a cardiac arrest during an anti-encroachment operation in the Multan Road (Chungi) vegetable and fruit market on Friday.

The shopkeepers also besieged the encroachment team head (city assistant commissioner), forcing the officials to leave the area. They refused to lift the body of 60-year-old Sharif from the road and end the protest till registration of criminal cases against all those conducting the anti-encroachment operation.

Read: No injustice to be done during anti-encroachment drive: PM

“We will neither remove the body of Sharif nor will we end the protest until registration of cases on murder charges against the officials who launched the operation,” Qaisar, a vendor, told Dawn.

“What this government wants to do with us... it seems it wants to kill the poor people,” he deplored.

The city administration had decided a couple of days ago to launch operations in city’s five vegetable & fruit markets including the one on Multan Road (Mandi stop) near Mansoora. A team comprising city and respective zonal / town officials and led by AC (City) Ahmad Raza Butt removed 300 temporarily built shops in the market and arrested four people for protesting and offering resistance.

The teams even crushed fruits and vegetables under the wheels of the tractors.

“Some officials manhandled the vendors including Sharif who collapsed and died on the spot,” alleged a vendor.

AC Ahmad Raza Butt told Dawn the operation was carried out in the light of instructions issued by the agriculture department.

“This market was turned into a non-formal set-up as no auction had been done for a long time. Those who had been allotted shops had left the businesses and these were being used for other purposes such as workshops. Many people had illegally occupied various spaces and the operation was meant to remove such encroachments / businesses and revive the market,” he claimed.

He denied that the vendor died due to manhandling. In fact, the vendors were selling fruits / vegetables in a street leading to the market and the operation was carried out only inside the market, he said.

“Whenever such operations are carried out, the vendors start fleeing with their wheel carts. So the vendor might have suffered a heart attack in a bid to hastily move away,” he said.

The protesters held talks with the senior officials including the SP (city) and demanded that the Chief Justice of Pakistan take notice of the situation.

“We appeal to the CJP to take suo motu notice and order registration of cases against the officials,” a protester demanded.

",2019-01-12,"KARACHI: The Karachi Eat Festival (KEF), despite competition from several other smaller festivals held in the city, enjoys a cult-like status and on Friday, the event’s opening day, Karachiites thronged the Beach Park in Clifton to partake in the latest culinary offerings that aim to push the traditional boundaries of fast food and gourmet meals.

“With around 95 food stalls this year, almost 56 are of home cooks, or budding ‘foodpreneurs’, who don’t have restaurants of their own, who are the real gems of the festival,” says Omar Omari of CKO Event Architecture, the organisers of the festival.

There are many success stories that have come out from the KEF. Wingitt, Desi Gali, Jucy Lucy all started off as stalls at the KEF and ventured out and became big businesses. Babamoo is one such success story that has emerged from the KEF and has made a name in Karachi’s culinary world.

‘Karachi is an audience hungry for innovation in the area of food’

Run by brothers Ibad and Nabil, along with two other partners, the Babamoo stall was in full swing on the first day as the orders had already started rolling in moments after the KEF was officially open. “When we first took part in last year’s KEF we wanted to launch an item that hadn’t been introduced to foodies in Karachi before — the jacket potato and innovative toppings. To be honest we had not expected it to sell much as it was a niche product. However, the outcome and feedback we got was tremendous. Within five hours we had sold off the stock we had planned for three days.”

The brothers opened up their first restaurant in March. Nabil is of the opinion that “Karachi is an audience hungry for innovation in the area of food and the KEF is an essential place that provides a platform to budding foodpreneurs.”

Tayyaba Gul’s patisserie tucked away in one corner at the KEF is another such home-based venture that is introducing to the Karachi audience flavours from France. A graduate of Le Cordon Bleu, she returned to Pakistan almost two years ago and established Le Saint Honoré Pâtisserie, which focuses entirely on French desserts. Her signature offering are smaller versions of the St. Honoré cake, also known as St. Honoratus cake, which is a pastry named for the French patron saint of bakers and pastry chefs.

According to Omari, the design philosophy behind KEF is to make the festival look premium but making it accessible to everybody. This allows those from all walks of life access to a shared space at the same time, and on Friday the KEF seemed to have successfully accomplished this vision.

A parking map, event layout and stalls list is provided on the Facebook page of the festival. The KEF 2019 will continue on Saturday and Sunday, from 12.30pm to 10.30pm.

",2019-01-12,"KARACHI: On the 109th day of their sit-in outside the Karachi Press Club and following a protest rally they had staged a day earlier, the 1,751 dock workers of Port Qasim Authority were paid their long overdue salaries on Friday.

It was a sigh of relief for the workers, who were paid five months’ salaries, from July 18 to November 18, through two cheques of a total amount of Rs20.547 million after a meeting between representatives of Huaneng Fuyun Port and Shipping (HFPS), which handles berths three and four at Port Qasim, and representatives of the workers, social workers, human rights activists and trade unionists.

The cheques were handed over by Chen Long, executive director of the HFPS, to Hussain Badshah, the secretary general of the Workers Union of Port Qasim. Nasir Mansoor of the National Trade Union Federation, as the convener of the Workers Action Committee for Dock Workers, was also present.

He and Karamat Ali of the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research congratulated the workers for successfully holding their ground by carrying a peaceful protest for so long and for finally seeing their demands met by their employers. “We are extremely happy for the poor dock workers and their families,” Karamat Ali told Dawn.

The workers are now to be paid only their December salaries and they have also been asked to fulfil certain recruitment requirements by their Chinese employers in the contracts offered to them.

205,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456937/opposition-stages-walkout-against-deputy-speakers-biased-attitude,"Opposition stages walkout against deputy speaker’s ‘biased attitude’
",2019-01-12,"KARACHI: Opposition members in the Sindh Assembly, barring two minor parties, on Friday walked out of the house, accusing the deputy speaker of “bulldozing” their business and showering “undue” favours upon the treasury benches.

The treasury benches, on the other hand, said members of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and the Grand Democratic Alliance — which collectively formed the combined opposition in the assembly — left the house on “baseless” issues having nothing to do with the betterment of their constituents.

Initially, the MQM and the GDA joined the PTI to march out of the house when all of them accused Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari, who was presiding over the proceedings, of not allowing them to ask supplementary questions during Question Hour.

IT minister says steps being taken to install 10,000 security cameras in Karachi

With the opposition — barring Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s Abdul Rasheed and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s Mohammad Qasim — out of the house, there was smooth sailing for the treasury benches, which took advantage of the conditions and concluded Question Hour early.

All the five calling-attention notices were filed by the opposition members and none of them could be taken up as the movers were absent.

Similarly, a privilege motion filed by MQM-P’s Mohammad Hussain could also not be taken up. However, as soon as the house was tackling other business, Mr Hussain returned along with some other colleagues and GDA’s Nand Kumar.

He demanded the chair to go back to the day’s agenda and allow him to move his privilege motion.

The chair said the time for the motion had lapsed.

Mr Hussain’s certain words were inaudible to the galleries. However, Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani requested the chair that his words be expunged.

The MQM-P lawmaker later stayed for a while in front of the chair and warned: “Now, we’ll tell how the house is run.”

Later, he fired a broadside at the chair along with PTI’s parliamentary party leader Haleem Shaikh as both accused her of forming “a dictatorship”.

The bitterness in the house emerged during Question Hour when Information Technology Minister Taimur Talpur was criticised, first by PTI’s Khurram Sher Zaman and then by GDA’s Mustafa Jatoi while the former was responding to queries.

Both sides exchanged personal remarks directed against each other.

Spelling bee?

Mr Jatoi insisted that the minister should spell out the word “science”. His assertion was regarded as non-serious for a parliamentarian by the treasury benches.

Soon, the opposition benches rose and protested when the chair jumped to the next question when, as opposition members insisted, they were yet to ask supplementary questions.

Ms Leghari said the opposition members could ask those supplementary questions in the next question as well. However, the opposition members did not accept her suggestion.

Leader of the Opposition Firdous Naqvi walked out from the house and others from his party, the MQM-P and the GDA followed him. Minister Ghani said the opposition’s attitude was “immature”, which instead of focusing on core issues was only confined to playing to the galleries.

Old and obsolete curriculum

Later, MMA’s Rasheed, on a point of order, pointed out “thousands of errors and mistakes” in the school textbooks.

He said the education department should rectify those mistakes as some of them were grave.

Education Minister Sardar Shah admitted that the curriculum was old and obsolete, which merited to be changed at the earliest. He said the syllabus was last reviewed in 2006. His ministry had held a meeting of the curriculum board last year and efforts were being made to revise and improve it.

“I totally agree with the member’s view. I have personally seen more mistakes and errors in the textbooks than Mr Rasheed,” said Mr Shah.

He said order for the current year’s textbooks had already been placed and if they had not been published yet, they would be revised on priority.

He said he had set a deadline for 2020 to revise the entire curricula.

To another assertion by Mr Rasheed about reduction of seats in the Benazir Bhutto Medical College Lyari, Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said the issue belonged to the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, which regulates and decides the ratios of seats in medical colleges and universities.

She said the issue was not in the hand of her ministry to reduce or increase the seats.

About the nursing institute, she had ordered an inquiry into maladministration in the institute.

GDA’s Nand Kumar demanded early recovery of kidnapped Sukkur trader Ramesh Kumar.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Chawla said the provincial government’s efforts had reduced kidnappings for ransom and efforts for Mr Kumar’s recovery were already in full swing.

TLP’s Mohammad Qasim condemned the federal government for resorting to “victimisation” of opponents. He said the arrest of his party’s leader was against the Constitution.

The house fixed the debate on an adjournment motion moved by Heer Soho regarding “failure and apathy” of the Indus River System Authority in sanctioning Sindh’s due share of water on Wednesday.

The Sindh Zakat and Ushr (Amendment) Bill, 2018 was passed unanimously.

Plan to install 10,000 cameras in Karachi

In Question Hour, the house was informed that a consultant had been hired to prepare a feasibility report and PC-I of the project of installation of 10,000 cameras in the city.

Answering a question, Information, Science and Technology Minister Talpur said that the project of installation of cameras in the city was initiated by the home department on the orders of the Supreme Court.

He said that process of hiring the consultant was under way.

To another question, the minister said that the provincial government did not earn any revenue from the installation of mobile phone towers as the matter was under the domain of the federal government and did not pertain to the provincial information, science and technology department.

In reply to a question, the minister said that as many as 39 websites were being maintained by different provincial government departments.

Besides, he said that there was no IT training centre at district level.

",2019-01-12,"ISLAMABAD: A law suit has been filed against former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and his driver, Abid Nawaz, over the death of a police constable in a road accident last year.

The plaintiff, Aurangzeb Abbasi, who filed the suit under “Fatal Accident Act, 1855”, sought over Rs20 million in compensation from the ex-premier and his driver over the death of his son, police constable Zeeshan Abbasi, in the road accident.

According to the application, “on September 22, 2018 when Zeeshan was coming from Islamabad to Faizabad, Rawalpindi on his personal bike (RIN-737), a land cruiser (GU-027) rashly and negligently driven by defendant no 2 [Nawaz] hit him from back. As a result of this accident, Zeeshan was badly [injured and] died on the spot.”

It said the driver was arrested but was granted bail. Since the former prime minister was the owner of the vehicle, he was also responsible for the fatal accident, the plaintiff argued.

He said his son died due to lack of care. Zeeshan was the bread earner of a large family, the plaintiff said, while seeking compensation of Rs20,647,200.

The court admitted the law suit and issued summons for the ex-premier and his drive for January 17.

",2019-01-12,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and the Majlis-i-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) have formed a joint coordination committee to explore prospects for collaboration aimed at realising common goals and objectives.

The six-member coordination committee has been established with the consent of PTI chief and Prime Minister Imran Khan and MWM chief Allama Nasir Abbas.

The committee will consist of three members each from the two parties.

The PTI members will be Naeemul Haq, adviser to the PM on political affairs, Ijaz Chaudhary, central deputy secretary general, and Syed Ali Zaidi, federal minister for maritime affairs.

Syed Nasir Abbas Sheerazi, Syed Asad Abbas Naqvi and Syed Mohsin Shehryar will represent the MWM.

The MWM and PTI developed working relations during the 2014 sit-in against the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

The MWM had raised its voice against the Model Town operation in June of the same year by the Punjab government in which 14 workers of Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), led by Allama Tahir ul Qadri, lost their lives.

The MWM had joined the sit-in in support of PAT, but it did not take long for the party to make an impression on Tehreek-i-Insaf and its leader, Imran Khan, thanks to its disciplined workers who stood their ground in the face of clashes with police and harsh weather.

The two parties had an electoral understanding for last year’s general election, enabling an MWM candidate to make it to the Punjab Assembly.

Talking to Dawn, a member of the coordination committee said the body would try to find elements common to the two parties’ election manifestoes and work out a plan for their implementation.

Among the key issues highlighted by the MWM and already taken up by the PTI-led government were resolution of problems faced by pilgrims at Taftan border with Iran and measures for their security on the Quetta–Taftan road.

",2019-01-12,"QUETTA: The federal government has assured the Balochistan government that it would be taken on board while taking decisions on exploration and development of natural resources and it would be given share from the resources.

The decision was taken in a meeting on Friday which was attended by Chief Minister of Balochistan Jam Kamal Khan Alyani, Fed­eral Minister for Petroleum Ghulam Sarwar Khan and other concerned authorities.

Moreover, the meeting decided to set up a joint working group comprising federal and provincial authorities which would take decisions on exploration and development of natural resources in the province.

The joint working group, besides protecting the rights of Balochistan, will also decide other issues such Sui mining lease, licencing zones, 18th Constitutional Amendment, Petroleum Policy and article 172 (3) and 158 of the Constitution. The meeting agreed on removing reservations of Balochistan and asked the working group to submit its report within a month.

Provincial ministers Mir Saleem Khan Khosa, Mir Zia Langove, Engineer Zamarak Khan Piralizai, Mir Omer Khan Jamali, Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi, Noor Muhammad Dummar, Deputy Speaker of the Balochistan Assembly Sardar Babar Khan Musakhail and senior concerned officials of ministry of petroleum and Balochistan government attended the meeting.

Participants also discussed extension in Sui mining lease, petroleum policy, powers of the provincial government, issuance of licences for mining and exploration in mineral rich areas, agreement signing with exploration companies, the province’s share in mineral-related income, installation of LPG plants and extension of Saindak project’s mining area.

Furthermore, the meeting deliberated on exploration and development of mineral resources in Block 28, gas pressure, reduction in gas rates and the issues of Pakistan Mineral and Development Corporation, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd and gas distribution companies, and generation of employment opportunities and economic activities by the companies involved in mining and exploration.

Jam Kamal, while referring to coalition of the Balochistan Awami Party and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at federal and provincial level, said that the two coalition partners would set a precedent of bilateral cooperation.

“We have witnessed high-level meetings in the past but didn’t see implementation of decision but now there should be progress on all decision because the centre is responsible to take all provinces together.” He stressed upon quick installation of LPG plants in the province.

Endorsing Jam Kamal’s stance, Ghulam Sarwar Khan said the OGDCL and PPL must prepare for the partnership with the provincial government in exploration of mineral and gas projects. He pledged to protect the rights of the province.

210,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457075/na-speaker-seeks-oppositions-help-in-formation-of-committees,"NA speaker seeks opposition’s help in formation of committees
",2019-01-12,"ISLAMABAD: A day after meeting the minister for parliamentary affairs, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaisar on Friday sought the opposition’s cooperation in formation of much-awaited standing committees and smooth running of the house’s business.

The speaker met leaders of two main opposition parties — the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) — and assured them that standing committees would be formed during the coming session of the National Assembly commencing from Monday.

Meanwhile, the PML-N demanded issuance of production orders for Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif and another party leader, Khawaja Saad Rafique, as both of them are under detention while facing corruption cases filed by the National Accountability Bureau.

The speaker also sought the opposition’s support for constituting a high-powered committee for strengthening parliament.

Qaisar holds separate meetings with PPP, PML-N leaders

In the morning, PPP leader Syed Khursheed Shah called on the speaker at his residence, while PML-N legislators Marriyum Aurangzeb and Rana Sanaullah met him in his chamber in the evening.

The delay in the formation of over three dozen committees has badly affected the legislative work of parliament as the National Assembly, which came into existence in August after the general elections held in July, is functioning with only two recently formed committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).

Under the rules, the speaker is bound to constitute all standing and functional committees of the house within 30 days after the election of the leader of the house (prime minister). Since PTI chairman Imran Khan was elected prime minister on Aug 18 last year, the speaker had time till Sept 17 for the formation of the committees.

According to National Assembly Secretariat, the speaker and Khursheed Shah discussed formation of standing committees, legislation and matters regarding other parliamentary affairs.

Seeking the opposition’s cooperation, Speaker Qaisar said it was a joint responsibility of both the government and the opposition to make environment of the National Assembly favorable and maintain its dignity. “We have to uphold parliamentary norms, mutual respect and tolerance for each other for smooth functioning of parliament,” he added.

He said criticism was the right of the opposition but it should be productive and not for the sake of criticising opponents. The speaker stressed the need for joint efforts to overcome the challenges confronting to the country. “The opposition has to play a positive role in resolving national issues through parliament,” he emphasised.

Mr Qaisar lauded the role of the opposition in making environment of the house more friendly and peaceful.

Talking about the formation of standing committees, he said parliamentary committees were an important organ of parliament and without their formation enactment of laws was not possible.

“Formation of parliamentary committees is my foremost priority and I am in contact with members of treasury and opposition benches to resolve this matter as soon as possible,” he added.

“The issue of formation of parliamentary committees would be resolved through mutual consensus in the upcoming session of the National Assembly,” he assured, adding: “Law making is the prime responsibility of parliament and through effective legislation we can solve public issues and increase the dignity of parliament.”

Emphasising the need for presence of members in the house, the speaker said: “Presence of members in parliament reflects their seriousness in the proceedings of the house.”

Khursheed Shah appreciated “balanced” role of the speaker in running the house and assured him of full support of his party in the formation of standing committees. He also appreciated the speaker for resolving the issue of the chairmanship of the PAC and making efforts for formation of standing committees and expressed the hope that the task would soon be accomplished with consensus. He stressed the need for cooperation between the government and the opposition for smooth legislation.

Last month, Prime Minister Imran Khan conceded the chairmanship of the all-powerful PAC to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif to end a nearly four-month impasse between the government and the opposition over the issue that had forced the speaker to stop the process of formation of the committees due to the opposition’s threat to boycott these bodies if the ruling party did not offer the office to Mr Sharif as per “parliamentary traditions”.

Sources said that an understanding between the government and the opposition had already been reached on the distribution of the chairmanship of 38 standing committees. Under the agreed formula, the chairmanship of 18 committees would go to the opposition while the remaining 20 committees would be headed by the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and its allies.

However, they said, the two sides were yet to discuss the committees to be distributed among the treasury and opposition members.

The opposition parties, the sources said, wanted to head important committees like those on interior, foreign affairs, power and finance.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan on Thursday called on the speaker and stressed the need for early formation of standing committees and the matters pertaining to the agenda of the coming session of the National Assembly, according to an official announcement by the NA Secretariat.

During meeting with the PML-N leaders, the speaker assured them that the remaining 36 standing committees of the lower house would be formed during the coming session.

Talking to Dawn, Marriyum Aurangzeb said that the speaker also assured them that he would issue production orders for Shahbaz Sharif and Saad Rafique before beginning of the next session. She said the speaker was also making efforts for formation of a high-powered committee for strengthening parliament and he also sought the opposition’s support in this regard.

211,https://www.dawn.com/news/1457077/us-report-speaks-of-drug-resistant-typhoid-cases-in-pakistan,"US report speaks of drug-resistant typhoid cases in Pakistan
",2019-01-12,"WASHINGTON: There has been an outbreak of an extensively drug-resistant Salmonella Typhi in Pakistan where 5,372 cases of this typhoid fever were reported between 2016 and 2018, says an official US report.

Most of the cases were reported from Karachi and Hyderabad, warned the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in its “Morbidity and Mortality” report.

The CDC researchers warn that the outbreak in Pakistan involves a Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi strain that is resistant to most antibiotics commonly used to treat the illness.

The report notes that 29 patients were diagnosed in the US with typhoid fever and all of them had travelled to or from Pakistan from 2016 to 2018.

The patients include five children with extensively drug-resistant infections. At least one travel-associated case was reported from the United Kingdom.

Comparing this to the 2006-15 period, the report points out that 79 per cent of US travellers to Pakistan who returned with typhoid fever during that period responded to therapeutic antibiotics.

The report — “Emergence of Extensively Drug-Resistant Salmonella Typhi Infections Among Travellers to or from Pakistan” — that between November 2016 and September 2017, 339 cases of this extensively drug-resistant Typhi strain were reported in Pakistan, mostly in Karachi and Hyderabad. But the number of cases rapidly increased to 5,372 by the end of 2018.

The disease is resistant to most therapeutic antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins.

But it can be cured with azithromycin and carbapenems. Carbapenems are a class of highly effective antibiotic agents commonly used for the treatment of severe or high-risk bacterial infections.

Researchers say that vaccination can help prevent typhoid fever but warn that common therapeutic antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, should not be used for empiric treatment of typhoid fever patients.

Instead, Azithromycin should be used to treat patients with suspected uncomplicated typhoid fever and carbapenems for patients with suspected severe or complicated typhoid fever.

The signs of complications include encephalopathy, which impacts the functioning of the brain, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, intestinal hemorrhage, or bacteremia with sepsis or shock.

The report also warns against the spread of the drug-resistant Typhi strain to neighbouring countries such as India. It notes that returning travellers from India typically account for 57 per cent to 69 per cent of typhoid fever cases reported to CDC.

Since a large number of people travel between the United States and South Asia, the US Department of Health regularly monitors outbreaks of various diseases in the region. Air travel monitors reported an estimated 2.4 million trips from the United States to India and 250,000 trips to Pakistan in 2017.

",2019-01-12,"QUETTA: A total of 119 people — including 15 police personnel — were killed and 114 injured in terrorism-related incidents in Balochistan during 2018.

Twenty-five terrorists were also killed in encounters and 55 arrested in 1,245 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in the province.

Inspector General of Police Mohsin Butt disclosed this while briefing reporters at his office on Friday.

He said that 1,245 IBOs and 1,869 combing operations were conducted under the National Action Plan across Balochistan in 2018 in which 55 terrorists were killed and 4,188 absconders and 5,449 accused were arrested. They belonged to 22 militant groups.

He said that another 898 suspects had been arrested during IBO operations.

IG Butt said that besides seizure of 21,103 weapons, 2,536kgs of narcotics were also recovered. He added that a total of 8,755 incidents of crimes — including 42 sabotage activities, 34 targeted killings and 11 sectarian killings — were reported in 2018 as compared to 9,490 in 2017.

He said the Balochistan police had started implementing recommendations of the Law and Justice Commission, headed by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, from Jan 8 to hold police accountable and redress public complaints.

He said the commission’s report would be formally launched on Jan 14 at the Islamabad High Court.

“The purpose of this exercise is to restore the trust of the public in the police force and bridge the gap between them, besides making police forces accountable so that overall improvement could be made in their capability,” IG Butt told reporters.

In the recommendations, he said, there was an emphasis on redressing of complaints against police personnel such as delay in registration of FIRs — especially in criminal cases — or delay in arrest of accused in these FIRs.

He said separate cells had been established in all 33 districts of Balochistan. These cells would be equipped with all facilities, including internet, computers and phones, to receive public complaints via email. He said the complainants would receive feedback about their complaints at each stage.

In reply to a question, IG Butt said that 1,800 more recruitments would be made in the police force and 1,000 of them had been sent to Sindh for basic training, while the remaining 800 would be trained in Balochistan. He said there was sharp decline in crime and terrorist activities in Quetta due to deployment of the newly-introduced Eagle squad comprising 800 personnel.

He said the strength of the anti-terrorist force (ATF) would be increased to 2,000 in the province. Presently, the number of ATF personnel is around 850.

",2019-01-12,"RAWALPINDI/KARACHI: The Safety Investigation Board (SIB) tasked with a probe into the 2016 crash of a domestic flight that killed all the 47 people on board, including singer-turned-evangelist Junaid Jamshed, has found a ‘lapse’ on the part of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and a ‘lack of oversight’ by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that may have led to the tragic incident.

On Dec 7, 2016, PIA aircraft ATR42-500 (PK-661) en route to Islamabad from Chitral had crashed into the mountains near Havelian tehsil of Abbottabad.

“The investigation is nearing a concluding stage, however, some important findings of technical nature require immediate attention/intervention,” said the one-page preliminary report of the SIB.

Asks national flag carrier to evaluate its oversight mechanism to discover lapses, ascertain shortfalls and undertake improvements

The SIB, an independent body that comes under the aviation division, has shared its report with the CAA and PIA.

PIA spokesman Mashood Tajwar told Dawn that the SIB’s findings were not a full report on the air crash but initial recommendations. He said: “The SIB’s suggestions will be followed and a reply will be submitted by the airlines.”

The SIB report said that the sequence of events began with dislodging of one blade of power turbine stage-1, inside engine-1 (left side engine), due to fatigue. This dislodging of one blade resulted in an in-flight engine shutdown and it contributed towards erratic/ abnormal behaviour of No 1 propeller.

According to the service bulletin, these turbine blades were to be changed after completion of 10,000 hours (of use) on next immediate maintenance opportunity. The said engine was under maintenance on Nov 11, 2016 and at that time these blades had completed 10,004.1 hours (of use) and were due for a change. This activity should have been undertaken at that time, but it was missed out by those concerned, the SIB report said.

According to it, the aircraft flew approximately 93 hours after the said maintenance activity before it crashed.

“Missing out of such an activity highlights a lapse on the part of PIAC (maintenance and quality assurance) and a possible inadequacy/lack of oversight by the CAA,” it said.

“The PIAC should ensure immediate implementation of the service bulletin in letter and spirit on the entire fleet of ATR aircraft, undertake an audit of the related areas of maintenance practices, ascertain root causes for the said lapse, and adopt appropriate corrective measures to avoid recurrence of such incidents,” the SIB recommended.

It suggested that the PIA should evaluate its oversight mechanism for its adequacy to discover lapses and intervene in a proactive manner, ascertain shortfall and undertake necessary improvements.

A senior official of the CAA said that the authority would give its view on the SIB report in a few days after reviewing it.

Formal marriage or informal union before age 18 occurs throughout the world, it added. However, being forced into marriage before one was able to give consent violates the basic human rights of boys and girls, the report said.

It further said that the percentage of child marriage remained high in Sindh, with 72 per cent girls and 25 per cent boys becoming victims to this menace, however, the highest number of girl child marriages were recorded in the tribal areas of Pakistan, with 99 per cent girls married under this unlawful traditional practice.",APP,"['recent', 'report', 'issued', 'world', 'health', 'organisation', 'shed', 'light', 'issue', 'child', 'marriages', 'pakistan', 'saying', 'practice', 'common', 'rural', 'areas', 'said', '140', 'million', 'underage', 'girls', 'likely', 'get', 'married', '2011', '2020', 'according', 'report', 'titled', 'demographics', 'child', 'marriages', 'pakistan', 'child', 'marriage', 'remains', 'serious', 'concern', 'pakistan', '21', 'per', 'cent', 'girls', 'getting', 'married', 'reaching', 'age', '18', 'especially', 'rural', 'areas', 'editorial', 'child', 'marriage', 'bill', 'formal', 'marriage', 'informal', 'union', 'age', '18', 'occurs', 'throughout', 'world', 'added', 'however', 'forced', 'marriage', 'one', 'able', 'give', 'consent', 'violates', 'basic', 'human', 'rights', 'boys', 'girls', 'report', 'said', 'said', 'percentage', 'child', 'marriage', 'remained', 'high', 'sindh', '72', 'per', 'cent', 'girls', '25', 'per', 'cent', 'boys', 'becoming', 'victims', 'menace', 'however', 'highest', 'number', 'girl', 'child', 'marriages', 'recorded', 'tribal', 'areas', 'pakistan', '99', 'per', 'cent', 'girls', 'married', 'unlawful', 'traditional', 'practice']","['21pc', 'girls', 'pakistan', 'become', 'victim', 'child', 'marriage', 'reports']"

",2019-01-11,"Police on Friday arrested two security guards from Jamshoro who allegedly attacked a Chinese national in Karachi's DHA neighbourhood with a knife and robbed him of Rs3 million cash and other valuables late on Thursday night.

The held suspects are guards of a private security company named Polizia, DIG South Sharjeel Karim Kharal said.

The injured Chinese national, Shi Qingpu, was residing in Karachi while doing private business, the officer revealed.

Darakshan police said Shi was at his residence located on Khayaban-i-Rahat in DHA Phase VI on Thursday night when his two guards stabbed him and made away with Rs3m in cash.

After receiving information about the incident, the DIG South established a special team which managed to arrest the suspects after they had fled Karachi, at Jamshoro Toll Plaza. The cash looted by the suspects, a mobile phone, the knife used in the incident and a Mauser pistol were recovered from them by the police.

The injured foreigner was admitted to a private hospital in Clifton where SSP South Pir Mohammad Shah and Clifton SP Suhai Aziz met him. His condition was stated to be out of danger.

",2019-01-11,"Nawaz Sharif's daughter Maryam Nawaz on Friday claimed that her father was suffering from a pain in his arm, ""which is most likely to be angina"", and complained that Sharif's cardiologists ""have been trying to get access to him all day but [the] permission [has] not [been] granted"".

The ousted prime minister is serving a seven-year sentence for corruption in Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail.

""He [Nawaz] needs to be examined by the doctors who are privy to his complicated medical history,"" Maryam wrote on Twitter.

Sharif had undergone an open-heart surgery about three years ago in London.

Maryam, who had visited her father in the jail on Thursday, also retweeted a post by a PML-N worker, who claimed that although Sharif had been complaining about the pain in his arm since the morning, his personal doctor had not been allowed to examine him.

""Dr Adnan [Sharif's personal doctor] has urged [the] Medical officer that Mian sb is [a] heart patient and pain in arm is [a] very dangerous symptom, but he has been asked to visit on Monday,"" he tweeted.

Punjab govt refutes claim

Dr Shahbaz Gill, the spokesperson for the Punjab chief minister, in a video refuted claims that Sharif was being denied a meeting with his personal doctor, saying Maryam's allegations were ""completely false"".

Contradicting Maryam's tweet, he claimed that Dr Adnan had contacted the jail administration to request a meeting with Sharif at 5:38 in the evening.

However, Gill stated, a jail doctor had already conducted Sharif's medical check-up earlier in the day; the doctor found the PML-N chief to be healthy and his blood pressure, sugar level and ECG to be normal. Dr Adnan was therefore directed to visit the jail tomorrow to meet Sharif and he acknowledged the same, the spokesperson added.

Jail security officials had earlier told DawnNewsTV that the prison's medical officer, Dr Afsar Khan, conducted Sharif's medical check-up at around 4:30pm today. They quoted the doctor as saying that the former prime minister's condition was fine and there was no active complaint by him. His blood pressure, pulse and blood sugar levels were all normal.

Ahsan Iqbal's warning

Meanwhile, senior PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal in a tweet alleged that the government was ""deliberately"" depriving Nawaz and his brother Shahbaz of medical facilities.

""If something happens to the health of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, [we] will have a case registered against Prime Minister [Imran Khan], the chief minister, interior secretary and the jail superintendent,"" the former federal minister cautioned.

Sharif had requested a meeting with his physician after complaining of flu and fever earlier this week. He had also complained about ""poor"" facilities in the jail. “However, I am in good health,” he was quo­ted as having said by a PML-N leader who met him on Thursday.

The PML-N quaid was taken to Adiala jail after he was sentenced to seven years in prison in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills case on December 24 by an accountability court in Islamabad. He was later shifted to Kot Lakhpat jail on his own request.

The former premier was fined Rs1.5 billion and $25 million.

",2019-01-11,"After more than four months of dilly-dallying, India has agreed to fulfil its commitment of getting its two hydropower projects — 1,000MW Pakal Dul and 48MW Lower Kalnal — inspected by Pakistani experts, officials said on Friday.

Pakistani Commissioner for Indus Waters Mehr Ali Shah said a delegation of Pakistani experts will visit the two Indian project sites on Chenab River for an inspection, scheduled for later this month.

""India has also given positive signals regarding inspection of other projects constructed on Chenab River,"" he revealed while speaking to DawnNewsTV.

Examine: Why the Indus Water Treaty has stood the test of time

Shah said Pakistan had achieved this ""success"" after forcefully raising the issue of India's violation of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)

Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda hailed the development as a ""major breakthrough"", saying a delegation led by Shah will visit the Indian hydropower projects at the Chenab Basin for an inspection between January 27 and February 1.

""It’s indeed a feather in [the] Ministry for water resources’ cap. We welcome this gesture from India and we expect the same spirit for resolution of other outstanding issues,"" the minister said in a series of tweets.

Vawda observed that Pakistan and India have been engaged in the dispute relating to IWT ""for ages"", but New Delhi had now agreed to schedule the visit of Pakistani experts ""due to our continued efforts"".

India had originally agreed to allow Pakistani experts to inspect the aforementioned two projects during the 115th meeting of the Permanent Commission for Indus Waters (PCIW) held between the two countries from August 29 to 30 in Lahore last year.

Besides agreeing to an inspection of the Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnal projects, which was scheduled for September, India had also consented to a survey by Pakistani experts of the Kishanganga project at Jhelum basin at a later stage. Reciprocally, Pakistan had agreed to allow India to carry out inspection of Kotri Barrage over the Indus after September.

After initially scheduling the inspection of the projects at Chenab Basin by Pakistani experts from October 7 to 11, New Delhi had postponed the same on the pretext of local bodies’ elections in the respective areas.

During the last week of October, the Pakistani Indus water commissioner had telephoned his Indian counterpart, Pradeep Kumar Saxena, and urged him to give a schedule for the experts' visit. However, Saxena then said it wouldn’t be possible during the first or second week of De­c­em­ber due to local Punchayat elections in Indian occupied Kashmir — the region where these projects are located.

After a reminder in November, Islamabad had on December 24 once again urged India through a letter to fulfil the commitment it made in August to schedule the hydropower projects' inspection by Pakistani experts.

Pakistan's objections

Pakistan has objections to the pondage and freeboard of Lower Kalnal, and pondage, filling criteria and spillway of Pakal Dul hydropower projects on Marusadar River — a right bank tributary of the Chenab.

Read: Pakistan's concerns regarding India's Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnal projects

Under the Indus Waters Treaty, both Pakistan and India are bound to inspect projects and share data related to water flow, storage and releases, and floods.

The treaty also empowers the two countries to mutually resolve their water related issues on their own or through arbitration and appointment of independent experts and other relevant forums.

220,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456891/mistrust-on-both-sides-needs-to-be-unwound-former-envoy-ali-siddiqui-on-pak-us-ties,"'Mistrust on both sides needs to be unwound': Former envoy Ali Siddiqui on Pak-US ties
",2019-01-11,"Former ambassador to the United States Ali Jahangir Siddiqui, who served in Washington from May-Dec 2018 ─ a period when Pak-US ties went from cold to frigid ─ spoke to Dawn about the complexities in relations between the two countries, the challenges he faced as an envoy, and whether Pakistan can contribute to normalcy in Afghanistan.

Siddiqui, who left Washington yesterday, told Dawn that he could have been more effectual serving a full three-year term, but maintained that he had contributed to an improvement in bilateral ties during his short seven-month tenure.

Q: How did America’s demand for Pakistan to do more impact bilateral ties?

Siddiqui: I cannot say whether they recognise that it was an unfair demand i.e. Pakistan had done a lot at a great cost to herself. But it is clear that the US South Asia strategy was not successful.

I think that Pakistan has gained from standing its ground. Of course, in the interim, there was a lot of pressure on the relationship but we sustained it.

Q: What do you believe is preventing Pak-US relations from taking off?

Siddiqui: The lack of clarity on both sides. Pakistan has not had broad-based strategic dialogue with the US for a long time and that has held things back.

But when we did have the strategic dialogue in the Obama years, that was precisely when the relationship was worsening rapidly. So, the problem is deeper than a structured engagement.

There is mistrust on both sides that needs to be unwound and that will take effort, whereby the leadership on both sides needs to be engaged by their respective diplomats and historical issues are discussed, and we clear and put the last 20 years of history behind us.

Q: The common perception is that both sides fail to understand each other. Instead of talking to each other, do they talk across each other?

Siddiqui: I don’t think this perception is correct. The bureaucracies on both sides are sophisticated. But the US political system has much more influence in its bureaucracy compared to ours ─ many US bureaucrats at the Assistant Secretary and higher levels are political appointees. So there is a strong political dimension in their system, which means that the direction that the US President wants is where the system goes.

Both sides have an understanding of each other and of their own historical positions. It is true that both sides don’t spend enough time understanding where the other is coming from and frequently miss the considerations and pressures the other side has to manage. From our foreign policy perspective, I would say that I observed that since we are busy dealing with short term issues and crises, there is limited long term policy planning at least vis a vis the US.

For example, an answer to the question 'Where do we want the Pak-US relationship to be in 15 years?' will dictate whether the next generations of our students will study in the US, whether our scientists will collaborate with US scientific institutions, whether our economy will have significant linkages to the US economy etc. The answer vis-a-vis China is clear, but with the US it is not so.

Q: Can Pakistan help create a semblance of normalcy in Afghanistan as the Americans demand?

Siddiqui: There is a lot of focus on Pakistan here but we have already done everything we can. We used every ounce of security and diplomatic goodwill we had to get all parties to the table.

The outcome of these talks will be determined by the Americans and the Afghan people, not Pakistan.

The Americans understand that and we are facilitating the process as best we can because not only is peace in Afghanistan a noble goal but Pakistan has been the second-worst sufferer in this conflict and we want a peaceful Afghanistan.

Q: Pakistanis often say that they want trade, not aid. Are they serious about it?

Siddiqui: I sometimes think that our policy planners missed something here. Trade not aid is quite dated, by some decades. The adage about teaching a man to fish, instead of giving him fish has been replaced by teaching a man to change fishing!

In the same way, trade not aid is no longer applicable. There is a role for aid, there is a role for trade, but with all the evolution in technology and other change in the world, we need to look for something new. Perhaps technology, not trade. Although I would repeat that trade and aid are both relevant.

Q: Pakistanis often boast about their strategic location, arguing that they cannot be ignored because of this. Was this strategic location an asset for you or an obstacle?

Siddiqui: Saying we have a strategic location, like saying we have a young population, is taking a one-sided position on what is a fact. A one-sided position, while correct on its own, ignores the disadvantages. A youthful population also means a struggle to get them employed while a strategic location means geopolitical complexity.

So, I dealt with our strategic location as a fact. Sometimes there were advantages and other times there was complexity. But all complexity is an opportunity to clear matters. For example, we were caught up in the US-China competition as a result of our strategic location, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and closeness to China.

There were statements made both on Capitol Hill and by the US administration that money Pakistan may get from the International Monetary Fund may end up repaying China but we have been successful in explaining to all US departments of government and this is not how IMF and our loans to China are structured.

Having dealt with this complexity due to our strategic location, we have created a better understanding of Pakistan and our positions with these stakeholders.

Q: Do you think your performance would have been better if you had a full term? Would you like to return with a full term?

Siddiqui: Of course. Diplomatic results are a function of skills and time. If I had three years rather than seven months, we would have achieved 10 times the results.

I’m not being simplistic as its not linear. It takes time to build relationships and access and, in the end, Washington, like Islamabad is a small town. There are a few hundred relevant people in leadership and they are split between the White House, Congress, departments of government, the security establishment, business, scientific establishment etc.

We have lost a lot of ground over the last two decades and more hard work and time are what is needed to regain it.

As for me, I haven’t given much thought to returning if ever offered. I spent 18 months in government between Islamabad and Washington at great personal cost in terms of opportunity, family life etc. My wife Saira has been a pillar of support both in going along with my transition to government and in her capacity as the wife of an ambassador, particularly in Washington where the spouse has a major role in diplomacy. So, it would have to be a 'team-decision'!",Anwar Iqbal,"['former', 'ambassador', 'united', 'states', 'ali', 'jahangir', 'siddiqui', 'served', 'washington', 'maydec', '2018', 'period', 'pakus',

221,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456886/will-not-let-asghar-khans-efforts-go-to-waste-sc-decides-against-closing-2012-case,"'Will not let Asghar Khan's efforts go to waste': SC decides against closing 2012 case
",2019-01-11,"The Supreme Court on Friday, a day after the family of late Air Marshal Asghar Khan opposed the closure of a case related to financial scams of the 1990s, summoned the defence secretary to apprise it of the status of cases against army officers allegedly involved in the case.

The apex court had notified Khan's heirs after the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) last month suggested that the case relating to the implementation of the 2012 verdict be closed since the authorities did not have enough evidence to launch a criminal prosecution against the individuals named in the judgement of the apex court.

In 1996, Asghar Khan had filed a human rights petition in the SC, accusing the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of doling out money to a group of politicians in the 1990s.

The case was initiated by the air marshal after Benazir Bhutto's interior minister, retired general Naseerullah Babar, had claimed in the National Assembly in 1994 that the ISI had disbursed funds to ""purchase"" the loyalty of politicians and public figures so as to manipulate the 1990 elections, form the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), and bring about the defeat of the PPP.

Sixteen years after the petition was filed, the SC in its judgement — penned by then chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry — ruled that the 1990 general elections had been polluted by dishing out Rs140m to a particular group of politicians only to deprive the people of being represented by their chosen representatives.

According to the FIA report, 18 politicians in their statements submitted in the SC denied receiving the funds to allegedly manipulate the 1990 polls.

The agency has contended that the statements of witnesses recorded in the case so far had gaps and did not correlate with each other. Moreover, the investigation agency has also remained unsuccessful in securing financial records from the relevant banks since the matter is 24 years old.

Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, while hearing the case today, questioned how the court could just dismiss its decision. ""We will get further investigation done,"" he asserted, adding that Salman Akram Raja would assist the court.

""How can this case proceed?"" he asked. ""A verdict has already been announced, but look what's happening now, when it is time for implementation.""

Justice Nisar recalled that it had been suggested ""that some individuals should be separated from the case"".

""That should not happen,"" Raja said. ""A man has said 'I have distributed the money',"" he pointed out.

""We will not let Asghar Khan's efforts go to waste,"" Justice Nisar asserted. ""The Asghar Khan family was not taken into confidence over the suggestion that the case be closed. If the FIA lacked the authority, it could have gotten the investigation done by another institution,"" the chief justice added.

""When the verdict was announced, I met then-chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry,"" the top judge recounted. ""I said to Chaudhry that he had announced such a massive verdict that if the court now does nothing more, even that was enough.""

""The Asghar Khan and Asia Bibi case verdicts are historical,"" Raja commented.

""A military court is trying the army officers who were involved. There is a separate trial against civilians,"" the chief justice said. ""The cabinet had said that a military court would try them (army officers). How can we reach a final conclusion after separate investigations?"" he wondered.

""We don't know what action the military has taken so far, why not summon a report from them too?"" he suggested.

""Don't get the impression that the military is beyond the jurisdiction of this court,"" Justice Nisar said. ""As the chief justice, I would like to tell them that all this is within our jurisdiction.""

""Why don't we summon the defence secretary?"" he suggested.

The court in today's hearing decided that it was not satisfied with the conclusions reached by the FIA and asked the agency to submit a response to Khan's family's joint reply.

The SC also ordered that a notice be sent to the defence secretary and asked him to apprise the court on which army officer's cases were sent to military courts and what progress had been made in the investigation. The court ordered the reply to be submitted in a week and adjourned the case until Jan 25.",Haseeb Bhatti,"['supreme', 'court', 'friday', 'day', 'family', 'late', 'air', 'marshal', 'asghar', 'khan', 'opposed', 'closure', 'case', 'related', 'financial', 'scams', '1990s', 'summoned', 'defence', 'secretary', 'apprise', 'status', 'cases', 'army', 'officers', 'allegedly', 'involved', 'case', 'apex', 'court', 'notified', 'khan', 'heirs', 'federal', 'investigation', 'agency', 'fia', 'last', 'month', 'suggested', 'case', 'relating', 'implementation', '2012', 'verdict', 'closed', 'since', 'authorities', 'enough', 'evidence', 'launch', 'criminal', 'prosecution', 'individuals', 'named', 'judgement', 'apex', 'court', '1996', 'asghar', 'khan', 'filed', 'human', 'rights', 'petition', 'sc', 'accusing', 'interservices', 'intelligence', 'isi', 'doling', 'money', 'group', 'politicians', '1990s', 'case', 'initiated', 'air', 'marshal', 'benazir', 'bhutto', 'interior', 'minister', 'retired', 'general', 'naseerullah', 'babar', 'claimed', 'national', 'assembly', '1994', 'isi', 'disbursed', 'funds', 'purchase', 'loyalty', 'politicians', 'public', 'figures', 'manipulate', '1990', 'elections', 'form', 'islami', 'jamhoori', 'ittehad', 'iji', 'bring', 'defeat', 'ppp', 'sixteen', 'years', 'petition', 'filed', 'sc', 'judgement', 'penned', 'chief', 'justice', 'iftikhar', 'chaudhry', 'ruled', '1990', 'general', 'elections', 'polluted', 'dishing', 'rs140m', 'particular', 'group', 'politicians', 'deprive', 'people', 'represented', 'chosen', 'representatives', 'according', 'fia', 'report', '18', 'politicians', 'statements', 'submitted', 'sc', 'denied', 'receiving', 'funds', 'allegedly', 'manipulate', '1990', 'polls', 'agency', 'contended', 'statements', 'witnesses', 'recorded', 'case', 'far', 'gaps', 'correlate', 'moreover', 'investigation', 'agency', 'also', 'remained', 'unsuccessful', 'securing', 'financial', 'records', 'relevant', 'banks', 'since', 'matter', '24', 'years', 'old', 'chief', 'justice', 'pakistan', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'hearing', 'case', 'today', 'questioned', 'court', 'could', 'dismiss', 'decision', 'get', 'investigation', 'done', 'asserted', 'adding', 'salman', 'akram', 'raja', 'would', 'assist', 'court', 'case', 'proceed', 'asked', 'verdict', 'already', 'announced', 'look', 'happening', 'time', 'implementation', 'justice', 'nisar', 'recalled', 'suggested', 'individuals', 'separated', 'case', 'happen', 'raja', 'said', 'man', 'said', 'distributed', 'money', 'pointed', 'let', 'asghar', 'khan', 'efforts', 'go', 'waste', 'justice', 'nisar', 'asserted', 'asghar', 'khan', 'family', 'taken', 'confidence', 'suggestion', 'case', 'closed', 'fia', 'lacked', 'authority', 'could', 'gotten', 'investigation', 'done', 'another', 'institution', 'chief', 'justice', 'added', 'verdict', 'announced', 'met', 'thenchief', 'justice', 'iftikhar', 'chaudhry', 'top', 'judge', 'recounted', 'said', 'chaudhry', 'announced', 'massive', 'verdict', 'court', 'nothing', 'even', 'enough', 'asghar', 'khan', 'asia', 'bibi', 'case', 'verdicts', 'historical', 'raja', 'commented', 'military', 'court', 'trying', 'army', 'officers', 'involved', 'separate', 'trial', 'civilians', 'chief', 'justice', 'said', 'cabinet', 'said', 'military', 'court', 'would', 'try', 'army', 'officers', 'reach', 'final', 'conclusion', 'separate', 'investigations', 'wondered', 'nt', 'know', 'action', 'military', 'taken', 'far', 'summon', 'report', 'suggested', 'nt', 'get', 'impression', 'military', 'beyond', 'jurisdiction', 'court', 'justice', 'nisar', 'said', 'chief', 'justice', 'would', 'like', 'tell', 'within', 'jurisdiction', 'nt', 'summon', 'defence', 'secretary', 'suggested', 'court', 'today', 'hearing', 'decided', 'satisfied', 'conclusions', 'reached', 'fia', 'asked', 'agency', 'submit', 'response', 'khan', 'family', 'joint', 'reply', 'sc', 'also', 'ordered', 'notice', 'sent', 'defence', 'secretary', 'asked', 'apprise', 'court', 'army', 'officer', 'cases', 'sent', 'military', 'courts', 'progress', 'made', 'investigation', 'court', 'ordered', 'reply', 'submitted', 'week', 'adjourned', 'case', 'jan', '25']","['let', 'asghar', 'khan', 'efforts', 'go', 'waste', 'sc', 'decides', 'closing', '2012', 'case']"

This offer was made in a message of the prime minister conveyed to the Sindh chief minister by Prime Minister’s Task Force on Housing chairman Zaigham Rizvi during his meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah here at CM House.

Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly Firdous Shamim Naqvi and Adviser to the Chief Minister Murtaza Wahab were also present in the meeting.

It's Karachi Eat time!

The popular food fest is taking place over the weekend from January 11-13 at the Beach Park on Edhi Avenue, Sea View. The ticket costs Rs300 of which Rs100 are redeemable.

This time, the organisers have exercised quite a bit of quality control, whittling down their list of 400 applicants to 95 stalls.

Karachi Eat organiser Omar Omari says, ""We asked all applicants to submit a form (of Rs4,000 which was then given to charity) and one unique Karachi Eat special dish which was then judged by a series of jury members from celebrities, bloggers and journalists. We did over 400 tastings and narrowed it down to 95 new entries or Karachi Eat Specials - which we're calling them - we've also shared on social media.""

That wasn't the only change Omari's brought to Eat: Karachi Eat's venue has changed from last year's Benazir Bhutto Park to Beach Park for logistical reasons. ""Benazir Bhutto Shahid park has lots of bushes, which form corridors that restrict flow of traffic. That was becoming a little bit of a challenge for us. Also the fact that it's a step lower on one side so the stalls cannot be accommodated,"" says Omari.

Talking about the parking situation, Omari shares, ""Parking this time around should be a lot, lot better because this park has a ton of space behind it which you can see in the pictures on our Facebook page. We’ve levelled the entire area, cordoned it off and we have regulated parking there so I think as far as this is concerned, I think it’s a better arrangement than ever before.""

Apart from the food, expect the following attractions: ""We've got a huge play area. like a mini theme park by AA Joyland. We're bringing in artists, but not anybody large scale as this year. We're going in-line with our approach to our festival, which is about bringing in new talent and new restaurants, so we're doing the same with our artists, and we've got a lot of underground bands: Tamasha, Kashmir, Jamberoo and one of the larger brands RDB.""

Without further ado, here are 20 new stalls we're looking forward to feasting at...

What's on the menu: We're selling three different types of pizzas; 5 Cheese Margerita (made with artisanal cheese from Karacheese), Smoked Chicken and Beef Pepperoni.

Goal for Karachi Eat: Our brand (not being an NGO) is the first of its kind at Karachi Eat to donate all profits to charity. Our main goal is to create awareness that a festival can be used for a social cause. The aim has never been just about selling good food but to make an impact and also sell a good product.

This year Pizza L'Oven is contributing to Baldia School of Champions - which provides education to children from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds - and we're coming up with ideas on how to utilise the money best for the students; like introducing them to YouTube and Skype for tutorials by people from all over Pakistan.

Future plans: We hope we can inspire people/vendors to use festivals as a platform to sell good food and pair it with a good cause.

What's on the menu: The menu is extensive with seven to eight items. There will probably be a different menu everyday. We have the St. Honoré cake, a French dessert - our brand name is also inspired by this dessert, it's a traditional wedding cake of French origin and we're doing a smaller version of it for KE.

We're also doing brioche buns, it's a french bread, very soft and rich. We're introducing two types of brioche buns - sweet and savoury. The third item is a surprise. It's an expensive dessert but we will try to introduce just a few pieces since we have to cap the price at Rs300, we're probably bringing it on Friday. There are some cakes, cookies, shot glass desserts, our brand is known for the best macarons in town, so our stall will have lots of macarons.

Goal for Karachi Eat: I wanted to be a part of it and I went for it.

Future plans: I'm not sure if I want to have an outlet yet, maybe two years down the road I may have a small outlet. But I plan on teaching french pâtisserie to young aspiring bakers.

What's on the menu: We'll be serving Chicken and Beef Khaosuey, Singaporean rice and our star entree for the festival Malpura Madness which is not part of our regular menu.

Goal for Karachi Eat: KE will definitely be a step forward for us given that we have been operating from home for three years. This will be our first public appearance where we will be serving live.

Future plans: We believe it may be a game changer for us and will take us to the next level.

What's on the menu: We’re serving three sliders; the Level 1 slider is a mince, beef patty topped with our secret Boss Sauce and a pickle; The Boss is a premium, imported Wagyu beef patty topped with Gouda cheese, our secret Boss Sauce and a pickle, and lastly our Flamin' Chic Magnet is a juicy, deep-fried chicken thigh coated in crushed Flamin' Hot Cheetos, topped with jalapeño cheese and chopped jalapeños. All of the above are served on a bed of lettuce in a fresh potato roll.

We are also serving extra crunchy, Belgian french fries which go really well with our Boss Sauce.

Goal for Karachi Eat: We’re just a group of friends who started making sliders for fun and realised that a lot of people were really enjoying them. So we just hope to have some fun together by spreading our love for food with Karachi and seeing what the response is.

Future plans: We plan on taking orders for events in the future and then seeing how we go from there.

What's on the menu: Two varieties of Spanish churros: glazed (in the traditional Spanish style) and iced (served with soft serve ice cream). Owner Farrukh promises that his churros are made with the same machinery and technology as those he's tried abroad and so taste ""about 95%"" the same.

Goal for Karachi Eat: Farrukh says he wants to reach as many people as possible ans also spread awareness about what ""real churros taste like"". We've seen churros been made with syringe technology, which is not hygienic. We're introducing proper technology.

Future plans: Churrosity's outlet will open at Delawala Clifton in 10 days time and will offer centre-filled, topped and iced variants.

What's on the menu: We're serving flavoured candy floss. Five flavours made with Jolly Rancher hard candy; grape, watermelon, cherry, blue-raspberry and green apple, and two regular flavours mint and coffee. We also have two ice cream flavours, lemon and paan.

Goal for Karachi Eat: Most of our competition deals with chocolates, cookies and brownies, we tried to go for cotton candy, we feel it's an untapped market and many of us grew up eating candy floss, so we're hoping to bring back the taste.

Future plans: Karachi Eat has always been a platform for food vendors and our main aim is to make people aware of our brand.

What's on the menu: Crepes in five flavours, including Ferrero Rocher, Banana Caramel, Chicken Mushroom and Peppers, Mexican and Strawberry and Banana Split (which is a Karachi Eat special!).

Goal for Karachi Eat: Owner Jasir says when he started the brand with the idea of making crepes more accessible to the general public. At Karachi Eat, he hopes a greater number of people get to try his crepes. ""I want more people to have a taste of France,"" he says with the hope that Karachiites become more open to trying different cuisines.

Future plans: The Crepery will continue serving and delivering its delicious crepes from the Chotu Chaiwala at Bukhari and Bahadurabad as well as its catering operations.

What's on the menu: Our menu for Karachi Eat is beef chapli kebab, beef biryani, chicken malai boti roll, chicken bihari roll and peri bites.

Goal for Karachi Eat: To build rapport with the Karachi audience

Future plans: To increase our presence internationally and locally with the pride of our nation.

Chatoora

What's on the menu:Dahi bara burgers (!!!), aloo bun kebabs, kuliyas (that is, boiled potato pockets) and an assortment of regular items like mixed chaat, pani puri, methi puri, fries, chai, coffee and drinks!

Goal for Karachi Eat: Abdul Wasif says that in the past two years, he's been supplying other stalls at Karachi Eat with the masalas for staple items like pani puri and kuliya chaat. Based on their success, he decided to establish his own brand. ""So many people contacted me to supply them this year but I turned them all down,"" he says.

Future plans: Chatoora currently has a stall at Park Towers but he hopes to launch an outlet soon. Show him some love, peeps!

What's on the menu: Icecream sandwiches in three flavours — Big Chip (chocolate chip cookies with vanilla icecream), Caramelt (brownie cookies with salted caramel icecream) and Funfetti (confetti-filled sugar cookies with chocolate icecream in the middle). Owners Daniya and Abdul Wahab promise that the cookies will be freshly baked and the sandwiches assembled on the spot.

Goal for Karachi Eat: Daniya says that she's testing out her products for the first time at Karachi Eat.

Future plans: After Karachi Eat, Daniya will set about to developing more flavours and hopes to open an icecream sandwich bar soon. ""I want customers to be able to choose their own base, pick their flavour of icecream and we'll put it together for them. This level of customisability could get messy at Karachi Eat but this is my vision for the future,"" says Daniya.

What's on the menu: Korean style fried chicken, traditional Cuban sandwiches called cubanos... and Butter Beer (yep, the drink Harry Potter and his friends loved!)

Goal for Karachi Eat: Test the Karachi market for readiness for customised sodas and coffees on tap.

Future plans: We want to continue our food pop ups after Karachi Eat and don't want to be associated with any one particular product.

What's on the menu: Beef and chicken tantuni, which are Turkish wraps. Plus: Turkish coffee that is prepared in sand and ayran, which is a Turkish lassi. ayran is traditionally salty but TH is serving a sweet variant to suit local preferences.

Goal for Karachi Eat: Test out the brand and use the popularity momentum to open a physical space.

Future plans: Tantuni House will open in a physical location this year or the next.

What's on the menu: Stuffed naans in three flavours: Dum Ka Keema, Nutella Oreo and Smokin' Chick (coal-smoked chicken). The latter flavour is a Karachi Eat special.

Goal for Karachi Eat: Karachi Eat will be our first ever event. Every brand wants to do business but we also want to use this opportunity to market ourselves and create more brand awareness. We look forward ot connect with new prospective customers.

Future plans: We make our naans in a brick oven, which isn't portable. For Karachi Eat, we've had built a huge portable oven that will enable us to do more events in the future. We hope to participate in food festivals across the country.

What's on the menu: Street food from around the world, including Beef BBQ from Nigeria, Chicken Sovlaki from Greece, Simple Sweet Brandy Snap Bowl and Cucumber Lemonade. Watch out for some surprise items!

Goal for Karachi Eat: Yasir Bil says that with Om Nom Bros they're trying to make a little spot in the market for street food from all over the world.

Future plans: In a couple of months, Om Nom Bros will open a cafe with a rotating menu that will offer ""something new, different and always unique.""

What's on the menu: Red Chili Tacos

Goal for Karachi Eat: This is our first time here and we're preparing for the big rush ahead. I wasn't aware of the magnitude of people who attend Karachi Eat so we've been prepping since last week to get in the flow.

Future plans: We're hoping our debut at Karachi Eat would lead to more people enjoying what we have to offer.

What's on the menu: Cronuts and live Eclairs station along with many desserts.

Goal for Karachi Eat: We have been working on the perfect cronut recipe for a while now and we want to launch it at Karachi Eat. Our cronuts have a ganache filling and have been well received by those who tried them so far. We also have a live eclairs station where you can build an eclair in three easy steps. Knowing the rush at Karachi Eat we've been practicing the assembly line for quite a few days now and are confident we'll do it well there.

Future plans: We're hoping to add the cronut to our menu after launching it at Karachi Eat and keeping it there as a permanent choice.

What's on the menu: Soups, chicken lollipops, Dynamite Chicken, Peri hot chicken balls and Dhaka Chicken.

Goal for Karachi Eat: More brand recognition and we hope to build direct relationships with our customers because currently we are only doing delivery and catering otherwise.

Future plans: We want to expand our branches all across Pakistan.

What's on the menu: We have designed our menu based on our best sellers and an exclusive entree for Karachi Eat 2019, sliders in two flavours (Teriyaki Chicken and Smoky Beef), Pizza Sandwich, BBQ Wings and Beef Chilli Cheese Fries.

Goal for Karachi Eat: We are hoping that Karachi Eat will give us mileage and create further awareness of our brand enhancing our customer base. Further, we are hoping that people get to know about the distinguished taste and quality we have to offer in a highly competitive fast food market.

Future plans: Our short term plan is to build a brand that people are familiar with, can relate to easily and trust with consistent quality food. Our long term plan is to expand into a franchise system and generate enough funds to reach out and help our underprivileged community by donating to school and colleges.

What's on the menu: Numerous gelatos, including an all new Ferrero Rocher gelato.

Goal for Karachi Eat: This is the first time we are participating at Karachi Eat and we are very excited for the biggest festival in the city. Our gelatos, even when inspired from popular candy bars, are made in house, with every ingredient made from scratch and we want people to try them out and enjoy them as much as we enjoy making them.

Future plans: We're hoping to expand Amiamo and have a few more branches, so that more people can try our authentic gelatos.

What's on the menu: Corn Dogs(Flaming Dog/Hotrod), Pulled beef burger Camper'roni Classic, Bolognese Fries, Falafel Wrap and Mushroom Drive.

Goal for Karachi Eat: Karachi Eat is huge for us as we are the newest amongst all eateries. And, we are only a delivery joint serving in selected areas atm. Through Eat we wish to serve to a larger audience i.e the entire Karachi and bring flavoursome food to them.

Future plans: We plan to launch our high end VW themed restaurant this year which would revive the love for Volkswagen beetles and would make it easier for everyone to visit and taste our heavenly

224,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456882/a-safe-basant-is-an-unrealistic-target-in-so-many-ways,"A safe Basant is an unrealistic target in so many ways
",2019-01-11,"THE PTI’s journey from being viewed as good-looking JI to increasingly been suspected as a more forward-looking PPP has had its own strange pitfalls.

One of them certainly has been Fayyazul Hassan Chohan: recovering from bashing the bold actresses of the Lahore stage to suddenly declaring that the city will celebrate Basant this year in the second weekend of February, as was the case before the festival was banned.

The announcement had the typical ministerial sense of finality about it, and was bound to strike a chord with all those who have not quite been able to shrug Basant off as a critically unwanted affliction, despite the pile of evidence that paints the festival as not just undesirable but evil. It is a measure of the influence the kite-flying event has on people that crowds of enthusiasts are still compelled to fight great odds to somehow retrieve their beloved Basant. They are unlikely to succeed, however.

A petition in court challenging the ‘revival’ of Basant argues that it would be against the law of the land. Some old theories based on legal, social and religious viewpoints have also been hurriedly put on display for another quick inspection by all those interested in the revival debate. The biggest factor impeding the return of the frenetic and uplifting kite-flying circus has also made an appearance.

It is a measure of its influence that enthusiasts are still compelled to fight great odds to somehow retrieve their beloved Basant.

There are reports of the killer string looming, which had caused the ouster of Basant from Lahore’s cultural calendar in the first place, to prey on new victims. A few important lives have been reported lost in string-related instances in the city. This is going to weigh heavily on the conscience of even the most ardent and adamant of Lahore’s residents, who were otherwise ready to climb up to their kothas or rooftops with basketfuls of the instruments of merriment that made the erstwhile Basant truly irresistible.

Even at peak-time, the festival demanded certain extended stretches of indifference from those who could not but let themselves go with the direction of the wind on the day. Certain precautions were necessary, and a definite few things were to be strictly avoided to prevent the experience from turning sour.

First and foremost, the average Basant enthusiast was to (at all times) stay clear of the path of kite-flying players and maestros, who were too elitist and too skilled to waste their energies in the loud expressions and entanglements that Basant so unabashedly exhibited. A player was always to be distinguished from your ordinary kite flyer.

In fact, with time, the louder the fanfare became, the deeper the proud players withdrew into their exclusive spaces, in an effort to totally shut out the utter madness surrounding them.

These players — or those among them who remain — have a grudge against the rapid popularisation of Basant, which eventually generated high business interests and led to what is often referred to as the crass commercialisation of a once very affordable event. And the charm worked, as you could very well tell by the colours that sprouted from everywhere on Basant day, attracting to a gay Lahore all kinds of souls — from those who wanted only but a small chunk in the profit from the activities, to those who were out to exploit the occasion to paint a positive image of the country.

The old players would tell you that, while they never approved of Basant, the new interest shown by businesses and those looking to spruce up the Pakistani image caused irreparable damage to a sport they were so much in love with: It hastened the demise of kite-flying in the city and in the whole of Punjab. Not that their dreams appear likely to be realised in this life, but they would rather forego the festival for the pleasure of a few quiet battles or paichs in the sky, in some remote corner, far removed from the public gaze. They have little to extract from a one-day Basant.

Another Basant ritual required the old revellers of the event to not read the headlines in the next day’s paper. These news items invariably screamed about the loss of life — as well as of property — caused by the wayward lot who, a day earlier, had taken to their roofs to proclaim a war on norms of decent entertainment. For many days, those carrying the scars of their Basant battles on their fingers would feel pangs of guilt as they were subjected to all kind of accusations by friends and family who insisted that, after all, there was a point at which the price of a habit or a passion cannot be sustained and had to be given up.

There was always this counter-theory that said you cannot simply discard an event like that. But, quite simply, not enough could be done to free the sport from the demons hidden within. Meanwhile, there were other areas where efforts to contain and minimise loss of life had borne fruit. For instance, it was once considered inevitable that a general election would lead to violence and casualties. But, with time, this trend was arrested. Now, the newspaper on the morning after the polls looked so much more… well... much more civilised compared to the past. Clearly, not enough was being done to make Basant safer as well, with the desire for greater thrills introducing the revellers to newer, deadly variants of the old kite string.

A safe Basant is an unrealistic target in so many ways. One thing is for certain, though: There can be no restoration here. If Basant ever returns to the stage, it will be as an altogether new festival, built on the ashes of the one we had before. The original died many years ago, and in it were elements that precluded it from ever being resurrected again. As compensation, you might want to name this new invention — if it ever comes about — as ‘Basant’. So strong is the case against the kite-flying festival.

225,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456881/editorial-firing-the-gas-mds-is-a-recipe-for-demoralisation,"Editorial: Firing the gas MDs is a recipe for demoralisation
",2019-01-11,"HOW do we make sense of the prime minister’s decision to order the firing of the managing directors of the two gas distribution companies? On the face of it, assigning blame to the MDs of the gas distribution companies appears odd, given that they are not responsible for the production of gas or for its import.

Besides, they neither draw up the merit order list nor do they decide how the pace of the expansion of gas demand is to be regulated. Their role is simply to run the gas distribution system.

If there is a shortage of gas in the system, or if there is a technical outage at some point that is going to constrict the supply of gas, this information is available to authorities in the federal government in real time.

At least four officials in Islamabad, with offices very close to each other — the secretaries for power and petroleum as well as the ministers of these respective divisions — have in their offices screens displaying real-time data on how much gas is in the system, how the fields are functioning, how the distribution system is operating, and so on.

With all this readily available information, it is difficult to comprehend how blame was assigned to the very last link in the gas supply chain: the heads of the two distribution companies.

Ever since the country’s gas shortages began to bite with the onset of winter, the government ordered an inquiry first by the sector regulator, Ogra, followed by another by the secretary petroleum. The reason for the two inquiries was that the assessment of the first revealed that there was no blame to be assigned, since the situation was as to be expected given the supply and demand gap.

Dissatisfied with this, the government ordered a second inquiry, which also came back inconclusive regarding the question of censure. This was followed by the rather sudden news that two individuals, the least likely culprits by all assessments, have had the blame pinned upon them.

What may have been intended as a sign of strong leadership is, in fact, quite the contrary. It instead signals that the petroleum division has been left to its own devices, and that when things go wrong — as they inevitably will without top-level coordination — a game begins to make a scapegoat of the most readily available party.

This is a recipe for demoralisation. Strong leadership requires creating and strengthening the systems that enable accurate forecasting of gas demand, particularly in the winter months, and smooth arrangements for supply, including placing advance orders for LNG vessels in the correct quantity. The work is complex, and it requires the petroleum division to work with the power division (where a significant bulk of gas demand originates). System building is the need of the hour, not a blame game.

226,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456880/editorial-pemras-guidelines-suggest-interest-in-moral-policing-rather-than-promoting-local-industry,"Editorial: Pemra's guidelines suggest interest in moral policing rather than promoting local industry
",2019-01-11,"THE culture wars appear to be heating up once again as regulators and the superior judiciary wade awkwardly into the realm of media content monitoring and censorship.

The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority has issued a flurry of advisories and warnings to TV channels recently that have focused on the alleged erosion of traditional values and Pakistani culture caused by the broadcasting of so-called inappropriate and culturally insensitive entertainment content. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has asserted that Indian content on Pakistani TV channels undermines Pakistani culture and therefore should not be allowed to air locally.

The interventions by Pemra and the superior judiciary have once again put a spotlight on a complex set of issues: the rights of media creators and distributors versus the sentiments of some media consumers; the imposition of a monolithic state-approved culture in a reasonably diverse society; and moral policing versus upholding the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights of the people.

At the outset, what is troubling about Pemra’s interventions is that they appear to be arbitrary and subject to the whims of the regulator rather than a consistent enforcement of rules and norms that have been rigorously and transparently evaluated.

Explore: Who defines obscenity?

Pemra has a viewer feedback and complaint management system on its website. For the month of December 2018, complaints against 41 satellite TV channels are listed: nearly half the channels have a single complaint lodged against them, while the highest number of complaints registered against a single channel is 22.

While Pemra may not have to wait for viewer complaints, it is striking that censorship measures are being taken in the name of viewers while there is little evidence of mass grievances on its own online system. Moreover, the mere registration of a complaint is not automatically an indication of a legitimate objection.

Pemra’s recent guidelines suggest an interest in moral policing rather than promoting a vibrant, popular and commercially successful local broadcast entertainment industry.

It is also unclear how this country’s TV channels, owned, managed and consumed by Pakistanis, could be undermining its culture — are Pemra’s anonymous bureaucrats and technocrats really the arbiters and custodians of local culture?

Perhaps most striking is that Pemra appears to believe it is operating in a vacuum. In an age where Pakistanis are rushing online and where Indian movies dominate the cinema experience, is Pemra protecting consumers more than it is hurting freedom of choice and commercial creators?

A reassessment is needed.

",2019-01-11,"GILGIT: Relatives and other residents blocked a major road and ransacked a government hospital in Chilas town over the death of a heart patient alleging delay in treatment.

The police said Saeed Alam, a 50-year-old resident of Shaheen area, was taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, Diamer, on Thursday morning after he complained about a heart attack, but he didn’t survive.

Relatives of the deceased accompanied by residents later ransacked the hospital alleging that delay in treatment caused the patient’s death.

They later placed the body on a major road, burned old tyres and staged a sit-in shouting slogans against doctors and health department.

The protesters alleged that when the patient was taken to the hospital, no doctor was there.

Haji Akbar, Abdul Rehman, Maulana Saja and other speakers demanded strict action against the hospital employees responsible for death.

The protesters stayed put for six hours and went away after the administration held talks with them.

Meanwhile, the doctors boycotted outpatient departments in Chilas town’s hospitals over the mob attack and harassment.

They claimed that the patient had died of the negligence of relatives and not doctors’.

The doctors insisted that the relatives were advised three days ago to take the heart patient to a modern city without delay for treatment, but they didn’t act accordingly.

They demanded protection for their community’s members.

Patients complained that the strike inconvenienced them.

",2019-01-11,"PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench on Thursday disposed of a writ petition filed by former MNA retired captain Mohammad Safdar with the direction to National Accountability Bureau, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, not to arrest him without issuance of an arrest warrants in any inquiry against him.

The bench comprising Justice Roohul Amin Khan Chamkani and Justice Mohammad Ayub also directed the petitioner, Mr Safdar, who is son-in-law of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, to appear before NAB, if required, in any of the inquiries against him.

Mr Safdar had moved the court apprehending his arrest by the NAB with the request to issue directives to the bureau not to arrest him without legal proceedings.

Barrister Mudassir Amir appeared for the petitioner and contended that his client had frequently been issued call-up notices by the bureau.

He pointed out that the petitioner had appeared in October last year before a team of NAB in an inquiry pertaining to alleged misuse of authority when he was MNA from NA-2, Manshera.

He stated that the NAB had normally now been arresting suspects after asking them to appear in connection with any inquiry through a call-up notice without issuance of arrest warrants.

He contended that the Supreme Court in one of the judgments had pronounced that the arrest warrants should be issued by the NAB at least 10 days before arresting a suspect.

Deputy prosecutor general of NAB, Mohammad Jamil, stated that despite issuance of call-up notices Mr Safdar had not been appearing before the NAB’s team in an inquiry pertaining to his assets, which were apparently disproportionate to his known sources of income.

He contended that the petitioner would never be arrested in illegal manner.

",2019-01-11,"PESHAWAR: Chief of his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Thursday said Pakistan was being called a ‘battleground’ between China and America due to the wrong policies of the government.

“Regrettably, our country is being called a battlefield between China and US,” Mr Fazl told a condolence reference held for the party’s provincial chief and parliamentarian, Maulana Amanullah Khan, here.

Awami National Party central general secretary Mian Iftikhar Hussain, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz provincial president Amir Muqam, Jamaat-i-Islami provincial chief and Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, Pakistan People’s Party provincial president Humayun Khan, Qaumi Watan Party general secretary Hashim Babar, JUI-F general secretary Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri and leaders of other parties also spoke on the occasion.

Fazl claims PTI govt wasted over $35bn Chinese investment to please US

The speakers paid rich tribute to the deceased and eulogised his struggle for democracy and religion.

Coming down heavily on the ruling PTI over its policies, the JUI-F chief said the government had wasted over $35 billion Chinese investment to get the US blessings.

He said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project was a game changer for the country but the government made it controversial and that the government was safeguarding the interests of the US and Jewish lobby.

Mr Fazl said former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was declared a friend of his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, while the sitting prime minister was talking about peace and friendship with the country’s archrival.

He said despite the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, the government received a cold response from New Delhi, who had rejected the offer of talks and friendship.

The JUI-F chief said the National Accountability Bureau was being used as a tool to victimise political opponents of the government.

He said the PTI had abolished its own Ehtesab Commission in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Mr Fazl said his party had demanded the abolition of the NAB during discussion on 18th Constitutional Amendment in 2010 but the PPP and PML-N did not support the demand.

“Now, let these two parties bear the consequences,” he said in a lighter vein.

The JUI-F chief said parliament could do away with the NAB if the KP government amended the law to abolish the Ehtesab Commission.

He said military ruler Pervez Musharraf had created NAB to blackmail politicians and that he had opposed the move at that time, too.

Mr Fazl said a group of corrupt elements could not hold fair accountability of others.

He said his party was fighting to liberate the country from foreign powers and their agents.

“We will take our fight to its logical end to get real freedom,” he said adding that the successive governments did not make decisions independently and were dictated by foreign powers.

He said the supremacy of the Constitution would bring social, political and economic stability in the country.

The JUI-F chief said foreign agents were trying to distort the image of Pakistan.

He alleged that Britain continued to treat Pakistan as its colony and that the acquittal of Christian woman Asia Bibi in a blasphemy case proved his apprehension in that respect.

Addressing the reference, ANP leader Main Iftikhar Hussain alleged that the establishment was patronising Prime Minister Imran Khan.

He said the PTI government would collapse in the centre if the establishment withdrew its support.

The ANP leader called for unity among opposition parties, especially PPP and PML-N.

He said all corrupt men had joined the PTI to protect their ill-gotten wealth and political careers.

Mr Hussain said Premier Imran Khan had been installed to bring changes to the 18th Constitutional Amendment.

He demanded more autonomy for provinces to strengthen federation instead of the rollback if the 18th Amendment.

The ANP leader urged Pakistan, big powers and other neighbours to play their role for the political settlement of the Afghan issue.

He said neighbours and big powers should not waste the ‘golden opportunity’ to end war in Afghanistan as the US had given clear indication of withdrawing its forces from the war-torn country.

Mr Hussain also appealed to Maulana Fazl and Asfandyar Wali to use their influence to pave the way for a peaceful solution of Afghan war.

",2019-01-11,"ISLAMABAD: Civil society groups campaigning against smoking on Thursday presented a new tobacco tax reforms model, and decried the tax collecting body for surrendering to the multinational cigarette manufacturers.

The new taxation model was presented by Malik Imran Ahmad belonging to ‘Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids’ in collaboration with Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC), Human Development Foundation (HDF) and Pakistan National Heart Association (PANAH).

The proposals included demand from the government to implement crucial measures to further strengthen the tax system, regularly increase the excise duty to reduce cigarette affordability, harmonise all taxes across tobacco products and fully implement the international protocol to eliminate illicit tobacco trade.

Malik Imran said the tax reforms model will also contribute to reduction in adult cigarette consumption by about 2.15pc from 10.4pc among adults in the next three years.

The civil society members predicted that the tax reforms were expected to generate an additional amount of Rs205.9 billion in over three years.

Meanwhile, talking to media Malik Imran blamed fall in revenue collections on Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) which benefitted the multinational cigarette manufacturing companies.

“FBR collected Rs114 billion in FED from cigarette industry in 2016 but it dropped to Rs84 billion the following year due to introduction of three tier taxation system,” Malik Imran said.

He added: “FBR forwarded the reason for the introduction of three tier system that it would reduce illicit cigarette trade which was around 40pc, but the independent reports suggest that illicit trade was only 9pc.”

He said that FBR totally relied upon the figures provided by the multinational companies, who in return benefitted from the three tier system under which tax rate was very low. The members of the groups expressed confidence that if recommendation on tobacco tax reform adopted by the government, it will help simplify Pakistan’s tobacco tax system.

It will also help reduce government’s administrative costs including enforcement and compliance and further align it with best global practices.

",2019-01-11,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital witnessed a complete shutter down strike on Thursday against the environmental issues caused by the diversion of Neelum River for commissioning Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (NJHP).

The strike call was given by an alliance of civil society activists who include lawyers, traders, political workers and students under the banner of “Darya Bachao, Muzaffarabad Bachao (Save River, Save Muzaffarabad) Committee.”

The committee has been persistently organising different events to draw attention of the authorities concerned towards serious environmental issues following reduced water discharge in Neelum river beyond Nauseri – the composite dam site of NJHP-- from where water is diverted through a tunnel system to the powerhouse in Chattar Klass.

Once roaring Neelum river now gives the looks of a small rivulet right from Nauseri to Domel, where it merges in Jhelum river.

Nauseri is located some 40km northeast of Muzaffarabad.

While the residents of Muzaffarabad are already reeling from the adverse effects of diversion of Neelum River, the proposed Kohala project, which envisages diversion of Jhelum River through a similar tunnel system, has compounded their worries.

Witnesses said that it was after a long time Muzaffarabad had witnessed such a successful strike, as all groups of traders were on the same page on this issue.

All markets, shops, medical stores and kiosks in all neighbourhoods observed the strike. Even the street vendors were not seen anywhere in the town.

“People of Muzaffarabad have woken up to the disaster wreaked by NJHP,” said Faisal Jamil Kashmiri, a lead activist of the committee.

He said NJHP was not a mega power project, but a “mega corruption project” at the cost of the lives of people of Muzaffarabad.

“If any independent and impartial commission probes this project, hundreds of people associated with the execution process will spend the rest of their lives behind the bars,” he said.

Shaukat Nawaz Mir, a top trader leader, said the movement had begun after “non implementation of agreed conditions” by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda).

He said launching power projects in AJK without entering into any agreement with the AJK government amounted toinsult of the people of this territory.

A similar strike was also held in the town of Garhi Dupatta, some 20 kilometres south of here in Jhelum valley, where demonstrators vowed to go to any lengths to stop Kohala project.

",2019-01-11,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has told the federal government that the prime minister’s initiative to set up a university at the Prime Minister House would violate the city’s master plan.

The authority has told the federal government it will have to alter the master plan if it wishes to set up a university in a government building.

Sources in the CDA said that the authority informed the government in an official letter on Wednesday that, according to the capital’s master plan, a university cannot be opened in an administrative building.

Authority suggests involving recently-notified commission revising master plan

They said the CDA told the government that a university in the Prime Minister House would be “non-compatible use” of a government building.

The CDA told the government that the commission recently notified to carry out a comprehensive revision of Islamabad’s master plan could be asked to look into the university matter as well.

The inaugural ceremony and conference for the Islamabad National University – which is to be set up in the Prime Minister House – was held last month.

The government had announced at the time that the university was envisioned as an institution designed to support research-based policymaking.

According to the government, it would initially consist of the Institute of Advanced Studies, which would be tasked with providing science-based annual reports to the government on emerging challenges facing Pakistan and the world, and a PhD programme would be started there at a later stage.

However, the CDA’s objections may set the government’s plans back by at least six months, which is the amount of time the aforementioned commission has to revise the city’s master plan.

CDA spokesperson Syed Safdar Ali confirmed that the CDA wrote to the government explaining that a university could not be opened at the Prime Minister House without changing the master plan.

He said the CDA told the government that a university would be non-compatible use of a public building.

Sources said the Ministry of Federal Education had asked the CDA through the Ministry of Interior to give its perspective on the plan to open a university in the Prime Minister House.

A source in the authority said the CDA submitted its view “in response to a letter from the education ministry”.

The government may also find it difficult to get the university’s bill passed in parliament; although the bill would pass in the National Assembly, the PTI does not have enough seats in the Senate to pass the bill without the opposition’s support.

Sources said that the government will have to get a bill passed by parliament in order to offer degree programmes, including PhD programmes, at the university, which cannot offer programmes without a charter.

Justice Ayesha A Malik in 2015 had directed the board’s chairman to hear the point of view of the petitioner and other stakeholders and consider the issue of inclusion of a chapter on the fundamental rights in the textbooks.

However, the petitioner’s counsel Sheraz Zaka told the court that despite a lapse of three and a half years the court order had not been complied with.

He submitted that the inclusion of fundamental rights chapter in the curriculum would create awareness among the youth and children about their rights, regretting that no effort had been made in this regard despite the court order issued to this effect on April 8, 2015.

He asked the court to issue a contempt notice to the board’s chairman and seek an explanation from him on the non-compliance of the order.

After hearing the arguments, Justice Malik issued a notice to the board chairman and directed him to file his reply by April 8.

FOOD WASTAGE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday issued notices to federal and the provincial governments on a petition seeking legislation against wastage of food.

Advocate Ahmad Pansota filed the petition contending that a huge quantity of food was wasted during marriage functions and other such events but there was no law in the country to check the practice.

He said the laws relating to preservation of food were available in other countries but no such law had been enacted in Pakistan.

He pointed out that neither the federal nor provincial government had initiated any step to prevent the food wastage. He said it was the constitutional obligation of the governments to provide food to every citizen and avoid its wastage.

He asked the court to direct the governments to make an effective law to check food wastage.

After hearing initial arguments, Justice Jawad Hassan issued notices to the federal and Punjab governments and sought their replies within a fortnight.

",2019-01-11,"LAHORE: The Punjab government promises a uniform curriculum at least for primary schools in the province next year.

“A uniform curriculum for primary schools in the province will be introduced by March 2020,” Schools Education Minister Murad Raas told the Punjab Assembly here on Thursday. He was responding to a written question in the House.

He said the curriculum would also include a certain portion of religious teachings and that uniform syllabus for higher levels would be introduced in due course.

Replying to a query about existence of both English and Urdu mediums in state-run schools, he chided former chief minister Shahbaz Sharif for it saying the PML-N leader introduced English medium without making available teachers for the purpose.

He said English would be taught in primary schools as a language and other subjects would be taught in Urdu.

Irritated by criticism of his leadership, PML-N lawmaker Samiullah Khan asked why the PTI could not introduce a uniform curriculum during its five-year rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Minister tells PA English will be taught as language, other subjects in Urdu

He also pointed out that Mr Raas ‘desecrated’ the chair, being held by deputy speaker Dost Mazari, by saying to it while sitting in his own seat “to [ignore the opposition members’ talk and] move forward”.

Mr Khan said the minister attempted to dictate the chair through the remark.

This tempted a treasury member to point out that PML-N’s Waris Kallu too had desecrated the chair during last Monday’s proceedings by objecting to senior MPA Mian Shafi’s presiding over the session. The Monday’s issue thus resurfaced in the ensuing debate and led Mr Mazari to give, as acting speaker, his ruling on it.

Quoting Article 67 of the Constitution, the ruling said that the House shall have power to act notwithstanding any vacancy in the membership thereof, and any proceedings in the House shall not be invalid on the ground that some persons who were not entitled to do so sat, voted or otherwise took part in the proceedings.

It said that assumption of chair at the commencement of the sitting on Jan 7, 2019, by Mian Shafi Muhammad was absolutely in accordance with the rules and was further validated by the motion adopted by the House, and the entire proceedings on Jan 7 were valid and in accordance with law.

",2019-01-11,"LAHORE: An accountability court on Thursday began proceedings to declare Kamran Kiyani, a brother of former army chief retired Gen Ashfaq Pervez Kiyani, Paragon City Housing Society’s director Nadeem Zia and another absconder in the Ashiana-i-Iqbal scheme case.

As the court resumed hearing on the reference, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) filed a report stating that warrants for the arrest of the three suspects had not been served upon them since their residences were found locked.

NAB Special Prosecutor Waris Ali Janjua asked the court to start proceedings under sections 87 & 88 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) to declare Kiyani and others absconders.

Judge Syed Najamul Hassan admitted the request and directed the NAB to start the process to declare the three suspects absconders. The judge also directed the bureau to publish the warrants in newspapers against the three suspects by Feb 11.

Explaining the absence of Leader of the Opposition in National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif, an official of the Kot Lakhpat jail told the court that Mr Sharif was supposed to appear before a medical board.

Mr Sharif’s counsel Amjad Pervez stated that there would be no harm in appearance of the opposition leader in court if the medical board permitted him.

The prosecutor said the defence counsel had been repeating same stance for the last two hearings. He also accused the counsel of employing delaying tactics.

The judge adjourned further hearing till Jan 24 and also directed the NAB to furnish readable copies of the reference filed in the case. Three suspects -- former principal secretary to prime minister Fawad Hassan Fawad, former director general of Lahore Development Authority Ahad Khan Cheema and Shahid Shafique of Bismillah Engineering -- were produced by the NAB during the hearing.

The NAB in its reference accused Shahbaz Sharif of misusing his powers as the chief minister of Punjab. It said the Punjab Land Development Company (PLDC) following due approval of its Board of Directors (BoD) awarded the contract for infrastructure development of Ashiyana-i-Iqbal to successful bidder namely M/S Ch. A. Latif & Sons in 2013.

It said a company namely CONPRO Services (Pvt) Limited, which filed a so-called complaint, had bribed then Punjab secretary implementation Fawad Hassan Fawad. The complainant company is believed to be owned by Kamran Kiyani, the NAB said.

The reference said the former chief minister without a lawful authority ordered the PLDC to entrust the housing project to the LDA when Sharif’s close aide Ahad Cheema was heading the authority as its director general. It said the LDA undertook the project under the public-private partnership to give unlawful benefit to a blue-eyed firm M/S Bismillah Engineering Services, which was proxy firm of M/S Paragon City (Pvt) Limited.

The NAB also accused Cheema of misusing his authority with criminal intent and awarding Rs14 billion contracts of the low-cost housing scheme.

",2019-01-11,"MITHI: Prime Minister’s Spe­cial Assistant on Power Shahzad Qasim on Thursday visited Thar coal power project’s block-II and received a briefing on the laying of a 143km-long railway track from the site to the nearest main railway line.

The aim of laying the new track is to facilitate transportation of coal to the lignite-fired power plants in Jamshoro and certain other areas.

The briefing was arranged by the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) at the block-II site and attended by Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmad Shaikh, the firm’s CEO Syed Abul Fazal Rizvi and chairman of Engro Energy Limited Ahsan Zafar Syed.

PM’s aide Shahzad Qasim pledges to help get necessary approvals

Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah reportedly provided his special aircraft to the PM’s aide, who took an aerial view of the project site and coal fields and Thar Foundation projects along with the energy minister.

Imtiaz Shaikh said that the Sindh government always rema­in­ed willing to work with the federal government on any energy project.

This [collaboration] would not only help further harness indigenous energy resources but would also contribute to the efforts towards making Thar the “energy capital of Pakistan”.

Speaking at the briefing, Shah­zad Qasim said that the federal government was committed to support the Thar coal project in every possible manner.

Endorsing SECMC’s proposal on the rail track, he advised the mining firm to formally submit it with the relevant federal authorities and held out the assurance that he would help initiate the process for its approval from the federal and Chinese stakeholders including the Pakistan Railways.

“I will take up the proposal [of the rail track] at federal government’s forums to get desired funding and the necessary approvals,” said Mr Qasim.

Giving his personal view, he described the proposal as “very much practicable” and said it could be executed within a short span of time.

Mr Qasim appeared impressed by the achievements of the public-private partnership between the Sindh government and SECMC and remarked that it was going to make Tharis’ dreams into a reality.

SECMC chief Syed Abul Fazal Rizvi said at the briefing that the firm was very close to producing electron from the 660MW twin power plant.

He also highlighted the vitality of the proposed rail track between the coal source and national electricity network.

Mr Qasim, along with Mr Shaikh and SECMC executives visited the mining sites, power plants and social welfare projects.

They also travelled in women-driven dumpers and visited the New Senhri Dars village, where a number of displaced Thari families are being resettled.

",2019-01-11,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Thursday informed the Sindh Assembly that the Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) had collected Rs44.36 billion in the first six months of the fiscal year 2018-19.

Answering lawmakers’ queries during Question Hour in the assembly, he said that the SRB had collected Rs38bn during the same period in 2017.

The CM, who also holds the portfolio of finance, said that Sindh was the only province which had consistently been achieving its revenue target.

He told the house that the provincial government was not running overdraft with the State Bank of Pakistan for last three years.

Replying to another question regarding the merger of Sindh Bank and Summit Bank, Mr Shah said that the provincial cabinet had decided to merge both the banks.

He said that in fact Sindh Bank was not being merged with Summit Bank; rather there was a proposal to merge the Summit Bank with Sindh Bank, which would stay as surviving entity.

“This is under process and will be materialised after approval of the provincial cabinet, Supreme Court of Pakistan and State Bank of Pakistan”, he added.

The chief minister further said that the Summit Bank was not given any undue favour in the process.

He said names of other banks were also in consideration but lastly, the cabinet decided to go with Summit Bank.

When Mr Shah said that the merger process had been halted for some reasons, MPA Nusrat Sehar Abbasi of the Grand Democratic Alliance asked him to inform the house about those reasons. The CM replied that the matter was taken up by the apex court and it was still sub judice.

Replying to another question, he said that an amount of Rs4.2bn was kept in the budget for lower-income groups through Cash Transfer Programme. “An additional Rs 2,000 would be automatically transferred to over 1.8 million families, who are listed in Benazir Income Support Programme in the month of Ramazan,” he added.

The chief minister said that a programme ‘Unconditional Cash Transfer for Poverty Alleviation’ had been designed for poverty alleviation.

",2019-01-11,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court has reserved its judgement in a case pertaining to an alleged attempt on the life of American educationist Debra Lobo made by an Islamic State-inspired convict.

Convicted accused Saad Aziz, alias Tin Tin, has been charged with shooting at and wounding Ms Lobo, the vice principal of Karachi’s Jinnah Medical and Dental College, on Shaheed-i-Millat Road in April 2015.

The ATC-XI judge, who is conducting the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, reserved his judgement after recording the evidence and final arguments from the prosecution and defence sides.

According to the prosecution, the veteran educationist was on her way home in Defence Housing Authority in a car when the attack took place at approximately 3pm.

Although she survived the attack, Ms Lobo suffered two bullet wounds on her hand and face.

Aziz, who along with other IS-inspired youths had been sentenced to death by a military court in the cases pertaining to the Safoora Goth carnage and killing of social media campaigner and human rights activist Sabeen Mahmud, was booked in the present case registered under Sections 324 (attempted murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at the Ferozabad police station.

During the trial, Advocate Mohammad Jiwani, defence counsel for Saad Aziz, contended that his client was framed in the present case and that there was no evidence available to establish his role in the offence.

The prosecutor argued that an eyewitness had identified Saad Aziz as the primary shooter in the incident, during an identification parade.

The court was asked to punish the detained accused.

After hearing final arguments from both sides, the judge reserved his verdict in the case to be pronounced later.

Aziz, a business graduate from a prestigious Karachi institution, along with his other accomplices was handed over to military authorities in January 2016 to face trial before military courts in 18 cases.

Later, the convicts were handed back to jail authorities.

",2019-01-11,"KARACHI: Some 1,750 dock workers of the Port Qasim Authority on Thursday took out a peaceful rally from Regal Chowk to the Karachi Press Club to highlight their issues with their employers for which they have been protesting for the last 108 days.

Social workers, human rights activists and trade unionists also joined in the rally to show their solidarity with the workers’ cause.

Abdul Wahid, a dock worker, said that they did loading and unloading work at all the port berths but the problem occurred at berths three and four, which are coal terminals and whose management has been taken over by a Chinese company, which was not paying them for their work. “We have not been paid for eight months now by them. When they were new, we also in good faith worked for them for free because we wanted to be nice to our Chinese brothers. Our countries have maintained very good relations over the years after all,” he said.

‘PTI leaders, when in opposition, helped us get renewed our contracts, but now they are looking the other way’

“We had thought that they were just going through teething problems and that they would pay us sooner or later. But after it became clear to us that they had no intention of paying us our wages, we demanded it,” said Fareed Khan, another dock worker. “That’s when they also started firing us.”

Mukhtar Khan, who was also protesting at the rally, explained when asked how their families were coping with the situation: “We are earning from our work at the other berths such as numbers one and two. But times are hard as that money is not enough after all to make two ends meet,” he said.

Mohammad Akbar said that there were many of them and all did not find work every day. “There are over 1,700 workers and each day they contract different men. For example on day one there will be one to hundred of us who will be taken on for the work. Then on day two 101st to 200th worker will be called to work. It is like a rotation system of work. So everyone doesn’t earn wages daily. We depend then on our monthly salaries, which we have not got since June 2018,” he said.

About their income before the crisis, Abdul Ghaffar, another labourer, said that usually a common worker or loader would get Rs23,000 and a crane operator Rs43,000 a month. “Daily wages were like a bonus income and fluctuated between Rs1,000, 1,500 and 2,000,” he said.

Hussain Badshah, the secretary general of the Workers Union of Port Qasim, told Dawn that they were surprised to learn of the intentions of the Chinese. “But if we raise our voice to point out the injustice, they tell us to go home.”

“Basically,” he said, “the Chinese need to be educated about Pakistan’s labour laws so that they take our charter of demands seriously. We have been working at the dockyard since 1981, we deserve some respect.”

Badshah also said that they had had issues in the past too like in 2016 when their two-year contract had expired and politicians, including current Governor of Sindh Imran Ismail and Federal Minister of Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi, were by their side making speeches in their favour as the Muslim League-N was in power then. “It was thanks to them that our contracts were renewed then. But now when they are in a position to do something for us and direct the Chinese to treat us right, they are looking the other way,” he said.

“The Chinese say they will bring their own labour from China for the work here. Then where are we to go?”

",2019-01-11,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court-mandated commission on water and sanitation in Sindh recommended the establishment of six garbage transfer stations on scientific lines, a master plan for water distribution in the provincial capital and sought timely completion of treatment and effluent plants.

In its final progress report, placed before the Supreme Court, the commission, headed by retired Justice Ameer Hani Muslim, made several recommendations, including proper disposal of garbage, improvement in water distribution and sanitation, revamping of environmental body and establishment of a centralised complaint cell in Karachi to address complaints about civic issues.

The commission, which was established in January last year, and is set to complete its tenure on Jan 15, in its final report said that the recommendations were based on its directives passed from time to time and the undertakings/commitments given by various departments, agencies and individuals.

Judicial commission places final progress report, making various recommendations, before Supreme Court

Solid waste

The commission suggested the establishment of six garbage transfer stations in Karachi on scientific lines and said that this scheme had been included in the annual development programme (ADP) of 2018-19 and required a follow-up and implementation by the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB).

Another scheme about development and transformation of landfill sites to meet international standards has also been made part of ADP 2018-19 and the provincial government needed to identify and set up such landfill sites for all districts in Sindh for proper disposal of solid waste.

The SSWMB has to carry out waste-to-energy projects through the ADP schemes during the current fiscal year, it added.

The report further said that the SSWMB would be activated in other divisional headquarters of Sindh during the current financial year.

Water and sanitation

The commission observed that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board must prepare a water distribution and sanitation master plan to meet the existing and future needs of the city.

The existing water supply schemes needed to be rehabilitated and the government should come up with a phased plan within three months. Improving the quality of drinking water by rehabilitating and updating the existing water filtration plants through close monitoring and the task of monitoring may be assigned to the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources after proper evaluation and fulfilment of formalities, it added.

The commission urged the provincial and federal governments to address the issues related to K-IV on a priority basis and said that water losses, which consumed about a quarter of Karachi’s total water resources, must be checked while flow meters at all important water supply stations must be in place by June 30.

It also underlined the need for timely completion of a number of water supply schemes in the provincial metropolis and recommended setting up a centralised complaint cell at the commissioner’s office to address public complaints regarding all civic issues in Karachi.

The final report further stated that the completion/rehabilitation of treatment plant-I (TP-I) and TP-III must be completed by July and December 2019, respectively, and TP-IV be completed as per schedule (at the end of 2020).

The commission also asked Defence Housing Authority to complete a 2MGD treatment plant at Seaview by April and to ensure that no untreated waste was discharged in the sea after the completion of the said TP.

The TP-V is committed to be installed by the Karachi Port Trust within two years near the Mai Kolachi Bypass and the combined effluent treatment plant at Nooriabad SITE should be completed by June 2019 while similar effluent plants at SITE in Hyderabad and Sukkur must be completed by December 2019, subject to budgetary allocations.

Environment

The commission recommended a complete overhauling of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency by strengthening its physical, technical and academic capacity. The Sepa DG has suggested the establishment of climate change, research and development and law enforcement wings, it added.

The provincial government should take steps to establish environmental laboratories, set up Sepa offices at district level and Sepa must complete the survey of all industrial areas.

244,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456727/pa-resolution-warns-centre-of-protest-against-persistent-gas-shortage-in-sindh,"PA resolution warns Centre of protest against persistent gas shortage in Sindh
",2019-01-11,"KARACHI: The Sindh legislature on Saturday passed a resolution, unanimously expressing its immense displeasure over the reduced gas supply to Sindh, warning Islamabad to end the “unconstitutional” gas loadshedding, or face a protest to be launched by everyone living in the province.

The legislature also unanimously passed The Sindh Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases Bill, 2018 with the aim to widen the facilities to cure heart diseases across the province.

A joint resolution was moved by Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Mohammad Hussain, Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani and Grand Democratic Alliance’s Nand Kumar, expressing concern over the prolonged gas shortages across Sindh that had gravely impacted the province’s economy, industries and homes.

Lawmakers want an urgent meeting of the Council of Common Interests convened to help resolve issues

The resolution reads: “This house resolves and recommends to the Government of Sindh to approach [the] federal government to take notice of violation of Article 158 of the Constitution by the Federal Ministry. Due to the shortage of gas the domestic as well as commercial consumers are facing a lot of difficulties in the province of Sindh.”

It further stated that the department concerned “shall within a period of one month from the date of communication of the resolution by the assembly secretariat”, apprise the assembly of the action taken on the resolution as required under the Rules of Procedure of the Sindh Assembly.

CCI meeting

The speakers demanded that a meeting of the Council of Common Interest (CCI) urgently be called to address the issue and provide relief to the people of Sindh.

The resolution expressed deep concern over the incessant gas outages across the province, which is the largest contributor to nationwide gas production.

Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the issue of adequate gas supply to Sindh had been raised in the meetings of the CCI previously and his government was in touch with Islamabad to make sure that the people of Sindh should not suffer because of such outages.

He referred to a previous meeting of the CCI, in March last year during the previous federal government, in which the attorney general had been appointed to recommend a comprehensive policy on the gas supply issue as raised by his government.

He said the Sindh government had sent its comments to the AG in a timely manner while none of the other provincial governments did that at which they had been asked to send their comments within a month or they would be deemed in agreement with the policy.

Mr Shah said the then chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had supported Sindh’s stance. He said apart from him with KP CM’s support, there were three other members who belonged to Sindh and could back his government’s stand. He hoped Balochistan would also be there to support Sindh.

He appreciated the opposition for moving the resolution and backing him. He said he would use that support to ask Islamabad to convene an urgent meeting of the CCI to discuss the issue.

He said he hoped the federal government would give its due right to Sindh, adding that he had met the federal ministers for petroleum and power and other top officials from Islamabad who had accepted his argument on the matter.

He said he hoped that the federal government would give its nod for the wind corridor project.

Sindh opposition’s top priority

Opposition leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi said that despite representing the PTI, which ruled Islamabad, Sindh was their top priority.

He said gas wells were getting depleted, warranting new explorations.

PTI’s parliamentary leader Haleem Adil Shaikh said his party had supported the resolution as it would not leave the people of Sindh in the lurch.

Minister Ghani referred to the Constitution saying it clearly accepted the first right for the use of gas by the province where it was produced.

MQM-P’s Khwaja Izharul Hasan said the gas issue had persisted for a few years as it had forced the K-Electric to shut down its gas-powered plants. He asked the chief minister if Sindh was getting its gas royalty share.

GDA’s Nand Kumar said no gas was being provided to the areas where gas was being produced.

Ghulam Qadir Chandio, Heer Soho and Abdul Rasheed also spoke.

Sindh Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases

Earlier, the select committee presented its report on The Sindh Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases Bill, 2018, saying it had approved it after making minor corrections and amendments under different clauses and found it fit to be passed by the assembly.

Later, Health Minister Azra Pechuho presented the bill clause by clause and the house passed it unanimously.

Its statement of objects and reasons said: “At present there is only one cardiovascular hospital in Sindh namely National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases located in Karachi which does not cover all the patients coming from the entire province of Sindh due to heavy load of patients.”

It further said that to facilitate poor cardiac patients of the province by providing quality care and to enhance the teaching skills of undergraduates and postgraduates and to make them at par with the international counterparts, “it is expedient to establish an institute known as the Sindh Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases and to enact a law in the matter”.

The bill further said that the headquarters of the institute would be at Karachi/Sukkur.

Alternative dispute resolution

Besides, the house also unanimously passed The Code of Civil Procedure (Sindh Amendment) Bill, 2018, which introduces alternative dispute resolution (ADR) to shed burden on the courts and provide quicker justice in civil cases to save the litigants from spending high costs and time.

The bill said the ADR offered mechanisms such as mediation and conciliation, which were internationally recognised as a vital part of the justice system.

The house discussed calling-attention notices by Heer Soho, Tanzila Sheedi, Marvi Rashdi, and Ghanwer Isran on various issues.

",2019-01-11,"WASHINGTON: Facebook users aged 65 plus and conservatives are more likely to share fake news on the platform than younger or more liberal counterparts, according to a new study.

Researchers from Princeton University and New York University analysed the Facebook posts of nearly 1,200 people who agreed to share their data in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. They then compared links the respondents had shared on Facebook with several lists — including one compiled by BuzzFeed — of websites known to share false information.

The study, published in Science Advances, found less than only 8.5 per cent of respondents shared a link from one of these websites. However, those that did tended to be older and self-identified as being on the conservative end of the political spectrum. In fact, users over 65 — regardless of political affiliations — shared “nearly seven times as many articles from fake news domains” as 18 to 29-year-olds, the youngest age group studied.

“No other demographic characteristic seems to have a consistent effect on sharing fake news,” the authors reported. “It is possible that an entire cohort of Americans, now in their 60s and beyond, lacks the level of digital media literacy necessary to reliably determine the trustworthiness of news encountered online,” they suggested.

The authors also suggested the impact of aging on memory could have an effect. “Under this account, memory deteriorates with age in a way that particularly undermines resistance to ‘illusions of truth’,” they wrote.

",2019-01-11,"HAVING already lost the Test series against South Africa, Pakistan will find it hard to motivate themselves to regroup and bounce back to end the three-match rubber 2-1 after the disappointments they encountered in the opening two Tests.

The Wanderers, the venue of the third Test starting today, is not a place where I would expect Pakistan to look impressive for the mere fact that this has never been a venue where they have done well.

Pakistan’s first Test encounter here was in 1994-95 in which they were soundly beaten and since then their batting has badly let them down each time they have played here. And now when they are panic-stricken with their obvious fear against the South African pace battery, I do not see Pakistan batting blooming beyond our expectations.

Having said that, I would like Azhar Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Babar Azam, Asad Shafiq and the rest to stand up and build a sizeable total for their team here and take the fight to the hosts. The chances of them doing so, however, appear quite slim.

Pakistan must put up a fight at Wanderers to save series blushes

Also, we must not forget that last year the Wanderers pitch was so poor against the touring Indians that it was reported and the venue ended with demerit points from the ICC.

Surely, Pakistan would be aware of that if only they have had a look at the previous matches played here.

It is important, therefore, for them to continue with leg-spinner Yasir Shah despite his disappointments with the pitches not helping him.

The failures of our batsmen does not encourage me to recommend the same pair of opening batsmen. Imam has got to go and should Fakhar Zaman to bring in fresh players like Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Rizwan.

For South Africa, their captain Faf du Plessis is not playing because he has been suspended for one Test for his team’s slow over rate during last week’s second Test at Cape Town.

His replacement as captain Dean Elgar may turn out to be even more aggressive in his approach than the phlegmatic du Plessis has been and he may not allow Sarfraz Ahmed and his men to breathe easy or show any improvement from their horrible efforts in the series thus far.

For their lack of efforts and skills, Pakistan are consigned for another nightmare which they are so desperate to avoid after being rolled out in each of the previous Tests inside three and four days respectively.

What really is most important for Pakistan also is that immediately after this final Test they will be padding up once again to play in the ODIs and Twenty20 series.

Any improvement in this Test would realistically provide them with certain amount of confidence which at this stage which is in very short supply for the entire squad at the moment, and that includes the entire support staff.

Whatever the circumstances in which Pakistan take up the opposition here will obviously count a lot to lift up their sagging morale for the one-day fixtures ahead in which Pakistan should look a different team altogether.

247,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456867/govt-claims-success-against-trade-deficit-as-december-data-shows-steep-fall,"Govt claims success against trade deficit as December data shows steep fall
",2019-01-11,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade deficit fell sharply by 15 per cent in the month of December 2018 compared to November, driven largely by decline in fuel imports and machinery.

When compared to December 2017, the decline is even sharper, falling by 18.6pc, according to the official figures of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics shared with the federal cabinet on Thursday.

Meanwhile, exports showed sluggish growth of 5.48pc compared to December 2017 despite a massive devaluation of almost 33pc since then. Exports touched $2.08 billion in December 2018 compared to $1.97bn last year.

Exports show sluggish growth, ministry claims regulatory duties have compressed imports

The half yearly exports posted a paltry growth of 2.19pc to $11.21bn from $10.97bn over the corresponding months of last year. The numbers show the government still has more ground to cover in order to fulfill its pledge to revive exports.

Trade deficit has been at the heart of the economy’s difficulties in the external sector, hitting an all-time high of $37.6bn last year, and respite on this front has been long-awaited. The government wasted no time to tout the figures.

Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry in a media briefing held immediately after the cabinet meeting said that the prime minister drew confidence from the decline in the trade deficit.

The premier told the cabinet when presented with the figures that “we are moving in the right direction,” Fawad remarked.

Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Khusro Bakhtiar said that his government is coming up with a five-year economic plan focusing on increasing exports from the country. He said the proposed policy will be focused on producing growth in the country.

In a late night press release, the finance ministry also touted the figures. The statement, which was a departure from standard practice, said that the “[g]overnment’s policy measures have resulted in shrinking of trade deficit, decline in imports and increase in exports which augurs well for overall balance of payment of the country.”

“The trade deficit that stood at $17.7bn in July-December 2017 has shrunk by 5pc to $16.8bn in the corresponding period in 2018”, the release highlighted.

In absolute terms, trade deficit dipped to $2.36bn in December 2018 from $2.78bn in November 2018. On the same pattern, it fell from $2.9bn in December 2017.

The value of imported goods in the period of July to December was recorded at $28.03bn, down 2.29pc or $658 million from the import bill in the corresponding months of last fiscal year, which was $28.69bn. The decline in imports was steeper in December 2018 which fell by 8.8pc to $4.44bn from $4.8bn over the corresponding month in 2017.

“This trend is even more pronounced in respect of imports under regulatory duty (RD) regime, where the import value has declined from $5.2bn in July-December 2017 to $4.4bn in July-December 2018, showing a contraction of 16pc (effective on 1994 tariff lines),” the statement from finance ministry claimed, adding that on a month to month comparison, the data “reflects an import compression of over 12pc.”

According to the press release, imports under the RD regime fell by 23pc during December 2018 when compared with December 2017.

“Data indicates that the import compression measures taken in the supplementary Finance Act, 2018 have firmly taken hold and are now effectively curtailing imports as per policy regime of the government,” the statement said.

",2019-01-11,"ISLAMABAD: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has explained that it had advised all banks to provide information about bank accounts of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).

Clarifying a news item headlined “PTI operating 18 undeclared bank accounts: SBP report” published in Dawn, the State Bank’s chief spokesman said on Thursday that the ECP had in July last year approached the SBP for assistance in obtaining information about PTI’s bank accounts from 2009 to 2013 as per the commission’s mandate enshrined in the Con­stitution and the Elections Act, 2017.

“SBP while discharging of its duties advised all banks to provide the required information/data directly to ECP by due date, as per procedure laid down under the law,” the clarification said, denying issuance of any report relating to the PTI’s bank accounts to the ECP.

“SBP neither maintains the database of banks’ individual accountholders nor possesses any related information/record thereof. Banks being the custodian of customers’ information may directly provide this information to various agencies, on case-to-case basis, as per procedure laid down under the respective laws. Therefore, it is out of question that SBP has reported 18 undeclared bank accounts of PTI out of total 26 to the ECP,” it added.

Informed sources confirmed that the data, which revealed that the PTI was operating 18 undeclared bank accounts, had directly been provided by the scheduled banks to the ECP on the advice of the State Bank.

The letter to the State Bank governor on July 3, 2018. — Dawn

According to documents available with Dawn, the ECP director general (law), who heads the commission’s scrutiny committee mandated to examine the allegations of receipt of funding by the PTI from prohibited sources, had written a letter to the State Bank governor on July 3, 2018, seeking assistance from the SBP in obtaining information rela­ted to PTI’s bank accounts.

The information sought included list of bank accounts maintained by the PTI anywhere in Pakistan from 2009 to 2013, with data-wise details of transactions, country-wise list of all funds transferred to the PTI accounts from abroad during the period separately for each financial year, including particulars of remitters, and monthly bank statements of all the accounts for each financial year (2009-2013).

Subsequently, the State Bank had on July 12, 2018 written letters to the presidents/chief executives of all banks with copy of the letter. “….You are advised to provide the requisite information directly to the Election Commission of Pakistan before July, 16, 2018 positively under intimation to the State Bank of Pakistan. In case of non-existence of PTI account with your bank, a NIL position may kindly be reported to the Commission,” the SBP letter read.

Credible sources insist that the data showed the PTI was operating 26 bank accounts across the country, but only eight of them had been declared before the ECP.

Former ECP secretary Kanwar Dishad, while talking to Dawn, said it was irrelevant if the SBP had provided information about PTI’s bank accounts directly to the ECP or the data had been generated from the banks on its directives. He said the ECP enjoyed the powers to take back the symbol of any political party found to have been involved in concealing its funding and bank account details.

",2019-01-11,"KARACHI / LAHORE: Just a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered the removal of heads of the Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) and the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) over the gas crisis that gripped Punjab and Sindh last month, new managing directors of the companies were appointed on Thursday.

“SSGC’s board of directors has appointed Imran Farookhi, DMD (corporate affairs), as the acting managing director till a new incumbent is appointed,” said a statement issued by the company. “Mr Farookhi has been assigned the charge of acting MD in addition to his own existing portfolio of DMD (corporate affairs).”

“The new acting MD has a rich professional experience of over 31 years,” said the statement citing professional profile of Mr Farookhi. “A mechanical engineer by profession, Mr Farookhi obtained a degree in mechanical engineering from the NED University of Engineering and Technology in 1986. Mr Farookhi joined the SSGC as acting DMD in June 2016.”

Similarly, the government appointed Amir Tufail as SNGPL managing director after accepting resignation of outgoing MD Amjad Latif.

Outgoing MDs of SSGCL, SNGPL were removed by PM over gas crisis

Mr Tufail, the SNGPL’s deputy managing director (services), took over the charge of the office of MD for a probationary period of 90 days.

“Amir Tufail is the senior-most executive of the company working since 2004. He is a chartered accountant with more than 27 years of working experience in and outside the country. After 90 days, the government will regularise him as SNGPL MD,” said an official source.

The outgoing MDs of the SSGCL and the SNGPL were removed by the prime minister in view of a report of an inquiry committee. The committee had been constituted by the prime minister to fix responsibility for problems faced by the consumers due to gas shortage in recent days. The committee had submitted its report to the PM on Tuesday.

The petroleum ministry’s senior officials reportedly bade farewell to outgoing SNGPL managing director Amjad Latif. They expressed sympathy with him over the abrupt decision of the prime minister though the gas import and allocation policies rested with the federal government.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, they accused the bureaucracy of failing to resolve problems of the people in the last four years.

Quetta Mayor Dr Kaleemullah Khan Kakar, Khuzdar Mayor Mir Abdul Rahim Kurd, Chairman of Pishin’s District Council Essa Roshan, Chairman for Kila Abdullah Malik Usman Achakzai and chairmen of other districts and municipal corporations said that after they had taken the oath of office the authorities concerned denied them their powers and were also creating hurdles in smooth running of their affairs.

They said that they took up the issue of powers of local bodies at every forum but failed to get their due rights.

“We also demanded making local bodies a partner of provincial government by giving 40 per cent development funds to the institutions,” Dr Kaleemullah Kakar said, adding the government and bureaucracy, instead of releasing funds, were spending the same themselves.

Mayors and chairmen of district and municipal committees demanded that the term of local bodies, which was ending on Jan 28, should be extended till March 28.

They expressed the hope that Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani would accept their demands and help in empowering local bodies institutions, besides getting their funds released.

They said that the government had slashed funds of local bodies in the current financial year.

",2019-01-11,"ISLAMABAD: A senior leader of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Jahangir Khan Tareen, has filed in the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) an application seeking acquittal in a case relating to an attack on the Parliament House and Pakistan Television building during the 2014 sit-in.

ATC judge Syed Kausar Abbasi Zaidi, after a preliminary hearing of Mr Ta­reen’s plea, issued a notice to the prosecutor and adjourned the matter to Feb 12. The court had granted exemption to Finance Minister Asad Umar, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Defence Minister Pervez Khattak, Education and Professional Training Minister Shafqat Mehmood, Ijaz Chaudhry and other PTI leaders from personal attendance for Thursday’s proceedings.

The court, however, adjourned proceedings on a plea seeking acquittal of President Dr Arif Alvi in the same case. Mr Alvi has also been nominated as a suspect allegedly inciting violence during the sit-in by the PTI.

Though Mr Alvi being president of the country enjoys constitutional immunity in criminal proceedings, he had in September filed a petition seeking acquittal in the case.

Judge issues notice to prosecutor for Feb 12

According to Article 248 (2) of the Constitution, “No criminal proceeding whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the President or a Governor in any court during term of office.”

Police invoked relevant sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act against PTI chief Imran Khan and its leaders Dr Alvi, Mr Umar, Mr Qureshi, Mr Mehmood and Raja Khurram Nawaz for inciting violence during the 2014 sit-in at D-Chowk in Islamabad.

According to the prosecution, three people were killed and 26 others injured, while 60 were arrested during the violence. The prosecution submitted 65 photos, sticks, cutters, etc, to the court to establish its case.

Anchorperson’s indictment deferred Separately, the special judge, central, deferred the indictment of Dr Shahid Masood, anchorperson and former chairman of PTV.

The court was scheduled to charge-sheet Mr Masood in the PTV corruption case. However, the suspect challenged certain sections of the law invoked against him.

The judge reserved the ruling.

According to the investigation, Mr Masood being managing director and chairman of PTV was involved in embezzlement of Rs37 million in acquiring PCB media rights in 2008 when an agreement was signed with a fake company namely M/s ISS. The investigators claimed that money had also been released, thus causing a loss of millions of dollars to PTV as the state-run television failed to acquire PCB media rights from 2008 to 2013.

",2019-01-11,"ISLAMABAD: With the confirmation of another case, the total count of polio cases in the country reached nine in 2018.

The confirmation of the ninth case came two days after the departure of World Health Organisation (WHO) Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who was on a visit from Jan 6 to 8.

Mr Ghebreyesus had said that the missing children and refusal by parents were major challenges to the eradication of poliovirus from the country.

“Pakistan also needs to stop transmission of the virus from Afghanistan. Our New Year’s wish is ‘zero’ polio by end of 2019. The children of Pakistan and the children of the world deserve nothing less. Failure to eradicate polio would result in global resurgence of the disease, with as many as 200,000 new cases every year, all over the world,” he had said while addressing a press conference at the WHO head office, hours before heading home.

The last case was reported from Bana Manji Wala village near Lakki Marwat, where a 16-month-old girl (Anam, daughter of Afzal Khan) was brought with initial symptoms of paralysis. Her specimen was collected on Dec 20, 2018. Incubation of sample took 20 days to confirm. The paralysis was assumed due to poliovirus or some other reason.

An official of polio programme, requesting not to be named, said that according to the mother, the child developed respiratory tract infection with high fever and cough on Dec 6, 2018.

“The family took the girl to a medical facility and within few days her condition improved and she started playing as children do. She remained on oral medicines for respiratory infection and showed no signs of weakness in any part of the body till Dec 16, when mother noticed the child was not walking properly and had developed weakness in left lower limb,” he said.

“According to the mother, the child had received over seven Oral Polio Vaccines. The family had returned from Quetta in November after staying seven months with her spouse. The child received OPV doses at Quetta and Lakki Marwat and they never ever refused OPV,” the official said.

“Blood samples for serological assessment of immunity status have been taken from the patient and three other children from the same family,” he added.

Official said that at times, despite being vaccinated, the child got infected with poliovirus.

The official website of the polio programme shows that in 2018 as many as three cases each were reported from tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Two cases were reported from KP and one from Sindh. No polio case was reported from Punjab, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir in 2018.

",2019-01-11,"ISLAMABAD: The federal and Sindh governments on Thursday disagreed on shared financing of the Rs46.5 billion Nai Gaj dam but formed a committee to further scale down its estimated cost.

A meeting of the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) constituted a committee comprising senior representatives of the government of Sindh and the federal ministries of planning and water resources to further rationalise the cost of the Nai Gaj dam and submit a report within three days. Federal Minister for Planning Khusro Bakhtyar presided over the meeting.

The forum had returned the dam project to the relevant agencies with the instructions to address technical issues, rationalise estimated cost and ensure a road map for its financing and get back for clearance within a week.

CDWP refers the Rs17.5bn Punjab police project to Ecnec for approval

Officials said the project cost was reduced from Rs47.73bn to Rs46.5bn but the CDWP was not satisfied with it. A representative of the Sindh government told the meeting that his province was already facing reduced fiscal flows from the centre than budgeted and would not take additional burden.

The meeting noted that the estimated cost was still on the higher side and required further rationalisation. The committee should come back with another cost revision and the matter of its financing would be taken up at an appropriate level.

The federal government has taken the stance that since the Nai Gaj Dam would overcome water shortages and irrigate an area of 28,000 acres in Sindh, its financing should be jointly met by the provincial and the federal governments. Because of fiscal constraints, the federal government alone could not bear the entire cost of a project of purely provincial nature.

An official statement said the meeting formally referred the $986 million Emergency Plan for Polio Eradication to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for approval after removal of certain observations.

The meeting also recommended for Ecnec approval the Rs17.520bn Punjab police integrated command, control and communication project.

Officials said the CDWP meeting on January 3 had agreed in principle to refer the polio eradication project to Ecnec with certain conditions, including an identifiable and traceable execution plan and the update on the achievements of the project so far. The relevant agencies had submitted a report that led to clearance of the project.

The official statement quoted the planning minister as saying that polio eradication was a national priority so a fast monitoring mechanism should be made to ensure its smooth implementation. He instructed the federal and the provincial governments to work closely to eradicate the core reservoirs where sewerage water was contaminated with poliovirus.

",2019-01-11,"LAHORE: Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who is serving a seven-year sentence in the Al Azizia Steel Mills case, has complained about 'poor' facilities in the jail.

He said there was no TV set in his cell and the heater was malfunctioning. Only one newspaper was being given to him.

“However, I am in good health,” Mr Sharif was quo­ted as having said by a PML-N leader who met him in Kot Lakhpat jail on Thursday.

A couple of days ago Mr Sharif had complained abo­ut flu and fever, requesting a meeting with his physician.

Mr Sharif’s mother, dau­g­h­ter Maryam, nephew Ha­m­za Shahbaz and PML-N leaders Mushahidullah Khan, Khwaja Asif, Marri­yum Aur­an­gzeb and Rana Sanaullah were among the visitors.

Nawaz Sharif denied that he had sought an NRO-like (National Reconciliation Ordinance) pardon from anyone.

“Those claiming that I have sought NRO should better shed light on it,” Mr Sharif was quoted as having said.

The ousted premier expressed surprise over reports that he was looking for an `NRO’.

Prime Minister Imran Khan and some members of his cabinet have said more than once that opposition leaders, especially the Sharif family, were trying to secure `NRO’. The opposition has rebutted the claim.

A large number of PML-N workers gathered outside the Kot Lakhpat jail and chanted slogans in favour of their leadership. A couple of them were in chains to express solidarity with Nawaz Sharif.

Maryam Nawaz had brought lunch for her father.

Talking to reporters outside the jail, Senator Mushahidullah said Nawaz Sharif was the biggest stakeholder in the country’s politics. He said Mr Sharif was being punished for not bowing down. “Some elements are happy to see Mr Sharif in jail.”

He alleged that Shaukat Khanum Hospital’s money had been transferred to the accounts of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s sisters in Dubai. “The prime minister will have to account for this.”

Rana Sanaullah expressed the hope that Mr Sharif would get relief from the high court as the prosecution had been unable to bring forth any evidence of corruption against him. “Nawaz Sharif is facing politics of revenge,” he claimed.

He said those who had “installed the PTI government through rigged polls” should now admit their mistake and take corrective measures. “If the present economic conditions persist for another three months, businesses will be forced to pack up,” he warned.

255,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456856/cabinet-decides-to-continue-travel-ban-on-ppp-leaders,"Cabinet decides to continue travel ban on PPP leaders
",2019-01-11,"ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to continue the travel ban on Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) stalwarts, including Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Faryal Talpur and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.

The decision was made at a federal cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan at his office on Thursday.

The cabinet in its meeting on Dec 27, 2018 had decided to place names of 172 suspects of the fake bank accounts and money laundering case, including top PPP leaders and Bahria Town owner Malik Riaz, on the Exit Control List (ECL). However, the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the case, had expressed surprise on Dec 31 over placing of the names of Mr Bhutto-Zardari and Mr Shah on the ECL and ordered the government to review the decision.

Party urges Supreme Court to take notice of ‘dictatorial move’

The cabinet in its last meeting had referred the matter to a special committee of the interior ministry to review it. On Thursday, the committee presented its report to the cabinet recommending removal of 20 names from the ECL, including those of the PPP leaders.

However, Prime Minister Khan and his team rejected the recommendations and decided that the names of the top leaders of the PPP would remain on the ECL.

“The federal cabinet has decided not to remove names of Mr Bhutto-Zardari and Mr Shah from the ECL,” said Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry at a press conference held to brief the media on the decisions made by the cabinet.

He said names of the PPP leaders would remain on the ECL until a detailed written order of the Supreme Court was received. “After going through the order, we will decide whether the names of the PPP leaders should be removed from the list or the government should file a review petition against the apex court’s decision,” he added.

The minister said another committee — comprising Law Minister Farogh Naseem, the PM’s Special Assistant on Accountability Shahzad Akbar, Minister of State for Interior Shehryar Afridi and Interior Secretary Azam Suleman Khan — had been constituted to review the travel ban on the 172 suspects. The committee will present its report to the cabinet in its next meeting.

The names of the 172 suspects were placed on the ECL on the recommendations of a Joint Investigation Team formed by the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the PPP has reacted to the cabinet’s latest decision and termed it a “dictatorial decision”.

“The cabinet decision has not only exposed the ‘ugly’ face of Imran Khan but the fact that dictatorship is prevailing in the country which does not even accept the decisions of the Supreme Court,” said PPP leader Dr Nafisa Shah in a statement.

She claimed that the JIT report was prepared by the PM’s Assistant Shahzad Akbar who misused his authority and the PM’s office. “It seems that Imran Khan is scared of Bilawal Bhutto’s politics and employing negative tactics,” she added.

The PPP leader called on the apex court to take stern notice of the government’s “rigidness” and alleged that the “puppet” government was “using accountability and the ECL as tools for arm-twisting of political opponents”.

Giving details of other decisions taken by the cabinet, the information minister said the cabinet expressed satisfaction over the government’s economic policies which, according to him, had started bearing fruit.

He said the prime minister ordered the law ministry to compile a negative category list in 48 hours as per directive of the apex court of the government jobs which could not be given to Pakistani nationals having dual nationality.

Gas shortage

The cabinet also discussed prevailing gas shortage in the country as a result of which the people are facing problems in the chilly weather.

Mr Chaudhry said one of the biggest gas supply distribution systems in the world, which was in Pakistan, had started giving losses to the government because only 28 per cent of the people were receiving gas through it while others were turning on their stoves through other sources, including liquefied natural gas. “Majority of the people are deprived of gas but the mammoth system is giving us losses.”

He said the prime minister directed the petroleum ministry to formulate a comprehensive policy on the use of gas.

The minister said former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had left a burden of Rs157 billion circular debt to be paid by the gas sector, adding that there was no debt on the sector when Mr Abbasi had assumed charge as petroleum minister during the term of the last Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government.

Talking about Rs1.5 million one-month electricity bill of Prime Minister House, the minister said Imran Khan was astonished why the PM House had received such a heavy bill despite the fact that he had cut down its expenditures and use by not living in it.

“During former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s tenure 85,000 electricity units were consumed by the PM House and now half of it is consumed. Even then the present consumption is quite higher than the PM’s expectations,” he added.

Mr Chaudhry said the prime minister ordered an audit of the staff responsible for managing the PM House.

According to him, the cabinet decided to appoint senior officials as heads of different government departments on temporary basis.

Aviation Secretary retired Squadron Leader Shahrukh Nusrat has been made acting managing director of the Civil Aviation Authority and retired air marshal Arshad Malik acting chief executive officer of the Pakistan International Airlines. Muhammad Saleh Farooqui has been given additional charge of managing director of the Karachi Infrastructure Development Company.

Anjum Asad has been appointed member of the National Tariff Commission and Ayesha Aziz managing director of the Pak-Brunei Investment Company.

259,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456684/cabinet-to-wait-for-sc-written-order-regarding-removal-of-names-from-ecl-fawad-chaudhry,"Cabinet to wait for SC written order regarding removal of names from ECL: Fawad Chaudhry
",2019-01-10,"Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Thursday said the federal cabinet has rejected the recommendations of the interior ministry to remove the names of 20 individuals from the Exit Control List (ECL).

He was addressing a press conference following a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad.

The information minister said that the law ministry had informed the cabinet that the Supreme Court's written order pertaining to the removal of names from the ECL has not been issued as yet.

Chaudhry said a cabinet committee has been formed, which includes Minister for Law and Justice Barrister Dr Farogh Naseem, Minister of State for Interior Shahryar Afridi, Prime Minister's Special Assistant on Accountability Shahzad Akbar and the Interior Secretary Azam Suleman Khan. This committee will review the issues pertaining to the 172 names, looking at the roles of each person, following which it will present its recommendations to the cabinet.

The minister added that once the written orders of the SC are issued, the cabinet will also seek the committee's guidance regarding whether a review appeal of the court order should be submitted or not.

A visibly disturbed Supreme Court on December 31 had ordered the federal cabinet to reconsider its “hasty decision” of placing the names of 172 individuals, including Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and other Pakistan Peoples Party stalwarts, on the ECL.

The court had taken up the report of a joint investigation team (JIT) constituted to probe fake bank accounts revolving around a 2015 inquiry into the suspicious transactions when ‘benami’ accounts were identified.

On the recommendations of the JIT, the federal cabinet had in its meeting on Dec 27 last year decided to place the names of 172 individuals on the ECL, including Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Faryal Talpur, Murad Ali Shah, Farooq H. Naek and several other leaders and provincial ministers belonging to the PPP.

But the apex court had asked the federal cabinet to reconsider the decision in its next meeting and decide the matter after due application of mind instead of merely relying on the JIT recommendations.

“The JIT report is not a holy scripture,” the chief justice had obser­ved, adding that a sitting chief minister was being stigmatised.

'Decrease in import deficit'

According to the information minister, the government's economic policy was bearing fruit as the import deficit had decreased by $540 million in just one month.

""The prime minister has also ordered the law ministry to compile a 'negative category list' in the next 48 hours as per directions of the apex court,"" he said, adding that the list will include the jobs which could not be bestowed to Pakistani nationals having dual nationalities.

He said that during the cabinet meeting, the premier directed the petroleum ministry to formulate a comprehensive policy on the usage of gas. ""A large part of the population is still deprived of gas.""

He alleged that former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi left a burden of Rs157bn as loans to be paid by the gas sector. He further said that there was no loan when Abbasi had joined the ministry during the tenure of the last government.

The sector is also facing gas theft, he added.

Clarifying the government's position on a news item regarding a bill of the Prime Minister House, he said that the prime minister ordered an audit of the staff who were managing the PM House.

He said that acting heads of Pakistan International Airlines, Civil Aviation Agency and other institutions have been appointed, whereas permanent heads of the organisations will be appointed through due process in the near future.

The minister said that the premier has ordered the appointment of a Capital Development Authority chairman from the private sector. ""A professional from private sector should head the CDA,"" he said, adding that currently the chief secretary was assuming the charge of CDA chairman.",dawn,"['information', 'minister', 'fawad', 'chaudhry', 'thursday', 'said', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'rejected', 'recommendations', 'interior', 'ministry', 'remove', 'names', '20', 'individuals', 'exit', 'control', 'list', 'ecl', 'addressing', 'press', 'conference', 'following', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'islamabad', 'information', 'minister', 'said', 'law', 'ministry', 'informed', 'cabinet', 'supreme', 'court', 'written', 'order', 'pertaining', 'removal', 'names', 'ecl', 'issued', 'yet', 'chaudhry', 'said', 'cabinet', 'committee', 'formed', 'includes', 'minister', 'law', 'justice', 'barrister', 'dr', 'farogh', 'naseem', 'minister', 'state', 'interior', 'shahryar', 'afridi', 'prime', 'minister', 'special', 'assistant', 'accountability', 'shahzad', 'akbar', 'interior', 'secretary', 'azam', 'suleman', 'khan', 'committee', 'review', 'issues', 'pertaining', '172', 'names', 'looking', 'roles', 'person', 'following', 'present', 'recommendations', 'cabinet', 'minister', 'added', 'written', 'orders', 'sc', 'issued', 'cabinet', 'also', 'seek', 'committee', 'guidance', 'regarding', 'whether', 'review', 'appeal', 'court', 'order', 'submitted', 'visibly', 'disturbed', 'supreme', 'court', 'december', '31', 'ordered', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'reconsider', 'hasty', 'decision', 'placing', 'names', '172', 'individuals', 'including', 'sindh', 'chief', 'minister', 'syed', 'murad', 'ali', 'shah', 'pakistan', 'peoples', 'party', 'stalwarts', 'ecl', 'court', 'taken', 'report', 'joint', 'investigation', 'team', 'jit', 'constituted', 'probe', 'fake', 'bank', 'accounts', 'revolving', 'around', '2015', 'inquiry', 'suspicious', 'transactions', 'benami', 'accounts', 'identified', 'recommendations', 'jit', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'dec', '27', 'last', 'year', 'decided', 'place', 'names', '172', 'individuals', 'ecl', 'including', 'asif', 'ali', 'zardari', 'bilawal', 'bhuttozardari', 'faryal', 'talpur', 'murad', 'ali', 'shah', 'farooq', 'h', 'naek', 'several', 'leaders', 'provincial', 'ministers', 'belonging', 'ppp', 'apex', 'court', 'asked', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'reconsider', 'decision', 'next', 'meeting', 'decide', 'matter', 'due', 'application', 'mind', 'instead', 'merely', 'relying', 'jit', 'recommendations', 'jit', 'report', 'holy', 'scripture', 'chief', 'justice', 'observed', 'adding', 'sitting', 'chief', 'minister', 'stigmatised', 'decrease', 'import', 'deficit', 'according', 'information', 'minister', 'government', 'economic', 'policy', 'bearing', 'fruit', 'import', 'deficit', 'decreased', '540', 'million', 'one', 'month', 'prime', 'minister', 'also', 'ordered', 'law', 'ministry', 'compile', 'negative', 'category', 'list', 'next', '48', 'hours', 'per', 'directions', 'apex', 'court', 'said', 'adding', 'list', 'include', 'jobs', 'could', 'bestowed', 'pakistani', 'nationals', 'dual', 'nationalities', 'said', 'cabinet', 'meeting', 'premier', 'directed', 'petroleum', 'ministry', 'formulate', 'comprehensive', 'policy', 'usage', 'gas', 'large', 'part', 'population', 'still', 'deprived', 'gas', 'alleged', 'former', 'prime', 'minister', 'shahid', 'khaqan', 'abbasi', 'left', 'burden', 'rs157bn', 'loans', 'paid', 'gas', 'sector', 'said', 'loan', 'abbasi', 'joined', 'ministry', 'tenure', 'last', 'government', 'sector', 'also', 'facing', 'gas', 'theft', 'added', 'clarifying', 'government', 'position', 'news', 'item', 'regarding', 'bill', 'prime', 'minister', 'house', 'said', 'prime', 'minister', 'ordered', 'audit', 'staff', 'managing', 'pm', 'house', 'said', 'acting', 'heads', 'pakistan', 'international', 'airlines', 'civil', 'aviation', 'agency', 'institutions', 'appointed', 'whereas', 'permanent', 'heads', 'organisations', 'appointed', 'due', 'process', 'near', 'future', 'minister', 'said', 'premier', 'ordered', 'appointment', 'capital', 'development', 'authority', 'chairman', 'private', 'sector', 'professional', 'private', 'sector', 'head', 'cda', 'said', 'adding', 'currently', 'chief', 'secretary', 'assuming', 'charge', 'cda', 'chairman']","['cabinet', 'wait', 'sc', 'written', 'order', 'regarding', 'removal', 'names', 'ecl', 'fawad', 'chaudhry']"
260,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456675/asghar-khans-heirs-oppose-fias-suggestion-to-close-2012-case,"Asghar Khan's heirs oppose FIA's suggestion to close 2012 case
",2019-01-10,"Late Asghar Khan's legal heirs on Thursday submitted their joint reply to a notice in connection with the implementation of the landmark 2012 verdict in the Asghar Khan case, asking that an inquiry in accordance with the Supreme Court's six-year-old order be continued.

The apex court had issued a notice to the heirs of the late Asghar Khan after the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) last month suggested that the case relating to the implementation of the 2012 verdict be closed.

The 2012 SC verdict was issued on a petition filed in 1996 by Asghar Khan, requesting the top court to look into allegations that the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had secretly bankrolled many politicians in the 1990 elections by dishing out Rs140 million.

In the latest development, Khan's wife Amina Asghar Khan, his daughters Nasreen Ahmed Khattak and Sheereen Awan, and son Ali opposed the FIA's suggestion and highlighted what they perceived to be halfhearted efforts of the authorities.

""The late air marshal, Asghar Khan endeavored to cleanse the democratic process from unlawful interference by any person, military or civilian, no matter highly placed. This endeavor has not yet achieved fruition and a just end. Consequently, the family of late air marshal Asghar Khan seeks to continue his endeavor and opposes the closure of the inquiry sought by the FIA,"" said the written reply.

The family also sought conclusion of the trial against the military personal involved and the placement of the result of the trial before the people of Pakistan.

Citing the FIA's progress in the case, the reply mentioned it was clear that ""no attempt has been made by the FIA to approach for evidence the central figure retired Brig Hamid Saeed Akhtar, who had confessed before the court his personal role in carrying out the unlawful operation regarding disbursement of funds"" to various politicians and institutions before the general election of 1990.

The joint reply claimed that the Ministry of Defence did not support the FIA in execution of the court orders. ""In these circumstances, the request to close the inquiry and the case is unwarranted,"" it added.

Additionally, the family members expressed their concerns that ""more than six years after the final judgement of the apex court, proceedings against none of the military personnel involved in the matter, including retd Gen Aslam Baig and retd Gen Asad Durrani who had confessed their wrongdoing against the Constitution and the law, have been concluded"".

On Dec 29, 2018, the FIA had suggested that the apex court close the case relating to the implementation of the Asghar Khan verdict for want of concrete evidence. A report furnished before the court by the FIA stated that the authorities did not have enough evidence to launch a criminal prosecution against the individuals named in the judgement.

According to the FIA report, 18 politicians in their statements submitted in the SC denied receiving the funds to allegedly manipulate the 1990 polls.

The agency contended that the statements of witnesses recorded in the case so far had gaps and did not correlate with each other. Moreover, the investigation agency has also remained unsuccessful in securing financial records from the relevant banks since the matter is 24 years old.

Asghar Khan case

In 1996, Asghar Khan had filed a human rights petition in the SC, accusing the ISI of doling out money to a group of politicians in the 1990s.

The case was initiated by the air marshal after Benazir Bhutto's interior minister, retired general Naseerullah Babar, had claimed in the National Assembly in 1994 that the ISI had disbursed funds to ""purchase"" the loyalty of politicians and public figures so as to manipulate the 1990 elections, form the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), and bring about the defeat of the PPP.

Sixteen years after the petition was filed, the SC in its judgement — penned by then chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry — ruled that the 1990 general elections had been polluted by dishing out Rs140m to a particular group of politicians only to deprive the people of being represented by their chosen representatives.

The court had, however, thrown the ball back to the then PPP government by directing it to take necessary action under the Constitution and law against former army chief retired Gen Mirza Aslam Beg and former director general of ISI retired Lt Gen Asad Durrani for their role in facilitating the group of politicians and political parties to ensure their success against their rivals in the 1990 elections.

The usually vague regulatory authority got specific this time around and asked channels not to air dramas containing controversial themes, indecent clo­thing and gestures, controversial plots (involving infidelity and extramarital affairs, etc) and unnecessary details of events.

They say “indecent scenes, dialogues, extramarital relations, violence, inappropriate dressing, rape scenes, bed scenes, use of drugs and alcohol, and intimate moments between couples are being glamorised in utter disregard of Pakistani culture and values"" and are very distressing for viewers.

",2019-01-10,"Couple who was lynched over blasphemy accusations left behind three young children — one of whom witnessed the horror.

Members of the Christian community hold placards and wooden crosses during a demonstration to condemn the death of the Christian couple - AFP

Do you remember the ill-fated Shama and Shahzad Masih, the Christian couple from Kasur’s Kot Radha Kishan district in a brick kiln village called Chak 59?

The husband and wife – who was pregnant at the time – were falsely accused in 2014 of blasphemy, then lynched by a mob who first paraded them naked and then set them on fire.

Four years have passed since that terrifying ordeal.

As their legacy, the couple left behind a woeful tale of mob brutality, of the extreme misuse of the country’s controversial blasphemy laws – and even the question of the cruel treatment meted out to brick kiln workers who are modern day ‘slaves’.

But they also left behind three little children, who have now moved to the city, away from the horrors of the dusty, smoky brick kiln where their parents once worked.

Remembering Shama and Shahzad

Ten-year-old Suleman, the eldest of the three, was the only one to have seen what happened to his parents on that cursed day. His relatives, who are now the guardians of the children, say he was utterly shaken and deeply affected by the tragedy.

Poonam, who was just two years old at the time, had fallen down. Quick to act, their maternal aunt had picked her up and the other two children and had fled the scene before the mob turned on them.

“Suleman had bad dreams for a long time. He would often wake up screaming for his parents,” says Shama’s father, Mukhtiar Masih, who now has full custody of the three.

Even now the children are a little apprehensive when meeting strangers.

As if to prove a point he turns to them and asks blatantly “You remember Mama and Papa?” The children nod.

Something stirs in them. Suleman goes to the the cupboard, climbs to the top most shelf and takes out a banner with photographs of his deceased parents. It is the only picture he has of his father.

The media has been publishing the wrong picture of the couple. The woman in this picture is Shahzad's niece, who is alive and well.

“That’s him, that’s my father,” he says pointing to the picture of a thin, gaunt man, with a mustache and the trace of a stubble on his face.

“Ae Mama ni ai (This isn't Mummy),” says Sonia, her face falling slightly, as she looks at the woman. All three children speak only in Punjabi.

The media has erroneously been using a picture of Shahzad and another girl, captioning them as pictures of the couple. But the woman in the photo is Shahzad's niece, who is alive and well.

Ironically, it was the cruel end of their parents that helped break the shackles of bonded labour for the children.

Today, Suleman, 10, Sonia, 8, and Poonam, 6, go to school and try to live their lives like ordinary children — but forever haunted by the brutality of the day their parents were lynched.

A helping hand

The rehabilitation of these children would not be possible without the help of a small organisation working in Lahore known as the Cecil Chaudhry and Iris Foundation (CICF). Named after the veteran air-force hero Cecil Chaudhry and his wife, the organisation is run by their daughter Michelle Chaudhry.

Out of the several that flocked to help after the couple's murder in 2014, CICF was the only one that stayed aboard and continues to help the children to this day.

CICF organised a protest rally in order to demand Justice for the ill fated couple. Photo courtesy: CICF

“At first we gave them counselling because they were so afraid they would not go to anyone at all,” says Michelle Chaudhry.

“Later we helped them enroll in our school in Youhanabad. We gave them uniforms, stationery — literally everything that parents give their children. There was no one else.”

She says Suleman is now slowly gaining momentum, but despite everything, even now there are times when he goes into a daze.

“We have tried our best to help him emotionally and otherwise. He is doing much better, but because he actually witnessed the incident it is inevitable that he recalls it from time to time.

“They are all progressing well,” adds Michelle. “The other two children were only two and four years old, so they do not remember the loss of their parents as such. But when we first saw them, Sonia kept repeating the same sentence from time to time “Mummy papa nu saar dita” (they have burnt Mummy and Papa). Even for us, handling this was a heart-rending ordeal.”

Picking up the pieces

In school, the children are doing well.

“They have been getting top grades in class,” says Alyssa, who works in CICF.

“We are really very proud of them. And no one should be fooled by their shyness! These kids can be rowdy.”

“Suleman in school is one of the naughtiest boys around,” she says affectionately, glancing at him do his work. “He loves performing on stage.”

It is reassuring to see them get their academic life on track, but as time passes, the children’s needs will have to be reconsidered and this will pose to be an even bigger challenge for Michelle.

“They are people not a project,” she says. “If we took responsibility for them, we should continue with it.”

Right now the house they are living in is the property of the church, and has been given to them. It is not in their name.

“In any case we will be sending them to a boarding school eventually,” says Michelle, without taking the name of the school. “We want to groom them as much as possible. It has taken them four years to be accustomed to city life, but even now, they do not have the know-how that they should.”

This boarding school run by foreigners is located a little out of the city and Michelle is certain it will be good for Suleman.

“We are thinking of sending Suleman first as he is the eldest,” she says. “The girls are too little right now.”

Michelle says that she has to keep reminding people of them. “It’s only been four years and still people have more or less forgotten the incident, but I have to keep reminding them of the children. We get some donations which help.”

“It is an uncertain future, but we are with them all the way,” says Alyssa.

The reality is that Michelle has been paying for everything out of her own pocket.

“We are not getting any formal donations from anywhere,” she says. “We have to make sure that these children get their food, their clothes, their medical expenses, everything. It’s all done by us.”

Justice served

A total of 103 people had been charged in the case by ATC - AFP/File

According to one version of the story making rounds, the trigger point was when eight months pregnant Shama began to question the status of their peshgi, which she argued with the contractor, had already been paid. Peshgi is a kind of 'earnest payment' that labourers pay to take a loan; this often keeps them indebted to their employers. Peshgi is a system of bonded labour.

It was the same contractor who then lured the couple on the pretext of talking and locked them up in his office.

On the directions of the kiln owner, he told the neighbourhood cleric that Shama had been caught burning some Quranic verses. In reality they had been burning some documents that belonged to Shahzad’s recently deceased father who was a faith healer (aamil).

The cleric made an announcement that they have committed blasphemy, and within half an hour a mob of hundreds had collected at the kiln. The mob pulled the couple outside the locked room, and dragged them to the flames of the brick kiln.

Some reports say that it is unclear whether the couple had been alive when they had been burnt. But one thing is certain: there was nothing left of them to bury.

The case dominated national news and sparked a global outcry. A top Vatican official described the lynching as a ""humiliation for all of humanity"".

The case was instantly sent to an anti-terrorism court (ATC), and a total of 103 people were charged. In November 2016, five men were sentenced to death, including Yusuf Gujjar the kiln owner – sentences that are currently under appeal in the ATC – while 10 others were given varying jail terms for playing a supportive role in the killings.

The same court also acquitted 93 suspects in the case in 2016.

The lawyer for the family Riaz Anjum said that the five people who were awarded the death sentence were involved in dragging, beating and burning the couple.",dawn,"['couple', 'lynched', 'blasphemy',

",2019-01-10,"President Arif Alvi has accepted the resignation of Azam Swati, the former Federal Minister for Science and Technology, it emerged on Thursday.

Swati, a member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, had resigned from the ministry last month to ""uphold moral authority"" in the face of a probe over allegations that he played a role in the 'unlawful' transfer of former Islamabad police chief Jan Mohammad.

A notification issued by the Cabinet Division dated Jan 9 said that the president had, upon the advice of Prime Minister Imran Khan, accepted the PTI leader's resignation with effect from Dec 6.

The former IGP's transfer took place after Swati’s son registered a case against a family of slum dwellers for allegedly trespassing on his family’s land. Five people, including two women, were arrested for trespassing on the land and beating up Swati’s guards. They were released after a day’s detention as police said a settlement had been reached between the minister and the detained family.

On November 19, a court-formed joint investigation team had held Swati and his employees responsible for the altercation that took place at his farmhouse and allegedly transpired into the police chief's transfer.

The Supreme Court in the last hearing of the case had referred a matter relating to the alleged amassing of wealth beyond known sources of income by Swati to the Federal Board of Revenue as well as the Islamabad police for a comprehensive probe.

On December 21, Zaman, in his petition, had accused Zardari of owning an apartment in Belaire Condomi­niums located at 524 East 72nd Street, New York, but not declaring it in his nomination papers for the 2018 general elections. He had subsequently moved the ECP seeking Zardari's disqualification from the National Assembly.

Zaman, on the instruction of ECP member from Sindh Abdul Ghaffar Soomro, submitted a handwritten request, saying: ""I want to take this case to the Supreme Court because I believe the evidences I have acquired [...] are pivotal and in the best interest of Pakistan.""

He later held a media talk outside the ECP office in which he claimed to have found more evidence against Asif Zardari. ""The evidence has been verified. Our preparation is complete,"" he said.

265,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456659/editorial-extending-military-courts-again,"Editorial: Extending military courts, again?
",2019-01-10,"AMONG the many distortions introduced in the Constitution, a number of which have been reversed and corrected over the decades, the two amendments to introduce and extend the life of military courts for civilians accused of terrorism by the state must surely rank as some of the most consequential.

Approved by a democratically elected parliament and supported by the two largest political parties in the country, the 21st and 23rd amendments to the Constitution have, in fact, disturbed the democratic order, with the fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan eroded by the very representatives of the people. That institutions of the state may have demanded and sanctified military courts underlined the extent of the state’s drift from a rights-based and freedom-maximising interpretation of the Constitution. Resistance was needed, but none was evident.

Now, a second consecutive parliament is on the verge of taking up the issue of military courts — once again to extend the life of these courts, rather than to disband them and take up the matter of urgent judicial reform.

What is perplexing is that the PTI — which has signalled that it will consult with the opposition to reach the necessary numbers in parliament to approve another constitutional amendment to extend the life of military courts — has an explicit reforms-based governance and legislative agenda.

The incoming chief justice of the Supreme Court is highly regarded as one of the best criminal law justices in the country. Surely, then, now is the time for parliament along with the judicial institution and other relevant bodies to take up the matter of criminal law reform in the country.

Military-court trials for civilians accused of terrorism were justified on the basis of a national emergency and a need to have an instrument to punish the very worst terrorists captured by the state. But the Army Public School attack, in the wake of which military courts were activated, occurred more than four years ago. Unquestionably, the security situation in the country today is much improved.

More relevantly, a recent Peshawar High Court judgment that set aside the convictions of more than 70 individuals tried in military courts has exposed the intrinsic and very serious problems of fairness, due process and justice itself in the operation of such courts.

The PHC judgment has been suspended on appeal in the Supreme Court, but it has laid bare enough troubling problems with the operation of military courts that an extension to the life of these courts ought not to be considered at this moment. Instead of perpetuating injustice, the PTI-led government must turn its attention to addressing continuing problems such as missing persons.

The fight against militancy, terrorism and violent extremism will of necessity be long. But the country must not lose its constitutional, democratic and fundamental-rights moorings in the process.

",2019-01-10,"An accountability court on Thursday indicted former federal minister Dr Arbab Alamgir and his wife Asma Alamgir, a former MNA, in a reference accusing them of possessing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has alleged that both the suspects accumulated assets to the tune of Rs332 million, which were disproportionate to their known sources of income.

The couple, belonging to Pakistan People’s Party, have repeatedly claimed innocence and stated that all their assets were acquired through known sources.

While rejecting the charges against them, Asma said their assets have been in the family for the past 200 years.

""We even disclosed the properties that were not in our name,"" said Arbab, while his wife claimed that ""NAB has turned into a joke of an institution"".

While criticising NAB, Asma said, ""The LDA reference against the Punjab Assembly speaker has been shut while we have been indicted in court. Why does the law that applied to Pervez Elahi speaker not apply to anyone else?""

""When I — being a woman — can come to the court myself, why can't those hiding under the umbrella of the law like Pervez Khattak and Mehmood Khan do the same?""

The court summoned four witnesses on January 24 to commence the trial.

NAB's reference

NAB claimed that during investigation it was revealed that both of the suspects had accumulated huge assets worth millions of rupees disproportionate to their income.

As per the reference, the inquiry was authorised on November 4, 2015 and was subsequently converted into investigation with the approval of NAB executive board on January 12, 2018.

NAB alleged that during investigation, it surfaced that the suspects accumulated movable and immovable assets including a house in G-11/3 Islamabad; 10-kanal land at Mauza Shah Alladitta, Islamabad; a bungalow in F-7/2 Islamabad; prize bonds; a land rover vehicle and several bank transactions.

NAB claimed that the reference was pertaining to the assets in Pakistan whereas a supplementary reference regarding their foreign assets would be filed after receipt of documentary evidence through Mutual Legal Assistance from foreign countries.

On November 8, 2018, the Peshawar High Court had disposed of a writ petition filed by Asma Alamgir against issuance of frequent call-up notices to her by NAB.

267,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456656/sc-rejects-rao-anwars-petition-to-have-his-name-removed-from-ecl,"SC rejects Rao Anwar's petition to have his name removed from ECL
",2019-01-10,"The Supreme Court on Thursday turned down former Malir Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Rao Anwar's petition to have his name removed from the exit control list (ECL).

Anwar is accused of being involved in the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud — an aspiring model and shopkeeper from South Waziristan — and others in a fake police encounter in Karachi, but is currently out on bail.

Dawn Investigation: Rao Anwar and the killing fields of Karachi

He had petitioned the court to have his name removed from the ECL on account of performing Umrah and attending the wedding of his daughter abroad.

At the outset of the case today, Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar questioned Anwar's counsel as to how his client was out of jail despite being accused of murder.

""Rao Anwar was an absconder,"" Justice Nisar noted, referring to the former policeman's infamous disappearance in the wake of the emergence of allegations against him.

""How did he [Anwar] get acquitted?""

""Rao Anwar wasn't acquitted; he is out on bail,"" the counsel replied. ""His family lives abroad. He wants to meet them and also wants to perform Umrah with his family.""

The chief justice suggested that Anwar's family be called to Pakistan as he set aside the petition.

""Confiscate Rao Anwar's petition,"" the top judge ordered. ""He has killed a young boy. Until the trial is over, Rao Anwar will stay in Pakistan.""

The chief justice rubbished Anwar's justification for seeking ECL exit, saying that the actual purpose of the petition is to ""deposit abroad the wealth looted from here"".

Furthermore, Justice Nisar said that ""this bench knows how Rao Anwar was arrested"".

""He was provided all facilities during his arrest,"" he added.

Naqeebullah case

Naqeebullah Mehsud was among four people killed in an encounter on January 13. While Anwar had claimed that all four of the men killed, allegedly on his orders, belonged to the terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), social media had erupted in protest against Mehsud's killing after it was found that he was an aspiring model.

The tainted police officer had gone into hiding soon after demands for his arrest in the Naqeebullah murder case had gained traction. A police JIT had then found the encounter was staged.

Anwar had then resurfaced in a dramatic manner at the Supreme Court, after repeated pleas from the chief justice, from where he was subsequently arrested.

Soon after his arrest, his house in Malir Cantonment was declared a sub-jail. He had later moved an application for provision of better class facilities in the sub-jail. The court had accepted Anwar's application for better facilities, including an exemption from being handcuffed.

In July 2018, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) had ruled that Anwar was not present at the time Naqeebullah and three others were extrajudicially killed in an alleged ‘staged’ encounter. A week later, the ATC had granted bail to Anwar.",Haseeb Bhatti,"['supreme', 'court', 'thursday', 'turned', 'former', 'malir', 'senior', 'superintendent', 'police', 'ssp', 'rao', 'anwar', 'petition', 'name', 'removed', 'exit', 'control', 'list', 'ecl', 'anwar', 'accused', 'involved', 'murder', 'naqeebullah', 'mehsud', 'aspiring', 'model', 'shopkeeper', 'south', 'waziristan', 'others', 'fake', 'police', 'encounter', 'karachi', 'currently', 'bail', 'dawn', 'investigation', 'rao', 'anwar', 'killing', 'fields', 'karachi', 'petitioned', 'court', 'name', 'removed', 'ecl', 'account', 'performing', 'umrah', 'attending', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'abroad', 'outset', 'case', 'today', 'chief', 'justice', 'pakistan', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'questioned', 'anwar', 'counsel', 'client', 'jail', 'despite', 'accused', 'murder', 'rao', 'anwar', 'absconder', 'justice', 'nisar', 'noted', 'referring', 'former', 'policeman', 'infamous', 'disappearance', 'wake', 'emergence', 'allegations', 'anwar', 'get', 'acquitted', 'rao', 'anwar', 'nt', 'acquitted', 'bail', 'counsel', 'replied', 'family', 'lives', 'abroad', 'wants', 'meet', 'also', 'wants', 'perform', 'umrah', 'family', 'chief', 'justice', 'suggested', 'anwar', 'family', 'called', 'pakistan', 'set', 'aside', 'petition', 'confiscate', 'rao', 'anwar', 'petition', 'top', 'judge', 'ordered', 'killed', 'young', 'boy', 'trial', 'rao', 'anwar', 'stay', 'pakistan', 'chief', 'justice', 'rubbished', 'anwar', 'justification', 'seeking', 'ecl', 'exit', 'saying', 'actual', 'purpose', 'petition', 'deposit', 'abroad', 'wealth', 'looted', 'furthermore', 'justice', 'nisar', 'said', 'bench', 'knows', 'rao', 'anwar', 'arrested', 'provided', 'facilities', 'arrest', 'added', 'naqeebullah', 'case', 'naqeebullah', 'mehsud', 'among', 'four', 'people', 'killed', 'encounter', 'january', '13', 'anwar', 'claimed', 'four', 'men', 'killed', 'allegedly', 'orders', 'belonged', 'terrorist', 'outfit', 'tehreekitaliban', 'pakistan', 'ttp', 'social', 'media', 'erupted', 'protest', 'mehsud', 'killing', 'found', 'aspiring', 'model', 'tainted', 'police', 'officer', 'gone', 'hiding', 'soon', 'demands', 'arrest', 'naqeebullah', 'murder', 'case', 'gained', 'traction', 'police', 'jit', 'found', 'encounter', 'staged', 'anwar', 'resurfaced', 'dramatic', 'manner', 'supreme', 'court', 'repeated', 'pleas', 'chief', 'justice', 'subsequently', 'arrested', 'soon', 'arrest', 'house', 'malir', 'cantonment', 'declared', 'subjail', 'later', 'moved', 'application', 'provision', 'better', 'class', 'facilities', 'subjail', 'court', 'accepted', 'anwar', 'application', 'better', 'facilities', 'including', 'exemption', 'handcuffed', 'july', '2018', 'antiterrorism', 'court', 'atc', 'ruled', 'anwar', 'present', 'time', 'naqeebullah', 'three', 'others', 'extrajudicially', 'killed', 'alleged', 'staged', 'encounter', 'week', 'later', 'atc', 'granted', 'bail', 'anwar']","['sc', 'rejects', 'rao', 'anwar', 'petition', 'name', 'removed', 'ecl']"

",2019-01-10,"CHARSADDA: As part of the ongoing efforts to find a political settlement to the four decades long war in Afghanistan, a delegation of Afghan government called on Awami National Party president Asfandyar Wali Khan here on Wednesday.

Afghanistan’s High Peace Council Chairman Mohammad Omar Daudzai was heading the delegation that also included Afghan Ambassador Atif Mashal, said a statement issued from Wali Bagh.

The statement said that the delegation conveyed goodwill message of Afghan President Dr Ashraf Ghani to Mr Wali and appreciated the efforts of ANP for restoration of peace in the war-torn country.

ANP provincial general secretary Sardar Hussain Babak told Dawn that the visit of the delegation was part of the ongoing efforts to find a political solution to the conflict that had been affecting both Pakistan and Afghanistan. He said that ANP’s stance was clear as the party always supported political settlement of the conflict.

Mr Babak said that the delegation was likely to hold meetings with leaders of other political parties in Pakistan and government.

The Wali Bagh’s statement said that Asfandyar Wali Khan told the delegation that talks could not be successful without the inclusion of the Afghan government. “The so-called Islamic State (IS) may not be controlled in case of unilateral agreement with Taliban and it will indulge the region in another war,” the statement quoted Mr Khan as saying.

He said that Afghan government should lead the ongoing peace talks being held in different countries. He said that without the involvement of government in Kabul, the efforts for peace would remain meaningless.

He said that Russia and China should play the role of guarantors in the peace talks.

He said that Taliban, Pakistan and the US administration should not ignore the Afghan government in the whole process. “This region will become another Syria if the peace talks fail,” said Mr Khan.

269,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456653/disrupted-south-africa-seek-clean-sweep-in-test-series-against-pakistan,"Disrupted South Africa seek clean sweep in Test series against Pakistan
",2019-01-10,"Despite being without suspended captain Faf du Plessis, South Africa will be pushing for a clean sweep when they play Pakistan in the third and final Test starting at the Wanderers Stadium on Friday.

Opening batsman Dean Elgar was announced as stand-in captain on Wednesday after Du Plessis was suspended for one match after South Africa fell short of the required over rate during their nine-wicket win in the second Test at Newlands.

The loss of Du Plessis will inevitably disrupt South Africa's plans. He has led South Africa to 17 wins in his 27 Tests in charge and was named man of the match after scoring a century at Newlands.

Speaking on Sunday before the ban was announced, Du Plessis said South Africa were determined to keep the pressure on Pakistan and win the series 3-0.

Du Plessis is likely to be replaced in the batting order by Zubayr Hamza, 23, who will become South Africa's 100th Test player since the country returned to international cricket in 1991.

Hamza has been part of the squad throughout the series, primarily to gain experience in the national team set-up. He got a taste of Test cricket in front of his home crowd at Newlands when he took a good catch at fine leg as a substitute fielder. Hamza has a career first-class batting average of 49.29.

A second change in an already fragile batting line-up may be necessary, with opening batsman Aiden Markram facing a fitness test on Thursday after suffering a right thigh injury which prevented him from batting in the second innings at Newlands. Uncapped Pieter Malan, a teammate of Hamza at the Cape Cobras franchise, is on standby.

Du Plessis's ban may also cause South Africa to question the wisdom of fielding an all-seam bowling attack, which inevitably puts pressure on over rates. The Wanderers is the ground where South Africa have most often fielded four fast bowlers and left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj has only played in one of a possible three Tests at the ground since becoming a regular member of the squad.

The pitch received a ""poor"" rating from the International Cricket Council after a Test against India last season. A repeat would cause the ground to be barred from staging international matches for a year and it seems unlikely the surface will again be prepared to give an undue advantage to fast bowlers.

Pakistan's batting has been inadequate against South Africa's fast bowling, although Shan Masood, Imamul Haq, Asad Shafiq and Babar Azam have all played useful innings. The bowlers, too, were disappointing at Newlands, so it seems likely there will be changes.

But the options for the tourists are limited. Shadab Khan and Faheem Ashraf could both come into consideration as all-rounders after Pakistan's four specialist bowlers were worn down during South Africa's first innings of 431 at Newlands.

",2019-01-10,"Noted Pashto folk singer from Kurram tribal district, Naeemullah Turi, has said that Pashto folk music with purposeful poetry content has a bright future that should contribute to the cause of peace, humanism and universal brotherhood.

The worst law and order situation in tribal districts a few years ago had forced him to move to Islamabad, but he remained associated with folk music.

The new Pashto album with music composition of Zar Mohammad Zaru Ustad would help revive the traditional Pashto music orchestra – rabab, tabla, harmonium, flute and saxophone. The online version would also be available after a week, said the singer.

Mr Turi has recently released his 16th Pashto album attracting audience’s attention owing to its quality music and poetry. He has a large following in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Afghanistan, and Gulf countries.

Commercialism has robbed originality of art, he said, adding that he used the art of singing for a social cause to motivate others to contribute to the society through their talent.

In a chat with this scribe on Wednesday on the occasion of his 16th Pashto album release, Mr Turi said that though the Pashto music charts had lost its glint over the last few years, folk music with a substance still had circle of tasteful audience and therefore it had a bright future despite lackluster music scene.

“My new Pashto album ‘Zmaka’ (homeland) would register its impact due to traditional music composition and quality poetry content as the poetry I selected has a strong message for my fans and audience at large. The title of my album symbolises love for our homeland, culture and its people,” he said.

Mr Turi said that his new album included poetic pieces of Saadullah Jan Barq, Ali Akbar Sial, Rashid Khattak and Saud Bangash whose impact on audience had been well established due to their creative and genuine thoughts. He said that these Pashto poets enjoyed a good reputation among literary circles for their substance.

Mr Turi belonged to Kas Bilayameen village of Kurram district and ran his property business and also looked after two orphanages, one each in his village and Islamabad. He had done his master’s in Social Work in 1997 from the University of Peshawar.

He said that he had learnt basics of music from Humayoun Sakhi, a noted rabab player now based in US, and also benefited from other music maestros.

“I had launched my music career in 2006 by bringing out my maiden album carrying poetic pieces of nationalist poet, Rahmat Shah Sail. I have sung the Kalam of Khushal Khan Khattak, Hamza Baba, Fazle Subhan Abid, and a few other poets. I strongly believe that pop singers would turn to traditional music because it appeals to both heart and mind,” Mr Turi stated.

Maas Khan, a music director while commenting on the new Pashto album, said that Turi’s way of expression and choice of poetry shot him to fame.

He said that the poetry contents corresponded well with the music composition and would motivate other folk singers to follow in his footsteps.

",2019-01-10,"INDICATIONS that the government is planning to act proactively in addressing the grievances of the minority communities can only be welcomed.

Fortunately, no time-consuming inquiry is needed to ascertain the nature and extent of minorities’ plight; much that should be done to ameliorate their lot is known. For several years, minorities in Pakistan have been agitating for the implementation of former chief justice of Pakistan Tasadduq Husain Jilani’s judgment of June 2014.

In the judgment he authored, the apex court issued eight directions that called for (i) creation of a taskforce to develop a strategy for promoting religious tolerance; (ii) curricula reform for fostering religious and social tolerance; (iii) steps to discourage hate speech in the media and action against offenders; (iv) creation of a national council for minorities; (v) training of a special police force to protect minorities’ places of worship; (vi) implementation of the 5 per cent job quota for minorities; (vii) registration of cases for violation of minorities’ rights or desecration of their places of worship; and (viii) creation of a three-member bench of the Supreme Court to ensure compliance with the directions and to entertain complaints of violations of minorities’ fundamental rights.

No time-consuming inquiry is needed to ascertain the nature and extent of their plight.

Some of these directions (such as the creation a taskforce on religious tolerance, formation of a national council for minorities, implementation of the job quota, and registration of cases of violations of rights and desecration of places of worship) could be promptly implemented, while curricula reform and training of a special police force were bound to take time. A special bench of the Supreme Court started working soon after the judgment was delivered, and it did ask the government a few times for reports, but the heavy workload perhaps affected the pace of its work. The government’s failure to act upon the court’s directions caused considerable frustration among the minority communities.

That the task of ensuring compliance was assigned to a bench of the Supreme Court is one of the significant features of the verdict. Secondly, it has been accepted by the minority communities as a charter of their rights, at least for the time being. Aggrieved by the administration’s habitual tardiness, three civil society organisations approached the Supreme Court last year to persuade the government to fulfil its obligations, and the chief justice of Pakistan appointed Dr Shoaib Suddle as a one-man commission to report compliance priorities. The commission’s work has been hampered by lack of facilities. This week on Tuesday, the Supreme Court declared it would soon issue an order, which will hopefully be implemented forthwith.

A Bishop’s testimony

Meanwhile, the minorities’ case for their rightful place in Pakistan has been ably argued by Bishop Emeritus of Lahore Dr Alexander John Malik in his recently published book, My Pakistan: The Story of a Bishop.

The author uses the expression ‘my Pakistan’ because he has opted to live in this country by a deliberate choice. In 1972, he gave up his PhD studies in Canada in response to a call from the church to return home. He defied family pressure to stay on in Canada by declaring: “Pakistan is my country. I need to be there both for my Lord and for Pakistan.”

In this memoir, he devotes only a few pages to the story of his life, his election as the bishop of Lahore in 1980 while still a few days short of his 39th birthday, and his 32 years in that office. The rest of the book is a chronicle of what Pakistan’s minorities have done for their country, and how they have suffered because of the state’s deviation from its ideal as defined by the Quaid-i-Azam.

While describing the Christian community’s role in the establishment of Pakistan, he does not confine himself to their vote in favour of bringing Punjab into Pakistan, he offers the evidence collected by a number of writers to show Christian solidarity with Punjab’s Muslims during the 1920s and 1930s, their opposition to the partition of Punjab, and their plea before the Boundary Commission to be counted with the Muslims.

He then recalls the Christian community’s services to Pakistan in the field of education and defence, and claims: “Proportionally, the number of Christian martyrs outnumbered all others in the defence of Pakistan.” As against the services rendered by minorities, he notes: “In 70 years of Pakistan’s history, due to the inclusion of Islamic clauses in the constitution – especially during Zia’s era – the status of minorities as citizens has drastically changed from what the father of the nation had envisaged.” After referring to discrimination against minorities in the Constitution, in admission to educational institutions and services, and the tribulations caused by the blasphemy law, the author gives an account of violence against minorities from 1997 to 2012.

Bishop Malik argues that, despite curtailment of minorities’ rights, “their love for and their commitment to serving Pakistan have in no way diminished”. He recalls the Parsi community’s contribution to the economy and culture, and the Christian community’s contribution in the fields of education, health and defence.

It was not easy for the bishop to avoid a conflict between his service to his Lord and his pledge to serve Pakistan. When over a dozen worshippers were massacred in a Bahawalpur church in 2001, he curbed the urge to blame the government or the people for the outrage by describing the loss of Christian lives as a sacrifice for their faith. His efforts to build the St Thomas Church in Islamabad and the St Denys’ High School in Murree — after it had been burnt down twice — are in sharp contrast with our failure to quickly rebuild the girls’ schools destroyed by extremists. There is a lesson in this for Muslim Pakistanis who need to maintain a balance in their duties to the faith and to the state.

Bishop Malik’s plea for due recognition of the fundamental rights of Pakistan’s minority communities commands respect because he is reasonable, non-partisan and moderate in tone.

272,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456649/govt-borrows-rs224tr-in-5-months-whats-the-reality-behind-the-seemingly-alarming-figure,"'Govt borrows Rs2.24tr in 5 months': What's the reality behind the seemingly alarming figure?
",2019-01-10,"ONE headline from the current week has ricocheted around the national conversation in problematic ways. The headline was the one announcing that government borrowing increased by Rs2.24 trillion in the first five months of the fiscal year, according to data released by the State Bank on Monday.

On the face of it, the figure is alarming. Opponents of the government, as well as headline-hungry TV anchors, seized on it to make all sorts of analytical claims that the government has lost control of its fiscal effort and is borrowing in record amounts to make up for its failure to mobilise revenues.

A closer look reveals a different reality. Let’s put it in plain English first: almost half of the Rs2.24tr of borrowing in the July-November period is accounted for by the devaluation of the rupee, which caused the rupee value of external debt to shoot up. How do we figure this? Very easily, with a little bit of basic maths. Let me explain.

This is not the only time basic numerical literacy is required before launching an analytical ship into unknown waters.

The news gave us three data points. The total debt of the country rose by Rs2.24tr in five months, of which Rs907 billion was domestic debt and Rs1.334tr was external debt. At the end of the period under review, the total external debt was Rs9.13tr, the data release said.

Now do some elementary algebra. The total external debt at the start of the period under review (July) would be Rs7.796tr (that’s 9.13 minus 1.334). From one link on the State Bank website, you can see that the rupee fell by 15.5 per cent (from 121.5 to 140.3 to a dollar) in this time period. So what is 15.5pc of 7.796tr? The answer is 1.208, which is the amount by which our external debt, when denominated in rupees, shot up simply because of the devaluation of the rupee.

Next question: if Rs1.334tr was the total increase in external debt, how much of that is accounted for by the devaluation of the rupee? The answer is 90pc. And if the total increase in debt was Rs2.24tr, then how much of the total increase is accounted for by the devaluation of the rupee? The answer is 54pc.

This is not the only time such basic numerical literacy is required before launching an analytical ship into unknown waters. An accomplished historian of the interwar years, E.H. Carr, once wrote an interesting little booklet titled What is History? The simple title showed that he was writing about a subject that had been sucked into very intense partisan debates in a sharply polarised environment. When writing about the old school of history writing — some called it the Whig interpretation of history, which focused on a straight narrative telling of the facts as the historian’s primary job — he said it may be true that nothing speaks louder than facts, “but facts don’t speak for themselves, they only speak when they are called upon”.

It is very similar with numbers and data. Numbers are an integral part of the story. They describe the story, give it proportions and make its contours comparable to other places and times — but they are not the story itself. The story itself is the context in which the number has been produced. Sometimes that context is heavily political, and sometimes it requires other numbers to build.

For example, when you hear one political party saying “the GDP growth rate was higher in our time than it was in yours”, you should know that you are hearing a very political interpretation of a number. A high GDP growth rate may or may not be a good thing, first of all (it depends on the composition of the growth and how it has been achieved, among many other things); and even if one period sees higher growth, it could well lend itself in significant ways to work that was done long before the ruling party came into office.

For another example, take another headline that fluttered past recently, also related to debt. This one announced that the government borrowing from the State Bank between July and September surged past Rs5.4tr. This is alarming because borrowing from the State Bank is synonymous with the printing of money, which is highly inflationary and would denote that the government has run out of options to finance its operations and is basically printing money to pay its bills.

But this is one of those examples where the number by itself does not tell you the whole story. You will have to look at where this number has stood over a longer period of time to understand what is really going on. In other words, you will need other numbers to unlock the story.

Consider that total stock of government borrowing from the State Bank stood at Rs5.348tr in the first week of July 2018 — long before this government came in. A week earlier, it was Rs3.668tr, meaning it leapt by Rs1.68tr in one week. Sounds sensational, doesn’t it?

Not really, because from that spike of July 6, it declined steadily to reach Rs3.607tr by Aug 24, back to where it was end-June, if not slightly lower. Then it climbed again to hit a peak of Rs6.859tr by Nov 30, an increase of 90pc in three months. But then it fell again to Rs5.104tr by end-December, which is the latest figure available.

It should be obvious what is going on : government borrowing from the State Bank rises and ebbs in a quarterly cycle to accommodate short-term government liquidity requirements. Picking up one data point from the great cycle to build spectacular announcements upon is a highly misleading presentation of the facts.

A good rule of thumb to follow is: always be suspicious of a story built around a single number. Look for somebody who knows the right context and the right series into which to place that number before making up your mind. Politics is everywhere, but reality is sacred. Let’s work to preserve it.

",2019-01-10,"ONE of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s key goals for ‘tabdeeli’ (change) was good governance through civil service reforms. He inducted two former bureaucrats as his advisers — Shehzad Arbab and Dr Ishrat Husain — on Establishment Division and Institutional Reforms and Austerity, respectively to deliver on the goal.

Mr Shehzad himself is a retired officer of the District Management Group (DMG) now renamed as Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS), while Dr Ishrat Husain, an economist of known acclaim, is working on the task with a team of mostly senior bureaucrats.

A common perception is that most governance and administrative reform efforts have faced resistance from civil servants themselves and primarily from amongst the DMG or PAS officers.

“No one should be a judge in their own case.” Dr Nadeem-ul-Haque, the former deputy chairman planning commission, who spearheaded the last reform effort still repents that the transport monetisation reform was hijacked and misused by DMG officers in the absence of an effective media and civil society to act as watchdogs.

Former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, while underpinning civil service reforms in the early 70’s, lucidly expressed frustration over the bureaucracy’s love for status quo when he said: “No institution in the country has so lowered the quality of our national life as what is called the ‘naukarshahi’ (bureaucracy).

“It has created a class of Brahmins or Mandarins unrivalled in its snobbery and arrogance, insulated from the life of the people and incapable of identifying itself with them.”

Mr Bhutto may have made a correct estimation of the bureaucracy’s repulsion for, and resistance against, reform and taken measures to overcome this phenomenon. Yet some of his reforms have been successfully buried by the bureaucracy in the pages of Esta Code — a code that defines the terms and conditions of service — for the last five decades.

The former premier had introduced a system of accelerated promotion of lower-eligible employees of each service group to BS-17 through a departmental examination and a lateral entry system. Outside talent, from other service groups as well as the private sector, could now find their way into any service group.

These two reforms were targeted at and sought to demolish the tall walls that sequestered and segregated different service groups, thereby crystallising them into monopolies of vested interests, decaying from inside and still closed to outside talent.

Dr Ishrat Husain criticises the civil service reforms introduced by Mr Bhutto in the early 1970s, and by Mr Musharraf in the early 2000s, in his book ‘Governing the Ungovernable’.

Spelling out the reasons for his criticism of Mr Bhutto’s and Mr Musharraf’s reforms, Mr Husain writes on page 217 that ‘these reforms curtailed the autonomy and supremacy of the civil service of Pakistan. Policies were now being outlined by elected representatives, a significant of demotion for civil service.’

This apparently runs counter to Prime Minister Khan’s recent speeches that policymaking is appropriately the domain of elected representatives and that bureaucracy is required only to implement that policy.

Mr Ishrat Husain, while tracing the causes of decay and decline in civil service, puts the blame on loss of constitutional protection, eroded glory and low compensation of civil servants. He tends to downplay the dangerous mismatch between the bureaucracy’s authority and accountability as the cause of civil service’s apathy to performance and its indifference to the common man’s life.

Mr Husain criticises superior courts’ power of judicial review. He suggests promotions in the civil service on the basis of almost the same criteria which have already found their way into the Establishment Division’s successive office memorandums.

The fate of Mr Khan’s civil service reforms may be similar to those enacted in the past

He conceives a National Executive Service that appears to be almost a replica of the present Secretariat Service and recommends phasing out several service groups from the present CSS while retaining the Pakistan Administrative Service and a couple of others.

These recommendations point at undermining the bureaucracy’s accountability and further consolidating the hold of one service group over all others.

On the contrary, different people, committees and commissions, local as well as foreign, that have studied the problems of Pakistan’s civil service and recommended remedial measures from the early 1950s to early 1970s, took a different direction.

Mr Bernard Gladieux, a US consultant hired by Pakistan in the 1950s, remarked that ‘regardless of their personal and professional qualifications, no democracy can afford to entrust its administrative destiny to any single cadre or group, class or service. To do so is to run the risk of creating and maintaining a civil service oligarchy. He believed the technical and professional officers also had administrative expertise and should be given top positions.

Yet, the Pakistan Engineering Council claims that more than 40 per cent of positions dedicated for engineering experts were currently occupied by non-engineers, mostly from administrative cadres because of their deep rooted influence, nullifying the principle of right man for the right job. One of the results is the Rs1.5 trillion energy sector circular debt, PEC claims.

The Pay and Service Commission presided over by Justice Cornelius had concluded that the normal method of claiming the right to occupy a post in public service should be proving competence to do so and not on the basis of reservation or vested rights in favour of a certain section coming down from the period of colonial rule.

The fate of Imran Khan’s reforms may be similar to those enacted in the past unless the elected representatives, assisted by outside experts, take charge and reform the civil service into a unified whole in which talent and competence, liberated from the confines of ‘groups’ and ‘services’, rise to the top, leaving the dead wood behind.

",2019-01-10,"PESHAWAR: Lack of funds, pledged by health department, has been hampering the operations of accident and emergency department at Khyber Teaching Hospital to a desired level, according to sources.

They said that the department was partially started in September last year but it was yet to offer any relief to the patients because of shortage of staff and equipment.

“The ground floor of the seven-storey building has become operational but it has not made any difference as far as improvement in emergency services to the patients is concerned,” they added.

Finance dept fails to release Rs1.62bn for purchase of equipment

Sources said that the building was completed at the cost of Rs1.3billion on August 31, 2018. They said that a PC-1 of Rs2.71 billion was submitted to finance department on August 1, 2018 for purchase of equipment but the amount was yet to be released.

On the cabinet’s approval in December 2017, the finance department agreed to release an amount of Rs1.62 billion for equipment but the amount was not released despite completion of the procurement process. The suppliers were not willing to supply the equipment without being paid, said sources.

In this connection, two reminders were sent to finance department on May 21 and June 24 to release the fund but these were yet to be responded. The finance department agreed to give Rs350 million, including Rs100 million for CT scan and Rs250 million for MRI, on the directives of Peshawar High Court on September 26 2018, but the amount was released only for CT scan.

Health Secretary Dr Syed Farooq Jamil told Dawn that a meeting held with chief minister in the chair recently decided to make the department fully operational within three months.

“We have asked the KTH administration to make a plan for a phase-wise release of the required amount of RsRs1.6 billion. We are waiting for the response,” he said.

The state-of-the-art facility was meant to have all services required by seriously-ill and wounded. But it is yet to get the desired staff and equipment.

It is the second accident and emergency department after that of the Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar that was designed to have its own wards to provide prompt services to the patients.

The department was partially launched because the old A&ED at the hospital was too small to cater to the needs of patients.

It already faced delay in completion of construction owing to non-availability of funds. Its construction was begun in 2009 but was completed last year.

According to the plan, the A&ED, if provided with staff and instruments, would have women and children wards. The building located inside the hospital is accessible to patients from all sides, especially from Khyber tribal district. It would reduce the load of patients on Hayatabad Medical Complex and LRH.

Now, there are only stop-gap arrangements and staffers of the hospital have been deputed there. It required posts of emergency and trauma specialists besides paramedics and nurses, who would be deployed exclusively for the serious patients.

It will have full-fledged neurosurgery, spinal cord surgery and cardiology department besides the facility of lab to ensure provision of quick services to the people with heart ailments.

A big parking lot vaving120-car capacity and 150-seat auditorium have also been established there.

The department will have its own investigative services including ultrasound, X-rays, minor operating theatre, CT scan facilities and pathological services besides mortuary and cafeteria.

A trauma hall at the A&ED will have the capacity to accommodate 100 patients on the ground floor to cope with mass emergencies.

",2019-01-10,"HARIPUR: Federal minister for science and technology Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui has said the government considers the Telephone Industries of Pakistan to be an important national asset and therefore, it will revive it as a profit making unit.

The minister told reporters during a visit to the TIP premises here on Wednesday that the TIP had state-of-the-art infrastructure, which would be used to meet the country’s needs for telephones, mobile phones and energy meters.

He said his visit was meant to find out ways and means to revive the TIP, develop production plan and learn about the current and future market trends.

The minister said the execution of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project had increased the chances of the TIP’s revival and therefore, the government would utilise its all possible resources to revitalise that sick unit.

He said he would discuss with federal minister for energy Omar Ayub Khan the use of the TIP’s energy meters by the Wapda.

The minister said the factors, which turned the TIP into a non-productive industrial unit, would be properly assessed, while its trained manpower would be engaged for future projects on priority basis. He also promised the creation of new job opportunities.

TIP managing director Taimur Khan earlier briefed the minister about the facility’s production, liabilities and future potential.

NO TRUST MOTION: More than 50 members of the Haripur district council will formally move the no trust motion against nazim Adil Islam today (Thursday).

The session was called by the naib nazim, who had received the motion signed by 50 councillors on Jan 4.

Councillor Asif Ali Jah, who signed the motion, alleged that the nazim was involved in corruption, worked against the PTI on whose ticket he was elected the nazim, had a conflict with the entire district machinery, failed to attend the house as required by the law, behaved badly with members, and distributed funds among council members unequally.

He said of the total 68 members, around 57 had vowed on oath to remove the nazim.

When contacted, the nazim claimed that the no confidence motion would suffer defeat as he enjoyed the support of the majority of councillors. Adil Islam had survived four similar attempts in the last four years.

",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: Official representation from the government of Sindh was absent at the first meeting of the National Curriculum Council (NCC) on Wednesday, held to develop a consensus on introducing a uniform system of education in the country.

Neither the Sindh education minister nor the education secretary attended the meeting, and sources in the PPP have said the move to convene the NCC meeting is unconstitutional.

A senior PPP leader told Dawn education and the curriculum already stand devolved to the provinces under the 18th Amendment. Sans representation from Sindh, participants of the NCC agreed in principle to bring uniformity to the education sector.

Participants of the curriculum council agree to bring uniformity to the education sector

The meeting was organised by the Ministry of Federal Education and attended by stakeholders from the public, private and madressah systems, the higher education sector and the provinces.

Education Minister Shafqat Mehmood, who chaired the meeting, said that the literacy rate has fallen in the last few years from 60 to 58.

In addition, more than22million children in Pakistan are out of school. He deplored that the country had so far failed to provide quality education and a uniform curriculum to students.

Mr Qureshi said the government wants to introduce a single national certification model in education.

Little attended was given to uplifting the public sector education system, Punjab Minister for Schools Education Murad Raas said, resulting in the growth of the private sector.

He said his ministry was taking steps to bring positive change.

The president of the Tanzeemul Madaris Pakistan, Mufti Muneebur Rehman, said seminaries are ready to cooperate with the government but there should be practical measures to achieve a uniform education system, as previous governments including the PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have failed in this regard.

Beaconhouse School System Executive Director Nasir Kasuri said the government should focus on quality and creativity in the education system.

Social activist and musician Shehzad Roy also expressed support for the government’s plan and said teacher training is particularly needed.

",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: A PTI senator criticised red-tapism and the federal government during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on National Health Services (NHS) on Wednesday.

Senator Dr Mehr Taj Roghani said it was unfortunate that bureaucrats “deliberately delay files and start their postmortem, due to which not only are projects delayed but all the concerned stakeholders suffer”.

During its meeting at Parliament House, the committee expressed displeasure with the submission of a Ministry of NHS report that was delayed by almost a month.

NHS Minister Aamer Mehmood Kiani had promised to submit the report, which concerned the educational qualifications of doctors working in government hospitals and details of the suspension of two doctors from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, in just three days.

Senator Roghani said that in her last tenure in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, she had asked PTI Chairman Imran Khan to fast-track files.

“My request was considered by the party, and after that it became routine for files to be approved within days. Currently, there is a perfect system in the province of KP due to which all the projects are expedited,” she said.

PML-N Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq asked why, if red-tapism had ended in KP, it had not ended in the federal government.

“Now the PTI is in power for the last five months at the federal level, but that system could not be introduced here,” she said.

Two doctors from Pims were suspended in September 2018 over allegations that they had hired a fake doctor while they were both absent at night duty.

The meeting also saw one senator walk out after the committee chair, Senator Mian Ateeq Shaikh from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, asked Pims Executive Director Dr Raja Amjad Mehmood why he was at the meeting.

He told Dr Amjad that according to his information, he had not been invited by the committee.

“I have given an observation that officers should not attend meetings unnecessarily because work suffers due to that practice. It is not acceptable that four secretaries would attend the meeting of the standing committee along with the minister. You should not have come here uninvited,” he added.

The criticism upset Senator Dilawar Khan, an independent, who said the chair had no right to humiliate anyone.

“You did the same thing to the governor State Bank of Pakistan the other day during a meeting of the standing committee on finance. I have no option but to boycott the meeting against your attitude,” he said.

Although Senator Shaikh apologised to Dr Amjad, Senator Dilawar left the room. He was later persuaded to return by senators Liaquat Khan Tarakai and Dr Ashok Kumar.

Dr Amjad tried to defuse the situation at the end of the meeting, remarking that Senator Shaikh was a classmate of his and had every right to speak to him in that tone.

",2019-01-10,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the provincial government, police chief and others on a petition challenging Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying Ordinance 2001.

A citizen, Ayza Javed, moved the petition as public interest litigation seeking a direction to the government functionaries not to allow kite flying or Basant festival.

The petitioner through counsel Sheraz Zaka contended that the impugned ordinance authorised the government to allow kite flying. He argued the kite-flying activity was an infringement of fundamental rights of the citizens.

He pointed out that the Supreme Court in its 2006 judgment declared kite flying and celebration of Basant festival a violation of fundamental rights. He said the provincial government in 2009 introduced an amendment to the law acquiring power to allow kite-flying activity without defining any criteria.

The counsel argued the fundamental rights were most superior and special in nature and could not be disturbed without having strict recourse to the law. He said the celebration of kite-flying festival would not only result in loss of lives but also disruption to electricity transmission.

He asked the court to direct the respondents not to allow any kite-flying activity nor celebration of Basant festival. He also urged the court to declare void section 4(1) and 4-B of the Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying Ordinance 2001, under which the government enjoyed powers to grant permission of kite flying.

The chief secretary, inspector general of police, lord mayor and Lesco had been made party in the petition.

Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh issued notices to respondents for Jan 15 and directed the registrar office to consolidate the petition with identical petitions already taken up by Justice Aminuddin Khan.

REMAND: An accountability court granted the NAB a 14-day physical remand of Gujrat’s former district police officer (DPO) Kamran Mumtaz facing charges of embezzlement in public funds.

The NAB arrested Mr Mumtaz the other day on his return from Australia after attending a professional training course. The bureau alleged the former DPO was involved in misappropriating Rs550m under different heads, including petrol bills, allowances and Shuhadaa funds of the department during his posting in Gujrat.

A NAB prosecutor asked the court to grant 15-day physical remand of the suspect for interrogation and recovery of the plundered money. However, the court allowed 14-day remand of the officer. In this case, another former DPO Rai Ijaz is already in the NAB custody.

",2019-01-10,"LAHORE: A 14-year-old boy was electrocuted while catching a stray kite in Misri Shah area here on Wednesday.

Police said that the deceased identified as Sohaib, son of Javed, was a seminary student.

He was playing in the street when he tried to catch a stray kite to which metallic string was attached.

As soon as the metallic string fell on a high-tension electric wire, Sohaib suffered severe electric shock, resulting in multiple burns to his body.

The locals immediately rushed him to hospital where doctors declared him dead, the police said.

Following his death, scores of relatives and other locals gathered near his house, raised slogans against the police and the Punjab government for their “failure” to check kite-flying.

They also blocked a road and lodged protest demanding, action against the police authorities and the government officials concerned who, they said, were responsible for the death.

",2019-01-10,"MITHI: Head of Senate’s stand­ing committee on problems of less developed areas, Mohammad Usman Kakar, has lamented dis­mal performance of both Sindh and federal governments in Thar desert where hundreds of infants have died from complications cau­s­ed by malnutrition and seaso­nal infections.

Mr Kakar, accompanied by Haji Momin Khan Afridi, Mohammad Shafeeq Tareen, Gayanchand and others who reached here on Wed­nes­day to assess drought condi­tions, told media persons after mee­ting officials and local Pakis­tan Peoples Party lawmakers that children were dying of hunger and the jobless were committing sui­cide but rulers kept harping on the same tune that Thar would change Pakistan.

He termed it a cruel joke with Tharis and said that federal government had not bothered to spend even a single penny either on relief packages or on any development scheme in the desert region over the past many years.

He urged the federal govern­ment and its ministries to play their role to save lives of Tharis by launching projects for training Thari youngs­ters in various skills so that they could raise standard of their lives.

The Sindh government, too, should focus on real issues of the drought-stricken people instead of doling out alms without launching long-term projects and said that governments were carrying out huge uplift schemes in cities only instead of mitigating sufferings of people living in backward areas.

He said that if only one per cent of royalty of Thar coal reserves were spent on the desert the situ­ation would greatly improve over the coming years.

It was a cruel joke to say that Thar which was itself facing the worst power crisis with only 200 out of 2,600 villages electrified so far was going to pro­vide power to the entire country.

He criticised the Sindh govern­ment for its failure to provide water and healthcare facilities to Thar and said that it was a matter of great concern that desert people were forced to drink highly contaminated water.

Senator Kakar demanded that a huge amount of Rs4 billion, which had been “squandered away” by Dr Samar Mubarkmand on under­ground coal gasification plant near Islamkot, be recovered from him and spent on development projects in Thar as the massive project was just a means to embezzle public money.

He cautioned against making any move to tinker with the Consti­tution to roll back certain clauses of 18th Amendment and said that such attempts would be foiled. All the democratic forces would ens­ure that more powers were dev­o­lved to provinces to strengthen the federation.

The country faced uncertainty because of one-sided accountabi­lity, he said, adding that all the per­sons who had committed corruption should be sent to jail but they must have the right to due process.

The National Finance Commis­sion Award should be calculated on the basis of level of poverty and backwardness instead of size of population.

PPP MNA Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani, government officials and PPP leaders briefed members of the Senate committee and claimed that Sindh government had launched mega projects to provide health and safe drinking water facilities in Thar.

The senators visited different areas including Thar coalfield and were briefed by officials of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company about coal extraction and power plants.

On Tuesday, the committee had arrived in Badin where Mr Kakar addressed a news conference at deputy commissioner’s office and deplored that flawed, self-centred and myopic policies of successive rulers had pushed backward areas into darkness.

He said that people would resist the move to construct controversial dam which had already been rejected by assemblies a number of times. Instead of creating hype over construction of more dams the government needed to first focus on judicious distribution of the available irrigation water among federating units, he added.

It was a matter of great concern that oil and gas companies were not ready to spend anything on the development of backward areas like Badin despite earning billions of rupees from extraction of petrochemicals, he said.

He said that most lawmakers deemed it below their dignity to raise chronic issues of their areas in assemblies and complained that during their visit to Badin no local lawmaker bothered to meet them and brief them about the issues of the district.

He said the committee would compile a report on burning issues of backward areas and submit it to upper house for debate.

Badin DC Dr Abdul Hafeez Siyal briefed the senators about the issues of the district.

",2019-01-10,"KARACHI: The Pakis­tan Medical Association (PMA) on Wednesday said it would not accept the “undemocratic” ordinance promulgated by the president of Pakistan allowing the prime minister, chief ministers, and armed forces to nominate their members to run the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), the premier body that regulated medical affairs in the country.

“It is entirely undemocratic, unconstitutional and would not be accepted by the entire medical fraternity,” said Dr S.M. Qaisar Sajjad at a press conference at the PMA House.

He said despite a promise recently made by the health minister to the PMA for running the PMDC democratically, President Arif Alvi had signed an ordinance through which a 17-member PMDC body would be formed through nominations by the PM, CMs, CPSP (College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan) and the armed forces.

PMDC regulates health bodies, medical educational institutions and bodies and was being run on ad-hoc basis for the past 11 months after the apex court dissolved and replaced it with a nine-member council headed by a former SC judge.

Accompanied by PMA president Dr Ikram Tunio, treasurer Dr Qazi Wasiq, PMA Karachi president Dr Khalil Mukaddam, and other officials, Dr Sajjad said the fraternity was deeply upset and concerned about yet another nominated PMDC, which was against the basic principles of democracy and laws of the country.

“We demand the government to immediately repeal the ordinance,” adding that the government should hold elections and run it as an independent regulatory body.

The PMA official said they had summoned the central council’s meeting in Islamabad next week where the issue would be discussed.

“We warn the government to act wisely; otherwise it should forget all other issues and prepare itself to deal with doctors only, who would make functioning of the government extremely hard.”

He said the PMDC was a doctors’ body and all its expenses were borne by doctors.

“It is a regulatory body to keep an eye over performance of doctors and medical education in the country and the doctors’ fraternity wants it to be an elected institution that functions democratically.”

He added people with vested interests could be behind such a move to gain monetary benefits by installing people of their choice in the PMDC through nominations.

“Our surgeons have performed paediatric and adult surgeries in four cities of Sindh — Karachi, Sukkur, Larkana and Tando Mohammad Khan in a single calendar year,” said Dr Nadeem Qamar, executive director, NICVD.

Besides, he added, over 12,000 procedures, dozens of cardiac implants had been carried out and thousands of diagnostic procedures were conducted last year.

“All this is done totally free at our hospital in Karachi and eight satellites being run across Sindh.”

He said the NICVD emerged as one of the largest centres in the world in performing primary PCI or angioplasty after heart attack and elective angioplasties in a single year, adding that cardiologists performed 8,197 primary PCIs at all NICVD facilities after patients were brought to the hospital without heart attacks and required immediate treatment because of obstruction in arteries.

He said the NICVD had established its satellites in Hyderabad, Nawabshah, Sehwan, Tando Mohammad Khan, Mithi, Larkana, Khairpur and Sukkur.

He said NICVD Karachi received 1.123 million cardiac patients, of which 3,847 required surgeries.

Seven chest pain units are operating in Karachi under Gulshan Chowrangi Flyover, Gulbai Flyover, Qayyumabad Flyover, Malir Halt Flyover, Nagan Chowrangi Flyover, at I.I. Chundrigar Road and at Lyari General Hospital.

",2019-01-10,"KARACHI: While not ruling out extremism as a motive, the police authorities on Wednesday hinted at narrowing down the scope of investigation into last month’s murder of Ali Raza Abidi, former MNA and leader of a faction of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, when they claimed to have found leads suggesting that the party’s London- and South Africa-based members were in the city to execute the job.

Talking to reporters after seeing former Sindh Governor Mohammad Zubair at his residence in Defence Housing Authority, SSP South Pir Mohammed Shah said that the probe into Mr Abidi’s killing had made some headway and the investigators were close to knowing the motive and people behind his assassination.

“We are gradually moving forward in that [Abidi’s killing] case,” he said. “We are excluding people and groups who cannot be suspected of their involvement in the incident. But definitely there are credible reports that people of the London group, or you can say the South African group, are here in the city. Every government agency is doing its job and adding its inputs. Considering the history of violence in Karachi, we cannot rule out extremism and terrorism as a possible motive, but there are other actors as well who are taken into account.”

",2019-01-10,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday issued notices to provincial police officer, director general of Rangers and others on a petition seeking whereabouts of a missing person.

The petitioner, Abdul Hannan, through his lawyer moved the SHC and contended that his brother Abdul Raheem was allegedly picked up from his house in a Korangi locality on the night of Dec 20 by personnel of law enforcement agencies.

Thereafter, the lawyer argued that the petitioner approached the SHO of the Korangi Industrial Area police station and other authorities concerned to know whereabouts of the detainee, but to no avail.

Impleading the home secretary, DG Rangers, IG Sindh, DIG CTD and others as respondents, the petitioner pleaded for whereabouts of his brother and also sought directive for respondents to produce the detainee before the court.

After the preliminary hearing, a two-judge bench of the SHC headed by Justice Khadim Hussain Tunio issued notices to the respondents with direction to file comments.

Suspect remanded in murder case

The administrative judge of antiterrorism courts on Wednesday remanded a suspect in custody of the Counter-Terrorism Department in a case pertaining to murder of two seminary teachers.

The CTD produced Abbas, alias Chotoo, before the court and contended that he was allegedly involved in the murder of two seminary teachers Mufti Kamran and Mufti Ghulam Akbar, who were gunned down inside a seminary in Gulshan-i-Iqbal Block 6 in August 2016.

The investigating officer further submitted that four accused had already been arrested and were facing trial in the double murder case before an ATC and sought custody of newly-arrested suspect for questioning. The administrative judge handed over the suspect to CTD on five-day physical remand.

The prosecution said that the CTD had arrested Syed Amir Husain Rizvi, Zainul Abideen, Faiziyab Ali and Syed Mohsin in September 2016 for their alleged involvement in the present case as well as some other cases.

",2019-01-10,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Wednesday dismissed an application seeking to halt the proceedings of Perween Rahman’s murder trial until an order was passed by the Supreme Court on her sister’s plea for re-investigation of the case by the Federal Investigation Agency.

Earlier, the same court had dismissed an application moved by the slain activist’s sister pleading to summon and record testimonies of the members of a Supreme Court-appointed joint investigation team (JIT), which had detained and grilled some of the accused involved in the murder.

Five detained accused — Abdul Raheem Swati, his son Mohammad Imran Swati, Ayaz Shamzai alias Swati, Amjad Hussain Khan and Ahmed Khan alias Ahmed Ali alias Pappu Kashmiri — have been charged with the murder.

ATC rules indefinite adjournment of a criminal case is against normal trend of jurisprudence

Ms Rahman, head of the Orangi Pilot Project, was gunned down near her office in Orangi Town on March 13, 2013.

On Wednesday, the ATC-XIII conducting trial inside the judicial complex in the central prison pronounced its verdict reserved earlier after hearing arguments from the defence, prosecution and the counsel for the complainant.

The judge passed the order while disposing of an application jointly filed by Advocate Salahuddin Panhwar, who represented the complainant, and Assistant Prosecutor General Ghulam Murtaza Maitlo for the state under Section 344 (power to postpone or adjourn proceedings) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) read with Section 32 (overriding effect of the act) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.

After considering the arguments of the prosecutor and the counsel for the complainant and the accused, the judge wrote in his order that admittedly the matter pertained to 2013 and could not be finalised for one or the other reason.

The accused were behind bars since the date of their arrest and their bail applications had also been dismissed by the trial court as well as the high court, the court added.

It said there were directions of the Sindh High Court to conclude the matter within two months and the trial court had taken efforts and examined all the witnesses cited in the calendar of witnesses and side of the prosecution had been closed.

The judge noted that the statements of the accused under Section 342 (power to examine the accused) as well as 340(2) (right of person to be defended and his competency to be a witness) of the CrPC had been recorded.

He noted that the complainant’s counsel moved an application requesting to summon and record statements of the members of the JIT, but the application was dismissed.

Therefore, the complainant challenged the same order by filing a revision application before the SHC besides moving an application with the SC with a request to entrust investigation of the case to an honest and impartial officer of the FIA.

She also filed the present application with the trial court requesting it to indefinitely adjourn the matter or stay further proceedings in the case, arguing that if the present application was disposed of the other applications pending before the SHC and the SC would become infructuous.

Opposing the plea, Advocate Shah Imroze Khan, defence counsel for accused Imran Swati, contended that the plea was not maintainable for passing any order as the relief claimed by the complainant was not within the jurisdiction of the trial court.

“The case cannot be stayed or adjourned sine die without any restraining order by the superior courts,” the counsel said, adding that there were directives of the SHC to the trial court to conclude the matter within two months.

The trial was near its end and the complainant intended to make the matter linger on, on one or the other pretext, he said and pleaded to dismiss the application.

The judge ruled that there was no specific direction of the Supreme Court regarding staying the proceedings and observed: “The adjournment of a criminal case indefinitely is against the normal trend of criminal jurisprudence and it should generally be discouraged, as held in numerous cases by the superior courts that the policy of criminal law aims at bringing accused persons to justice as speedily as possible, so that if they are found guilty, they may be punished and if they are found innocent, they may be acquitted and discharged.”

The judge ruled that no reasonable ground was shown by the complainant’s counsel and in the light of circumstances, “I do not find any merit in the instant application and the same is hereby dismissed”.

Official sources told Dawn that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation — which had launched an anti-encroachment drive late last year following the orders of the Supreme Court against illegal structures on drains, pavements and state land — formed a four-member committee comprising two estate officers of the municipal administration and as many representatives of the book bazaar to resolve the matter.

The vendors and merchants staged a protest on Tuesday against the impending anti-encroachment action at Urdu Bazaar as the KMC had on Jan 4 given them notices to vacate the government property before Jan 8 midnight.

Officials said that following heated protests, led by the Urdu Bazaar Market Association and the Booksellers Association, the drive was postponed and a final decision in this regard was expected on Thursday (today).

They said that the four-member committee would submit a report clarifying that Urdu Bazaar was not located over a drain in the next two days.

According to the protesting vendors and merchants, the iconic bazaar was a cultural heritage of the city.

They said that the KMC claimed that their shops were illegal and asked them to clear out their shops.

The protesters said that the Urdu Bazaar was there for decades and it was set up through legal procedures and was not an encroachment.

However, the KMC officials said that shops were located over a drain.

The Urdu Bazaar Market Association said that almost all bookshop owners had legal documents of ownership. It said the owners had paid the rent of the shops till December 2018.

The shopkeepers have been regularly paying the rent to the KMC after the interval of six months.

WWF award to KMC

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) awarded Karachi with WWF’s One Planet City Challenge Award for 2018 as a recognition of measures taken by Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar for bringing environmental pollution to a lower level.

The award signed by the secretary general of WWF Sweden, Hakan Writen, was handed over to the mayor by a delegation of WWF at his office.

The delegation informed that the WWF’s One Planet City Challenge award is given to management of big cities for their endeavour to control environmental pollution.

It said that Karachi was aiming high with its goal for 2020 — to cut carbon emissions by 40 per cent compared to 2017 levels and the city emerged as the strongest candidate in Pakistan for the award.

Meanwhile, in a meeting chaired by the mayor, chairmen/chairpersons of nine committees of the City Council were elected.

",2019-01-10,"RAWALPINDI: Adviser to Prime Minister on Commerce, Investment and Textile, Abdul Razak Dawood on Wednesday said business community has been the top priority of government and the focus was to strengthen the interaction with traders.

The minister was talking to a delegation of Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry led by its President Malik Shahid Saleem,.

Mr Dawood said that government was working on a multilateral policy including reforms in taxation, regulatory duty and ease of doing business.

“We are working on framing a new industrial policy which will bridge the fundamental disconnects between government and the private sector,” he said, adding “We want recommendations and suggestions to improve our ailing industry, especially small and medium enterprises.”

On the occassion, Mr Saleem said the government should act proactively and set a clear direction for economy with short, medium and long-term goals.

Deindustrialisation situation is an alarming challenge for the country, which has led to a decrease in revenues and increased the number of unemployed people, he added.

290,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456637/sc-asks-three-depts-to-find-lands-of-bahria-town,"SC asks three depts to find lands of Bahria Town
",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court ordered three top government institutions to ascertain the actual lands in physical possession of the Bahria Town (Pvt) Ltd, Malir, which according to the National Accoun­tability Bureau (NAB) is 25,601 acres.

A three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed, ordered the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), the Survey of Pakistan and NAB to sit together and identify lands which Bahria Town claims is not in their possession and have erroneously been added to Bahria Town by NAB.

The bench had taken up the implementation of the May 4 judgement of the Supreme Court.

Suparco, Survey of Pakistan and NAB told to sit together and identify lands which the firm claims have been added in its name erroneously

The judgement concerns with cases involving the grant of 9,385 acres of land in 43 Dehs, consolidated by the Malir Development Authority (MDA) and then handed over to the Bahria Town in 2015. The land is situated about nine kilometres from the toll plaza on the Karachi-Hyderabad Superhighway, a 25-minute drive from the Jinnah International Airport.

In its May 4 judgement, the Supreme Court had held that the grant of land to the MDA by the Sindh government, its exchange with the land of the private land developers — Messrs Bahria Town — and anything done under the provisions of Colonisation of Government Land Act, 1912, (COGLA) by the Sindh government as illegal, void ab initio and as such of no legal existence.

The lands were granted for launching incremental housing scheme, but instead of launching it, the MDA exchanged it with the Bahria Town to launch a scheme of its own, the judgement had held.

The MDA was created by the Malir Development Authority Act, 1993, for the purpose of developing certain areas of the Karachi division.

The directions came when Barrister Ali Zafar, who represented the Bahria Town, disputed the claim of NAB and asserted that figures being cited by NAB were wrong since NAB had included 1,664 acres of lands of the adjoining Jamshoro district which were private-owned properties besides the bureau had added another 10,000 acres with the Bahria Town.

He said that 7,318 acres was government land which could be taken out and according to Bahria Town’s calculation the total lands the builder tycoon owned was 16,200 acres and not 18,336 acres as was claimed earlier.

NAB’s Investigating Officer Qamar Abbass told the Supreme Court that as per the determination of the Survey of Pakistan, the actual lands in possession of Bahria Town was 25,601 acres out of which 7,220 acres were illegally exchanged in Feb 2015 with MDA by Mr Malik Riaz.

In 2016, the actual lands in possession of the Bahria Town were 12,156 which swelled to 25,601 acres, the NAB investigation officer told the Supreme Court.

NAB Prosecutor General Syed Asghar Haider informed the court that NAB had completed its investigation into the Malir development case and the reference in this regard was being vetted, but the formal reference would be finalised in two to three weeks.

The investigation officer said that 1,644 acres which Bahria Town claimed to be situated in the Jamshoro district was also Sindh government’s lands, adding that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board had also informed NAB that the private builder had carried out 59 unauthorised borings of which 1.7 million of gallons of water was being extracted from aquifer on a daily basis.

In addition to this Rs5.5 billion was still outstanding with the MDA which the builder had to pay for the layout plans.

The Sindh Building Control Authority is also claiming that all buildings had been constructed illegally in Malir district by the Bahria Town, the investigation officer said, adding that no taxes for the registration of lands had been paid to the Sindh government by Bahria Town.

Justice Saeed, however, asked NAB to investigate and file separate references against the builder, adding that rights of the Sindh government would be protected at all cost. The judge observed that the court expected that an appropriate action would be taken against the departments concerned and the builder.

291,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456638/pakistan-saudi-arabia-may-ink-10bn-mous-this-month,"Pakistan, Saudi Arabia may ink $10bn MoUs this month
",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are likely to sign memoranda of understanding for more than $10 billion Saudi investment in Pakistan this month. Pakistan will also sign similar MoUs with China, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia over the next two months.

This was said in the second meeting on ease of doing business (EoDB) presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday. The meeting was told that the MoU on investment framework with the UAE was expected next month.

Talking to Dawn after the meeting, Finance Minister Asad Umar said Saudi Prince Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz would visit Pakistan next month and most of the MoUs were expected to be signed during his trip.

PM briefed about similar agreements that will be signed with China, UAE and Malaysia in next two months

When contacted, Board of Investment (BoI) Chairman Haroon Sharif said Saudi Arabia was interested in Pakistan’s four sectors — oil refinery, petrochemicals, renewable energy and mining. “We are expecting $10bn plus Saudi investment and the MoUs to be signed in this regard will not be common or vague but concrete agreements,” he added.

The $10bn investment will be in addition to the $6bn bailout package given by Riyadh to Islamabad during Prime Minister Khan’s visit to Saudi Arabia in October last year. “According to a survey, 65 per cent of the investments will take place in the country’s commercial hub Karachi and 35pc in Lahore. Therefore, better law and order situation and ease-of-doing-business opportunities were prerequisite for foreign investment,” the BoI chairman added.

He said the government had made it mandatory for all foreign firms to invest in joint ventures with Pakistani firms so that local companies could also get boost and deal with local issues in a better way.

He said Saudi firm Aramco would invest in an oil refinery and was likely to set up its own refinery in Pakistan. “Saudi Arabia is also interested in petrochemicals and will make investment in this sector as well,” he added.

Mr Sharif said there was a big room for renewable energy in Sindh, Balochistan and central Punjab and, therefore, Saudi firm Aqua Power, which controls renewable energy business in Tunisia, the UAE and Jordon, had a comprehensive plan on renewable energy projects in Pakistan.

He said he had recently visited China and signed MoUs on industrial cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CEPC). “Now we have to build economic zones along the corridor.”

The BoI chief said the UAE was interested in agriculture, housing and other sectors. He added that four Malaysian firms were also due this month and would invest in four sectors — halal meat, gemstone, information technology and hi-tech education.

An official press release issued by the Prime Minister Office said: “Briefing the meeting about various positive developments with regards to investment facilitation, it was informed that an MoU on industrial cooperation has been signed with China last month. The MoU with Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is expected to be signed this month whereas investment framework MoU with the UAE is expected in February 2019.”

The meeting was attended by the finance minister, Adviser to the PM on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, PM’s adviser Dr Ishrat Hussain and the BoI chairman.

The BoI chairman briefed the prime minister about the progress on various indicators related to ease of doing business.

The meeting was informed that the number of taxes had been brought down from 47 to 21. “We have clubbed together many taxes to facilitate the business community,” Mr Sharif added.

He said a new system of value added tax refund would be in place by March 31 which would significantly reduce time in obtaining the VAT refund, adding that efforts were also being made to improve the risk-management system to reduce the number of physical audits.

About the ease of starting business, the prime minister was informed that integration of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan with provincial portals and Employees Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) had been completed in Punjab and efforts were being made to expedite launch of such portal in Sindh.

The meeting was informed that significant progress had been made to facilitate provision of electricity and timely information to the businesses. Besides availability of required documents on website, a full online application system is being rolled out and advance notifications are being ensured about change in tariff, etc.

In the area of getting credit, the meeting was informed that registrar would be appointed by the end of this month and rules under the Secured Transaction Act were being finalised by the Ministry of Finance.

The prime minister emphasised the need for greater focus on addressing issues relating to ease of doing business in Sindh since Karachi was financial hub of the country.

It was decided that regular meetings on EoDB would be chaired by the prime minister with participation of the chief ministers and chief secretaries. It was also decided that dedicated EoDB offices would be set up at federal and provincial levels for the purpose of removing bottlenecks and facilitating investors for smooth business operations.

“Your policies lack consistency, keeping investors from China and elsewhere at bay,” he responded when the business community asked why Chinese companies, after relocating their businesses from the United States, were preferring investment in other countries, including Cambodia and India, instead of Pakistan that was already executing several projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

Yao says while PML-N govt paid full attention to Gwadar port, infrastructure and energy projects, it neglected completion of special economic zones

The ambassador said that under the CPEC, projects relating to the Gwadar port, infrastructure, energy and special economic zones (SEZs) were to be completed.

“Though the outgoing PML-N government paid full attention to the Gwadar port, infrastructure and energy projects, it neglected completion of the SEZs. Since there are no SEZs too, how Chinese investors can make investments,” he said.

Under the CPEC, Mr Yao said, the SEZs should be given priority because they would boost joint ventures, specifically in manufacturing and socio-economic sectors of the country.

“In SEZs and joint venture schemes, 70-80 per cent priority would be given to Pakistan shares and exports of Pakistan would increase by 70-80pc,” he maintained. He also revealed that the CPEC would soon be opened to the world for investment.

The Chinese envoy said Pakistan was required to make its trade policies better, besides bringing down ratio of taxes and duties and making its products competitive. “Improvement of competitiveness will help your country make trade balanced.”

He praised the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government for having export-oriented vision. “The new government has an export-oriented vision and looks determined to resolve various issues,” the ambassador said.

",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: The Fina­ncial Action Task Force (FATF) is reported to have expressed a degree of satisfaction over Pakistan’s efforts and action plan to combat money laundering and terror financing under international obligations and indicated certain areas to do more before May this year to get out of the grey list.

A high-level delegation led by Finance Secretary Arif Ahmed Khan is currently attending a three-day conference of the FATF in Sydney, Australia. The delegation comprises representatives of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), National Counter Terrorism Autho­rity (Nacta), Federal Inves­tigation Agency (FIA), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and Financial Monitoring Unit.

“For the first time, our delegation felt that FATF is appreciating our performance so far,” a senior official told Dawn on the basis of feedback received from Sydney on the conclusion of second day of the conference. He said most of the 10-point action plan envisaging 27 benchmarks had been reviewed by the Paris-based global watchdog on anti-money laundering and terror financing. One or two relatively insignificant areas were left for Thursday when the FATF will give its final opinion.

The official said the FATF had highlighted a few matters that were doable by May but progress would need to be registered by February. He said the next review meeting of the FATF would be held in Paris in February to be followed by a broader examination of the full compliance with international commitments at another meeting in May – possibly in Sri Lanka or Sydney. The May meeting would determine whether or not Pakistan is on the course to exit from the grey list by September.

Officials said the FATF had gone through the report dispatched by Pakistan last week before the review meetings with the Pakistani delegation involving questions and answers on the performance so far and the way forward. They said the FATF team appeared convinced over the steps and measures taken by the authorities to combat terror financing and money laundering in line with the United Nations resolutions.

The Pakistani delegation explained the implementation status of the plans for various government agencies. The report identifies Pak-Afghan and Pak-Iran borders as key routes for terror financing and money laundering and says 4,643 suspected transactions relating to terror financing and money laundering have been identified and blocked since 2015, including 3,677 suspected transaction reports and 966 financial intelligence reports. A total of 1,167 transactions have been captured during 2018 alone, including 975 suspected transaction reports and 210 financial intelligence reports.

To address the challenge at the two borders, the report says, checking and security systems at Pak-Afghan border have been strengthened with improved technology and vigilance while security has also been beefed up at Pak-Iran border.

The report says the long coastal belt is also a source of smuggling and security is being tightened through law enforcement agencies, including through marine and coast guards. It says Afghan transit trade is also a source of such unregistered financial flows. All these channels are also being misused by foreign agencies to support terror-related activities.

The tools being used for financial transaction for terrorism include donations, cash smuggling, natural resources, drugs, non-governmental organisations and foreign agencies, the report says. The FBR identified about 1,185 illegal transactions since 2015, followed by 1,049 by the SBP and about 1,295 by the FIA.

During the May and September meetings, regulators and law enforcement agencies will be expected to demonstrate results in the form of investigations, prosecutions, convictions, supervisory actions, sanctions with resulting impacts on compliance by financial institutions, implementation of cross-border currency and border controls and enforcement of regulatory regime at the borders. Nacta will be expected to enhance coordination with law enforcement agencies and the Counter Terrorism Department coupled with effective implementation of sanctions under the United Nations Security Council resolutions.

In June 2018, Pakistan made a high-level political commitment to work with the FATF and APG (Asia Pacific Group on money laundering) to strengthen its anti-money laundering /counter-terror financing regime and to address its strategic counter-terrorism financing-related deficiencies by implementing a 10-point action plan to accomplish these objectives.

The successful implementation of the action plan and its physical verification by the APG will lead the FATF to clear Pakistan out of its grey list or else move into the black list by Sept.

In August, the APG as part of the pre-site mutual evaluation identified a series of deficiencies in Pakistan’s anti-money laundering/counter-terror financing laws and mechanisms.

The authorities are required to upgrade agencies and their human resources to enable them to handle foreign requests to block terror financing and freeze illegal and targeted assets. By the end of September, Pakistan has to comply with the action plan it has committed with the FATF in June to get out of the grey list or else fall into the black list.

Over the next nine months, i.e. till September, the government will complete the investigation into the widest range of terror financing activities, including appeals and calls for donations and collection of funds, besides their movements and uses.

",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday ordered the removal of managing directors of the Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) and the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) over the gas crisis that gripped Punjab and Sindh last month.

The “prime minister has announced immediate removal of heads of Sui Southern and Sui Northern from their posts” in view of a report of an inquiry committee, Information Minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said in a statement.

The committee had been constituted by the prime minister to fix responsibility for problems faced by the consumers due to gas shortage in recent days. The committee submitted its report to the PM on Tuesday.

Imran Khan takes decision in the light of inquiry into recent gas shortages

Following his orders, the petroleum division asked the boards of directors of the two companies to immediately hold meetings on Thursday to implement the prime minister’s orders as required under the corporate governance rules for the public sector entities.

Informed sources said the top-most officials of the petroleum division bid farewell to SNGPL managing director Amjad Latif at the federal secretariat where he attended a board meeting and expressed their sympathy with him over a sudden decision of the prime minister though the gas import and allocation policies rested with the federal government.

The information minister’s statement has attributed the prime minister’s decision to the review of the report submitted by the committee tasked with probing the ongoing gas supply crisis, which has rapidly escalated across the country over the past few months.

On Dec 12, 2018, the prime minister had ordered an inquiry into the dwindling supply of gas which forced industry closures in Punjab and Karachi and affected residential and commercial consumers. The petroleum division had blamed the two companies for concealment of related information from the government.

Interestingly, the petroleum division subsequently told the prime minister that shortfall was also contributed by two additional factors — gas allocations to fertiliser and export industry for the first time in winter followed by closure of a liquefied natural gas terminal for maintenance.

In these matters, the decision-making and planning lie with federal ministries and forums and the SNGPL and the SSGCL have no role in it.

The petroleum minister had reported that a drop in gas production in the southern fields of Kunnar Pasakhi and Gambat caused problems in Karachi, and faults in gas compressors at Nawabshah and Saran created shortages in the north. “SNGPL did not report gas demand and supply shortfall in December accurately to the government, and SSGCL failed to inform the government about faults in the compressors in a timely manner,” he said.

Data of the gas flows is on display on a round the clock basis in the petroleum division, showing real time situation of gas intake from various sources and outflow to various customers.

The petroleum division has said the specific allegations against the managing directors of the SNGPL and the SSGCL include negligence in reporting of facts to the ministry or incompetence to deal with operational issues, withholding of information from the government and overall systematic failure of the two companies.

An earlier fact-finding committee headed by Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority chairperson Uzma Adil Khan had not blamed the two companies or their heads for the shortage in its report.

A subsequent report prepared by the additional secretary in-charge had also left the conclusion open-ended, leaving the decision to the prime minister, the information minister had said on Tuesday.

",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan Peoples Party leader and former chairman of the Senate, Mian Raza Rabbani, says the government appears to be moving towards centralisation and wants to roll back or circumvent provincial autonomy to create a presidential form of government.

Talking to media on Wednesday, he said it was the duty of parliament and judiciary, as per the 1973 Constitution, to prevent the federal executive from encroaching upon the domain of the provinces.

“The federal government continues to circumvent constitutional provisions in reference to provincial autonomy granted by the 18th Constitutional Amendment,” he said. The decision of the Cabinet Committee on Energy to reduce the life of solar and wind projects generating electricity to 15 years from 20 years was unconstitutional, Mr Rabbani added.

“The subject of electricity is Entry No 14, Part II of the Federal Legislative List of the Constitution and thus falls within the purview of the Council of Common Interests (CCI). Any policy decision by the Cabinet Committee on Energy for electricity is a clear transgression and infringement into the domain of the CCI,” he noted.

The province of Sindh, he said, was being denied its constitutional share of natural gas in violation of Article 158 of the Constitution, as a consequence of which industries were closing down and labour facing retrenchment.

Article 158 of the Constitution reads: “The Province in which a well-head of natural gas is situated shall have precedence over other parts of Pakistan in meeting the requirements from that well-head, subject to the commitments and obligations as on the commencing day”. Mr Rabbani termed the two decisions taken by the federal government an attempt to economically destabilise Sindh.

“Former federal minister and president National Party Mir Hasil Khan Bizenjo called on former president of Pakistan and president PPPP Asif Ali Zardari and Chairman PPP Bilawal Bhutto Zardari at Bilawal House and discussed a host of issues of mutual interest. Deputy Chairman Senate Salim Mandviwala was also present,” said the statement.

When contacted, Senator Bizenjo avoided going into details of the discussion, but admitted ‘his wish’ for the alliance of the two major parties of the opposition due to severity of the political challenges. He replied in the affirmative when asked about his expected meeting with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leadership on the same agenda with the consent of the PPP leaders for a united stance of the opposition parties over the key issues.

Zardari, Bilawal and Mandviwala agree for a united stand on some key issues

“There are several such issues which are a source of concern for all democratic parties which believe in parliamentary rule and norms,” he said. “Among them, for instance, are the 18th Amendment and NFC award. I personally wish and want them [PPP and PML-N] to unite on such issues. Meeting with Mr Zardari was really good and I would definitely take this up with the PML-N leaders as well and hope to receive their positive response.”

The sources said that the meeting which lasted almost an hour also discussed various options the opposition parties may adopt on key issues that included the 18th Amendment, ‘feared one-party rule’ and recent charged mood of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf against the PPP’s government in Sindh.

They said the discussion focused thoughts from both sides over the possibility of the “alliance between the PPP and PML-N as key opposition parties” for meeting the approaching political challenges.

",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) on Wednesday approved the payment of Rs4.058 billion to clear salaries and related dues of 12,175 teachers of Basic Education Community Schools providing non-formal basic education to the downtrodden.

The meeting, presided over by Finance Minister Asad Umar, had a detailed discussion on matters pertaining to the project regarding operation of these schools and allowed Rs4.058bn, clearing the previous liabilities and six months’ expenses of the current financial year up to December 2018.

This will be subject to verification of personnel and facilities by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) and the district administration concerned.

The project is based on non-formal basic education system where the community provides for the premises, while expenses on teachers’ honorarium, utility bills, text books, etc, are met by the federal government.

12,175 people to benefit from Ecnec decision

The enrolment in these schools was about 463,198 and 56 per cent of the students were female, with each school having roughly 30 students of age group 4-16 years. Single teacher is responsible for all the classes of the school by adopting multi-grade teaching methods based on formal school curriculum.

The project, originally planned for five years, is under implementation since 1995 in areas where formal schools were not available and cover all the provinces and areas of the country on the basis of need determined by physical survey of the identified location.

The project was started with an initial cost of Rs1.26bn in 1995 for five years. Ecnec again approved the project in 2007 at a revised cost of Rs7bn with implementation period from 2006 to 2010. It was once against approved in 2014 at a cost of Rs4.28bn for 2013-16. Another phase was approved in July 2017 at another revised cost of Rs3bn.

The sponsoring agency — Ministry of Education and Professional Training — has now come up with six-month salary and liabilities as a new project.

About Rs1.2bn has already been allocated in the current year’s Public Sector Development Programme. The Planning Commission has, however, objected to the project on the grounds that it should now be adopted by the provinces for which a case should be immediately taken up at the level of Council of Common Interests.

The Planning Commission has also demanded that besides Nadra and district administration’s verification for the future, the education and professional training ministry should also submit a forensic audit report conducted by the Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue from original commencement of the revised project in 2007.

The meeting was told that most of the funds required would go against the payment of salaries to the teachers until December 2018, besides about Rs477 million other liabilities.

",2019-01-10,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) hearing a complaint against a judge of the Lahore High Court on Wednesday accepted a request from the judge’s defence counsel of giving up 37 defence witnesses in lieu of six, including former chief justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.

The witnesses who will now likely appear on behalf of LHC judge Justice Muhammad Farrukh Irfan Khan are Justice Chaudhry, Nisar Bhatti, Sanjeev Kumar Patel from the United Arab Emirates, Syed Mubashir Ali and Iseeb-ur-Rehman from London, in addition to the judge himself.

Headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, the five-judge SJC postponed further proceedings till Monday, when statements of all the witnesses would be recorded. Cross-examination of the witnesses would also be carried out.

Senior counsel Hamid Khan, who was representing Justice Khan, requested the council to order the government to facilitate the issuance of visas to the witnesses so that they could arrive in Pakistan on time.

The council, however, cautioned that in addition to the six witnesses no other witness would be allowed to record his/her statement.

The council again rejected the request to summon the former chief justice of Pakistan, but said that if Justice Chaudhry wanted to appear on his own, he could do so to testify to the evidence he had given in the shape of an affidavit.

Chief Justice Nisar observed that Justice Chaudhry should have known that the affidavit had no value unless the deponent was cross-examined.

In his affidavit, Justice Chaudhry defended Justice Khan by stating that he did not receive any complaint nor receive any adverse remarks or report from any member of the public, bar, judge of the high court or the chief justice of the Lahore High Court during his tenure as the chief justice of Pakistan and that the sitting judge was also not short-tempered or disrespectful to the members of the bar or litigants or to the government officials.

On the contrary, during his tenure as judge of the high court, Justice Khan conducted himself with the “highest dignity and judicial guise” and his elevation and working as a judge added to the respect and decorum of the institution.

Justice Khan, the affidavit contended, had always enjoyed a very good reputation amongst his brother judges, the bar and the litigants as an upright, honest, hardworking and dedicated judge.

Justice Chaudhry further said that he had nominated and elevated Justice Khan not only due to his vast legal and international experience, but also because he was an honest and upright citizen.

Moreover, Justice Khan was a successful lawyer both in Pakistan and at the international forums and was respected as a professional lawyer by all, Justice Chaudhry said, adding that Justice Khan had disclosed to him about his practice in the UAE, factum of owning properties and that he was working in the boards of different charitable organisations prior to his elevation.

300,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456474/satire-pakistan-voted-the-best-country-in-the-universe,"Satire: Pakistan voted the best country in the universe
",2019-01-10,"In a joint meeting between the government, the judiciary and the military, a vote was held to determine the best country in the universe. In an almost unanimous decision, Pakistan was voted as the best. Even though Pakistan was the only option on the ballot, certain PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) ministers still wrote ‘Go Nawaz Go’ on it and checked that box instead.

After the voting, Prime Minister Imran Khan asked for a re-election; members of the press present assumed it was simply out of habit but Khan insisted that the result should accurately encapsulate the sentiment of the people by stating that Naya Pakistan is the best country in the universe. Fawad Chaudhry managed to placate the premier by adding a proviso to the result clarifying that Pakistan became the best country in the universe after July 2018.

Imran Khan then congratulated himself for turning the worst country in the world to the best country in the universe in less than 100 days. Upon Imran Khan’s mention of the worst country, a note was passed to him and the prime minister frantically asked for a different vote. Five minutes later India was voted the worst country in the world in an almost unanimous decision. Somehow Fayaz ul Hasan Chohan and Murad Saeed still managed to vote for ‘Go Nawaz Go’ in this voting too.

Both domestic and foreign policy were discussed in the meeting. Shah Mehmood Qureshi took a well-deserved nap while muttering in his sleep, “Foreign policy will be made in the foreign office” followed by chuckles and hearty laughs.

The press was asked to highlight all the grand achievements of the nation and the giant strides it has made in the past five months. Shaikh Rasheed congratulated Imran Khan for ensuring that for the first time ever 2019 happened in Pakistan before any other country. Rasheed got fired up and remarked, “Imran Khan has managed to bring Pakistan further in time than any other politician ever.” However, he was sharply rebuked by the state and then reminded of 1947. Fayaz ul Hasan Chohan also criticised Shaikh Rasheed for not urging Pakistan to go back 1,400 years.

Pakistan was also declared to be the safest country in the world for foreigners. Pictures of white people with cameras were used to make the point. These people, who were totally not paid to come to Pakistan and did so of their own accord, were used as shining examples of Pakistan’s achievements in tourism. Imran Khan again congratulated himself for once again being able to bring white female tourists to Pakistan.

Imran said, “Pakistan is so safe, a white girl can now cycle on the streets of Peshawar.” A reporter then asked Khan, “what if the girl was Pakistani ...” but before he could finish his sentence Fayaz ul Hasan Chohan threw a glass of water on his face and accused him of being an infidel. The reporter was then dragged out of the meeting.

Imran Khan then voted himself in as the Herald’s person of the year.

The remaining journalists were then shown pictures of their family members and briefed on the routes their children took on their way to school. After the briefing, all the journalists congratulated the government on its remarkable achievements in promoting freedom of speech and protecting the rights of journalists. Asad Umar’s interview on Hard Talk was then played on repeat five times.

All the newspapers reported that the whole nation is happy and nobody cares about the dollar rate because nobody has any dollars. We do not need to import anymore cheese. Looking at the amount of intolerance in Pakistan, nobody would be surprised to find we were lactose intolerant too. And if we are not, we can simply declare lactose to be non-Muslim and become intolerant of it.

The meeting ended with the government condemning the United States for its support of terrorists, India for its treatment of Muslims, Israel for its military operations against Muslim Palestinians, Netherlands for its hate speech towards Muslims, and irony for existing.

",2019-01-09,"A special antiterrorism court in Lahore on Wednesday sentenced a cyberstalker to 24 years imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs0.7 million for blackmailing scores of women and extorting money from them, many of whom were lady doctors.

Abdul Wahab, a resident of Punjab's Layyah district, was arrested in 2015 from Naran after the scam surfaced that nearly 200 women, including lady doctors and nurses of some government teaching hospitals of Lahore, had been harassed or blackmailed by him. Subsequently, Gawal Mandi police station in Lahore registered a case against him.

It was later revealed that most of the victims were house officers and postgraduate trainees from King Edward Medical University, Fatima Jinnah Medical University and Children Hospital, Lahore.

The convict used to introduce himself as an official of the ""military intelligence"", said Dr Salman, on whose complaint the case was registered. Later, he was arrested on allegations of hacking the Whatsapp accounts of lady doctors, blackmailing them with ""objectionable video clips and photos"" and then extorting money from them.

During the trial, 31 witnesses recorded their statements as state counsel Abdul Rauf Wattoo presented arguments from the prosecution side.

The defendant's lawyer claimed that ""a false case had been registered against his client and pleaded before the court to issue orders for his acquittal"".

After listening to final arguments from both sides, Judge Sajjad Ahmad sentenced the man to a total of 24 years in prison along with a fine of Rs0.7 million.

The charges against him, according to the order sheet, are as under:

Convicted under Section 7(1)(h) of the Antiterrorism Act, 1997, and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 14 years, along with a fine of Rs0.5 million. In case of default, he shall further undergo six months of simple imprisonment. Convicted under Section 419 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for seven years, along with a fine of Rs0.1 million. In case of failure to pay the amount, he shall further undergo three months of simple imprisonment.

",2019-01-09,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to file separate references on a series of matters stemming from the Bahria Town Karachi project, including the arrears of three Malir Development Authority (MDA) projects.

Under Justice Azmat Saeed's chairmanship, the apex court's three-member implementation bench passed the orders while hearing the Bahria Town case.

The court directed the corruption watchdog and other relevant departments to take action on the installation of illegal tube wells as well as payments made for sale and purchase of land.

The bench instructed NAB and others to also look into the ""K4 route issue"" and the outstanding payment of MDA's trio of projects which amounts to Rs1.5 billion.

If the references are not filed and the court orders are not adhered to, then action will be taken against NAB, the court warned.

At the outset of today's hearing, the counsel of plot allottees told the apex court that they were ready to pay whatever price the court would set.

""If the price is ascertained, then the rate would be of 2019,"" Justice Saeed made it clear.

Meanwhile, NAB furnished its report on the matter in the court today, adding that ""it has completed its inquiry and will now send a reference for approval"".

NAB investigation officer apprised the court that Bahria Town, as per the 2012 survey report, had held 12,156 acres of land but that the area currently in its possession has reached 25,601 acres.

The court noted that 7,220 acres of land was illegally transferred to Bahria Town in 2015, adding that the real estate developer claims that it has not illegally acquired the said land.

The Supreme Court bench ordered the Sindh government and law enforcement agencies to recover the said land before adjourning the case until January 15.

On Monday, the court had reprimanded NAB, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) and the administration of Bahria Town, over what it termed their ""non-cooperation"" in implementing a ruling of the apex court.

Justice Saeed had warned the respondents that the judges were ""about to lose their temperament"" and directed NAB to ensure progress ""through its actions"".

",2019-01-09,"The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) revealed before a Supreme Court bench on Wednesday that the licences of 16 pilots and 65 cabin crew of various airlines have been suspended for allegedly holding fake educational credentials.

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar was hearing a case relating to the verification of degrees of pilots and other staff of various airlines operating in the country.

The CAA counsel informed the bench that the verification of degrees of all airline staff had been completed, save for six. These six cases involve airline officials who are currently abroad.

See: Five PIA pilots have not even done matric, SC told

He stated the degrees of 16 pilots and 65 cabin crews turned out to be forged during the verification process. The licences of these staff members were subsequently suspended.

Justice Nisar during the hearing remarked that an impression prevailed that the authorities were acting with ""haste"" regarding the matter of educational credentials because of court orders. ""We do not want to prohibit anyone's livelihood,"" he added.

The top judge stressed that the record on the basis of which airline staff have been suspended should be correct.

The CAA lawyer stated that the pilots whose licences have been suspended have the right to appeal.

Appearing before the bench, a pilot complained that his licence was suspended even though ""my degree is genuine"". The chief justice, however, directed all airline officials to approach the relevant forums with their grievances.

The SC bench wrapped up the case, which it had taken up in May 2018, after hearing all the parties.

At a hearing in December, the CAA had informed the top court that the academic credentials of seven pilots of the Pakistan International Airlines had been found to be bogus and five of them had not even passed their matriculation exam.

",2019-01-09,"Complicated procedures, shipping delays, risk of fraud and misleading practices have put a damper on e-commerce optimism

Source: Shutterstock

Internet users in Pakistan have been buying and selling items since the days of infuriatingly slow dial-up connections. But it is only in the last few decades that online shopping has transformed consumer habits and revolutionised businesses all over the world.

According to State Bank of Pakistan stats, in Pakistan e-commerce industries witnessed a growth of 93.7% for the year 2018.

The sales of local and international e-commerce merchants for FY2018 have reached almost Rs40 billion.

This is good news. But where we celebrated reduced carbon emissions, rental cost cutting for retailers, availability of cheap deals and the ease of swift transactions as favourable byproducts of online marketplaces— long and complicated procedures, shipping delays, the risk of fraud and misleading practices have put a damper on e-commerce optimism.

Read: Pakistan’s booming e-commerce market is just getting started

Wins and drawbacks

The dynamics of online businesses in Pakistan have changed in the last few years. Today we are fortunate enough to have online marketplaces with:

proper payment systems in place

affordable ready-made solutions to start an online store and

the help of service providers to start a business on the internet.

Not only that, users have been building successful businesses utilising nothing but their personal profiles on major social media platforms with absolutely zero technical know-how of website building.

Online stores today have some semblance of transparency and are more personalised. Unlike other stores in the past, e-stores are now more reachable than ever; people operating behind online stores are known, their offices are public knowledge and they organise frequent press conferences.

Read: As Alibaba buys Daraz, many ask: what next?

But there also exists mistrust between buyers and sellers due to careless product entries, misleading pricing and other online services collapsing.

Companies invest plenty to gain sizable business but often fail to counter campaigns that damage the company’s reputation and the reputation of e-commerce as a whole.

Common misleading practices

1. Inaccurate product listing

Shopping starts from going through products in a category or in a search result. The idea is to find the required item fast, but nothing is more cumbersome than getting a completely unrelated product in the resulting list.

Optical clip lens for smartphones

Gimbals are popular among video makers worldwide. A photographer approached me during an event to know the price of a 'gimbal' I was using. But I was using a simple mini tripod (exactly what is shown in the screenshot). I asked him what made him call my mini tripod a gimbal. Following up to with his reply, a simple search on Daraz confirmed what misled him. Out of the first 16 items in that search, only three are actually gimbals.

What we have here is a product detail of an item. Interestingly, the two pictures of supposedly the same item show two entirely different products. But which one will the buyer purchase?

2. Not enough detail

Product description doesn't give much away

Without human interaction or examining the product in person, pictures and the corresponding description is the only way to learn about a product. International stores insist on paying attention to the presentation of a product in order to find a seller.

The description and specifications are hardly provided in our local stores, let alone be organised and relevant. Some of the top proclaimed stores sometimes don’t even provide proper product shots.

Of course, all we need to know about a fitness tracker before buying it is that it's 'black, leather, comfortable and trendy.'

3. Careless content writing

Careless and inaccurate content writing

Duplicating information is very common between similar products to cut the work load. This often misleads and confuses the customers.

Presenting here a 'smartphone lens' that can be used as a tripod.

When it comes to describing the products you sell, it pays to use the right words with their proper definition. Using the wrong terms to describe items not only makes a store look bad, it increases returns and charge backs. It can also land you in legal trouble.

4. Not knowing the product and its market

Keeping up with the change in the market is key to delivering quality products buyers are looking for. Cheap knock-offs of trending products take vendors nowhere, in fact it drags the host website down with them.

Mini AC

During the peak of the deadliest heat wave in Pakistan a few years ago, an impossibly affordable battery driven mini ""AC"" was introduced at Yayvo to beat the heat. It was sold in hundreds within days before the item was assigned a different title.

Turns out that the device was not at all how it was initially advertised.

The tiny toy AC claimed to keep a room cool enough in hot weather, but the description wasn't clear enough. The site advertised the product as if it was something larger and better than other cooling devices. In reality it was very small and could barely push air to a table distance. There was also a tray to put two or three cubes of ice in it. It was sold for Rs3,000 initially, while it is available in local shops for Rs500 only.

Surprisingly, it couldn't be found under the ""sold out"" label after a couple of days of its launch. After a few days it was listed again under a different title.

5. No stock management

Selling products without having them in position is what causes problems like delayed delivery, cancellation of the order or dispatching something entirely different.

Unhappy users naturally prefer trying their luck elsewhere, like real shops.

6. Defective items and replicas

Replicas are sent against the full price of original luxury products. Poorly made replicas of branded clothing made from extremely cheap fabric is common. Users receive faulty and damaged goods purchased directly from official vendors of reputed companies.

Cheap replicas

An unfortunate but recurring problem is that users receive defective items or replicas with lengthy return policies. Recently, a cousin received absolute garbage in the name of clothes, that didn't even last a day.

Wristwatches, jewellery, luxury gift items are charged for the original amount but instead, cheap replicas are sent to customers.

""Misleading Product Listing"" as they are termed, don't show the real picture of the products they sell. This is more common in clothing items.

7. Delivery issues

Gorilla pod after opening the package

Delivery guys are often found being aggressive in collecting the money first and not allowing buyers to open or inspect the package before. Often, customers recieve either a damaged product or an inaccurate one.

But according to the delivery guys (personal experience included), it is the company that tells them to collect the payment first.

8. Defaming other e-stores

Online campaign against an e-store

Sudden spike of complaints on social media targeting specific online store is a sign of nasty form of business competition done through engineered contents. This cold war plants the seeds of doubt in consumers, which apparently not only harms the targeted store but the entire e-commerce culture as well.

Digital marketing companies and supposed-users need to look at the larger picture and take responsibility by saying no to such campaigns that they would never admit to being a part of.

9. Overpricing and fake discounts

Overpriced camera

Not all stories of giving false discounts during mega sales events are fake and they are not limited to the discount seasons.

Overpricing an item and adding small discount while still keeping the price higher than the original is another decades-old practice, which has unfortunately migrated to digital market spaces.

Here a 700D camera, that is available for Rs55,000, is being sold for Rs58,000 with supposedly a '17% discount.'

10. Fake reviews

Fake review by a vendor

Reviews within e-stores are supposed to be an authentic way knowing a service, product or vendor but are often plagued by positive reviews that are fabricated. Negative reviews were never even published on many of the store websites.Users should leave a feedback and buyers must review their purchases in that section, whether good or bad. Review system of e-stores should be assigned symbols to separate buyers' reviews from general feedback.

Such a review system can discourage fraudulent vendors and will help professional sellers to grow and reach consumer numbers they deserve.

11. Reporting system

'Report' feature on AliExpress

Keeping an eye on every vendor and every product on massive online stores is not humanly possible. Reviews system works best to inform other consumers about the products but a 'report' option to management will be an efficient method in identifying suspicious vendors, faulty products and other important issues that require serious action.

And of course, a dedicated staff to monitor the reports is crucial in this accountability process.

12. After sales service

Who could deny the importance of 'After Sales Services.'

Yayvo's timely reply

Online businesses are no different in this regard. In fact, there’s more value in it since customers are going to order something they have not inspected in person. We have seen time and time again that in case of getting a defective or wrong item, the process of returning the product is often long and unfriendly, and getting the money back is a very painful process.

These complications can be reduced if only vendors double check the items they are dispatching.

How can it be fixed?

Leaving a buyer unhappy does not mean the loss of one customer. It means that one buyer can stop hundreds of potential buyers, and a happy buyer can multiply the business just as much.

By no means do all Pakistani online stores suffer the above-mentioned mountain of problems. Some are doing a phenomenal job, while some have more room for improvement than others.

To have happy buyers, companies under the spotlight need to act like true leaders and take responsibility to reduce damaging elements to the online shopping experience.

At this stage, they also have a responsibility to strengthen the foundation of e-commerce first, before chasing the title of ""the largest"".

At the end, I should add that there are web stores in the market that keep coming up in discussions for their professional approach. Presentation of products including pictures and necessary details on HomeShopping and AllMyTech, as well as their search results are far better than the top advertised and advanced e-stores.

Following are some suggested steps that can be useful in reducing the discussed threats to our e-commerce culture:

Provide proper training to content writers and vendors to present their products correctly.

Improve the in-store system of 'Product Reviews.'

Improve customer service as well as 'After Sale Services.'

Allow users to report a seller directly and easily to the concerned management.

Take necessary action toward incompetent vendors.

Strict action needs to be taken against scamming sellers under cyber-crime, and affected buyers should be compensated on a priority basis.

Stay in constant communication with other stores, share information regarding guilty sellers and discourage others from walking the same path by making the information public.

Do you agree with us? What Pakistani web stores do you visit? What improvements do you want to see online stores in Pakistan make?

",2019-01-09,"There's no denying that climate change is real, and so is our love for hot chocolate!

Nights are cooling down in Karachi and mornings are getting chillier, making it the perfect weather to enjoy a good ol' cuppa hot cocoa. But let us tell you, finding the perfect chocolate/cocoa concoction in this city hasn't been easy.

We get it. Hot chocolate is not our regional delicacy so it's obviously a struggle to get the drink right. The soft, velvety texture, the consistency and the balance between the bitter of cacao and the sweetness of sugar is difficult to master.

But what you can do is get as close to the original hot chocolate drink, or its European version, as possible.

Passionate for this festive winter beverage, we set out on an expedition of our own in Karachi to find the perfect cup of hot chocolate. We tried the drink from eight popular cafes in the city.

Here's who we thought serves the best (and worst) hot choc in town:

Winner: Butler's Chocolate Café

Let us tell you, being the hot chocolate-snobs that we are, we found Butler's hot chocolate selection the best among all.

First, we tried their regular Hot Chocolate, and for a person that cannot handle the bitterness of cocoa, it was perfect. Though a little more on the sweeter side, anyone who loves milk chocolate would love this concoction of sugar, milk and chocolate.

Honestly though, it left us disappointed. Because to us, hot chocolate isn't just cocoa powder mixed in milk and warmed up, it is a delicious elixir of true chocolate (which is different from cocoa powder) slowly dissolved in milk/water with other goodies thrown in for taste. So in our quest, we gave their Dark Hot Chocolate a try ─ and that blend emerged as the clear winner.

It was smooth. It was velvety. Most importantly, it was thick.

The texture and the consistency were just right. Our tastebuds could detect no added sugar, so its sweetness did not overpower the chocolate, which is what hot chocolate is about, or should be, anyway.

Runner Up: Lal's

The Viennese Hot Chocolate from Lal's Patisserie came in second from the eight places we tried.

Again, it wasn't bitter and not as velvety as it should be. An authentic Viennese hot chocolate contains egg yolk, but we doubt this had any as the drink did not feel thick enough at all.

The sugar and the milk proportion were right but it could really use a stronger unsweetened chocolate flavour.

Perhaps, they call it ""dark"" because hot chocolate (as it's supposed to be) may not be everyone's cup of ... chocolate?

Everyone in the middle:

We tried the hot chocolate beverage at a few other places and all of them had one thing or the other missing.

The hot chocolate at FLOC was still acceptable as it wasn't as sweet as some of what we tried at other places. But it failed to deliver the dark, bitter taste we were expecting.

FLOC's owner Fauzia Siddiqui told us that their hot chocolate is made from Lindt chocolate, but we felt its taste had been diluted by using too much milk.

The Classic Hot Chocolate from Vintage Cafe did not taste very 'classic', so to speak. It could definitely use a bigger helping of cocoa, and a lot less of sugar. Because what we had, tasted more like warmed up chocolate milk instead of the actual hot chocolate drink.

Mocca's hot chocolate was deceiving, to say the least. It had a nice, chocolatey brown colour, building up our expectations. But when we tried it, you could actually feel the heaviness of whole milk in it. The sugar overpowered the chocolate. It was thick and creamy, but not rich.

The hot chocolate at Espresso ranked after Mocca, though it was similar in texture and taste. Definitely milky, a sugar fest and not rich at all.

Out of the Race:

If disappointment had a taste, it would taste like the hot chocolate drinks at New York Coffee and Bella Vita. It felt like the hot chocolate served at NY Coffee was made with one of those Cadbury instant hot choc packets. The colour was a pale pinkish brown, and the consistency was way off.

The Bella Vita serving doesn't justify its price tag at Rs270+tax. The cup is tiny and the hot chocolate in it was a lot like hot Ovaltine milk, still more on the milkier side.

That's all from us for now on the best hot chocolate debate.

308,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456443/sc-to-hear-nabs-appeal-against-suspension-of-nawaz-maryam-sentences-on-jan-14,"SC to hear NAB's appeal against suspension of Nawaz, Maryam sentences on Jan 14
",2019-01-09,"The Supreme Court will hear the National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) appeal against the suspension of sentences handed to Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz — in the Avenfield reference — next week on January 14.

The appeal will be heard by a five-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and comprising Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, Justice Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mushir Alam and Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel.

The accountability court in July last year had announced the verdict in the Avenfield properties corruption reference filed by NAB, handing the ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif 10 years as jail time for owning assets beyond known income and 1 year for not cooperating with the bureau.

His daughter was given 7 years for abetment after she was found ""instrumental in concealment of the properties of her father"" and 1 year for non-cooperation with the bureau.

The father and daughter upon their return to Lahore on July 13 were arrested by NAB authorities and shifted to Adiala jail.

The Islamabad High Court (IHC) in September, however, granted them bail after suspending their sentences.

The corruption watchdog had subsequently filed an appeal — which was accepted by the SC — in which it contended that the IHC had failed to appreciate that, through its order, it had seriously prejudiced the case of the prosecution by holding that the trial court judgement suffered from obvious and glaring defects and infirmities and that the convictions and sentences handed down to the accused might not be sustained ultimately.

Nawaz's appeal against Al-Azizia

Earlier today, a two-member IHC allowed the former prime minister's request for the early hearing of his appeal against his conviction in the Al-Azizia/Hill Metal Establishment reference. The court directed that it be fixed for hearing within ten days.

Justice Amir Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani also set a petition seeking the suspension of Sharif's ­sentence for hearing.

Barrister Munawwar Duggal had on Tuesday filed an application seeking the immediate hearing of the appeal against the verdict announced by an accountability court in the reference on December 24 last year.

In the application, the defence counsel pointed out that the winter vacation had ended and, therefore, the appeal against the conviction might be fixed before the available bench.

Another IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Farooq had on Jan 7 taken up Sharif’s petition seeking the suspension of his sentence. The bench, however, pointed out that since the appeal against the conviction in the Al-Azizia-Hill Metal Establishment had neither been fixed nor taken up, the petition for suspension of the sentence could not be entertained at this stage.

The IHC on Tuesday, however, released an order deciding to take up the petition.

Accountability court judge Mohammad Arshad Malik had on Dec 24 convicted Sharif in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills Company (ASCL) and Hill Metal Establishment (HME) reference and awarded him seven years imprisonment and fined him Rs1.5 billion and $25 million.

Sharif filed a 61-page appeal against the verdict through Haris who pointed out certain ‘extraneous’ factors which accountability judges never consider while imparting judgements in routine cases.",Mohammad Imran | Haseeb Bhatti,"['supreme', 'court', 'hear', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'nab', 'appeal', 'suspension', 'sentences', 'handed', 'nawaz', 'sharif', 'daughter', 'maryam', 'nawaz', 'avenfield', 'reference', 'next', 'week', 'january', '14', 'appeal', 'heard', 'fivemember', 'bench', 'headed', 'chief', 'justice', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'comprising', 'justice', 'asif', 'saeed', 'khosa', 'justice', 'gulzar', 'ahmed', 'justice', 'mushir', 'alam', 'justice', 'mazhar', 'alam', 'khan', 'miankhel', 'accountability', 'court', 'july', 'last', 'year', 'announced', 'verdict', 'avenfield', 'properties', 'corruption', 'reference', 'filed', 'nab', 'handing', 'ousted', 'prime', 'minister', 'nawaz', 'sharif', '10', 'years', 'jail', 'time', 'owning', 'assets', 'beyond', 'known', 'income', '1', 'year', 'cooperating', 'bureau', 'daughter', 'given', '7', 'years', 'abetment', 'found', 'instrumental', 'concealment', 'properties', 'father', '1', 'year', 'noncooperation', 'bureau', 'father', 'daughter', 'upon', 'return', 'lahore', 'july', '13', 'arrested', 'nab', 'authorities', 'shifted', 'adiala', 'jail', 'islamabad', 'high', 'court', 'ihc', 'september', 'however', 'granted', 'bail', 'suspending', 'sentences', 'corruption', 'watchdog', 'subsequently', 'filed', 'appeal', 'accepted', 'sc', 'contended', 'ihc', 'failed', 'appreciate', 'order', 'seriously', 'prejudiced', 'case', 'prosecution', 'holding', 'trial', 'court', 'judgement', 'suffered', 'obvious', 'glaring', 'defects', 'infirmities', 'convictions', 'sentences', 'handed', 'accused', 'might', 'sustained', 'ultimately', 'nawaz', 'appeal', 'alazizia', 'earlier', 'today', 'twomember', 'ihc', 'allowed', 'former', 'prime', 'minister', 'request', 'early', 'hearing', 'appeal', 'conviction', 'alaziziahill', 'metal', 'establishment', 'reference', 'court', 'directed', 'fixed', 'hearing', 'within', 'ten', 'days', 'justice', 'amir', 'farooq', 'justice', 'mohsin', 'akhtar', 'kayani', 'also', 'set', 'petition', 'seeking', 'suspension', 'sharif', 'sentence', 'hearing', 'barrister', 'munawwar', 'duggal', 'tuesday', 'filed', 'application', 'seeking', 'immediate', 'hearing', 'appeal', 'verdict', 'announced', 'accountability', 'court', 'reference', 'december', '24', 'last', 'year', 'application', 'defence', 'counsel', 'pointed', 'winter', 'vacation', 'ended', 'therefore', 'appeal', 'conviction', 'might', 'fixed', 'available', 'bench', 'another', 'ihc', 'division', 'bench', 'comprising', 'chief', 'justice', 'athar', 'minallah', 'justice', 'farooq', 'jan', '7', 'taken', 'sharif', 'petition', 'seeking', 'suspension', 'sentence', 'bench', 'however', 'pointed', 'since', 'appeal', 'conviction', 'alaziziahill', 'metal', 'establishment', 'neither', 'fixed', 'taken', 'petition', 'suspension', 'sentence', 'could', 'entertained', 'stage', 'ihc', 'tuesday', 'however', 'released', 'order', 'deciding', 'take', 'petition', 'accountability', 'court', 'judge', 'mohammad', 'arshad', 'malik', 'dec', '24', 'convicted', 'sharif', 'alazizia', 'steel', 'mills', 'company', 'ascl', 'hill', 'metal', 'establishment', 'hme', 'reference', 'awarded', 'seven', 'years', 'imprisonment', 'fined', 'rs15', 'billion', '25', 'million', 'sharif', 'filed', '61page', 'appeal', 'verdict', 'haris', 'pointed', 'certain', 'extraneous', 'factors', 'accountability', 'judges', 'never', 'consider', 'imparting', 'judgements', 'routine', 'cases']","['sc', 'hear', 'nab', 'appeal', 'suspension', 'nawaz', 'maryam', 'sentences', 'jan', '14']"

An SC bench comprising Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Faisal Arab has been hearing an appeal filed by BNP against the IHC's order.

Through its lawyer Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, BNP in December last year had offered that they were ready to pay the CDA Rs15 billion for the regularisation of the plot over a 20-year period, on the assurance that an ongoing inquiry by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) would be dropped and they would be permitted to utilise the land for commercial ventures without any interference or restrictions from the CDA.

The bench had expressed surprise that the developer set a 20-year period to clear the CDA’s dues, but had directed that BNP's proposal be placed before the federal cabinet, which will in turn come up with a way to resolve the matter. However, the company's proposal was rejected by the CDA at the time.

Today, the bench gave BNP eight years to complete the payment of Rs17.5 billion in instalments for the plot's lease to CDA.

The order was given despite CDA's request to let the federal cabinet rule on the matter in a meeting scheduled to be held tomorrow. The bench maintained that the federal cabinet will not be able to rule on the matter as the CDA had already rejected the proposal by BNP.

Earlier in the hearing, the CDA raised objections on Justice Ahsan's inclusion on the bench, citing his previous association with BNP as their lawyer. The chief justice, however, dismissed the objection saying that Justice Ahsan's previous association with the BNP had no bearing on the current case.

""Was the CDA sleeping for 13 years [while the towers were being constructed]? Now, when two towers have been built, the authority is saying that they fall within the Margalla Hills National Park area and should be demolished,"" the chief justice said.

He added: ""The Supreme Court's building and the secretariat also fall in the area, shall those be demolished too?""

""People have bought apartments in the Grand Hyatt,"" he said while adding that half of Islamabad has been ""built wrong"".

""You [CDA] did not even have proper regulations, Tariq Fazl Chaudhry [former Capital Administration and Development Division (CADD) minister] had to write them for you. Is this the CDA's performance?"" Upon this the CDA Chairman Afzal Latif, who was present in court, said that employees of the authority had defrauded it.

""You did not remember this fraud for 13 years? Why should the people who spent four billion to buy those apartments have to suffer now,"" replied the chief justice.",dawn,"['supreme', 'court', 'wednesday', 'reversed', 'islamabad', 'high', 'court', 'order', 'upheld', 'july', '2016', 'cancellation', 'plot', 'meant', 'grand', 'hyatt', 'hotel', 'capital', 'development', 'authority', 'cda', 'violations', 'building', 'bylaws', 'ms', 'bnp', 'allotted', 'plot', 'purpose', 'constructing', 'luxury', 'grand', 'hyatt', 'hotel', '2004', 'instead', 'built', 'luxury', 'apartments', 'sold', 'various', 'buyers', 'buyers', 'include', 'highprofile', 'figures', 'prime', 'minister', 'imran', 'khan', 'sc', 'bench', 'comprising', 'chief', 'justice', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'justice', 'ijazul', 'ahsan', 'justice', 'faisal', 'arab', 'hearing', 'appeal', 'filed', 'bnp', 'ihc', 'order', 'lawyer', 'barrister', 'syed', 'ali', 'zafar', 'bnp', 'december', 'last', 'year', 'offered', 'ready', 'pay', 'cda', 'rs15', 'billion', 'regularisation', 'plot', '20year', 'period', 'assurance', 'ongoing', 'inquiry', 'national', 'accountability', 'bureau', 'nab', 'would', 'dropped', 'would', 'permitted', 'utilise', 'land', 'commercial', 'ventures', 'without', 'interference', 'restrictions', 'cda', 'bench', 'expressed', 'surprise', 'developer', 'set', '20year', 'period', 'clear', 'cda', 'dues', 'directed', 'bnp', 'proposal', 'placed', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'turn', 'come', 'way', 'resolve', 'matter', 'however', 'company', 'proposal', 'rejected', 'cda', 'time', 'today', 'bench', 'gave', 'bnp', 'eight', 'years', 'complete', 'payment', 'rs175', 'billion', 'instalments', 'plot', 'lease', 'cda', 'order', 'given', 'despite', 'cda', 'request', 'let', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'rule', 'matter', 'meeting', 'scheduled', 'held', 'tomorrow', 'bench', 'maintained', 'federal', 'cabinet', 'able', 'rule', 'matter', 'cda', 'already', 'rejected', 'proposal', 'bnp', 'earlier', 'hearing', 'cda', 'raised', 'objections', 'justice', 'ahsan', 'inclusion', 'bench', 'citing', 'previous', 'association', 'bnp', 'lawyer', 'chief', 'justice', 'however', 'dismissed', 'objection', 'saying', 'justice', 'ahsan', 'previous', 'association', 'bnp', 'bearing', 'current', 'case', 'cda', 'sleeping', '13', 'years', 'towers', 'constructed', 'two', 'towers', 'built', 'authority', 'saying', 'fall', 'within', 'margalla', 'hills', 'national', 'park', 'area', 'demolished', 'chief', 'justice', 'said', 'added', 'supreme', 'court', 'building', 'secretariat', 'also', 'fall', 'area', 'shall', 'demolished', 'people', 'bought', 'apartments', 'grand', 'hyatt', 'said', 'adding', 'half', 'islamabad', 'built', 'wrong', 'cda', 'even', 'proper', 'regulations', 'tariq', 'fazl', 'chaudhry', 'former', 'capital', 'administration', 'development', 'division', 'cadd', 'minister', 'write', 'cda', 'performance', 'upon', 'cda', 'chairman', 'afzal', 'latif', 'present', 'court', 'said', 'employees', 'authority', 'defrauded', 'remember', 'fraud', '13', 'years', 'people', 'spent', 'four', 'billion', 'buy', 'apartments', 'suffer', 'replied', 'chief', 'justice']","['sc', 'reverses', 'ihc', 'order', 'grand', 'hyatt', 'lease', 'orders', 'builder', 'pay', 'rs175bn', 'cda', '8', 'years']"

",2019-01-09,"Pakistani passport has moved up two spots on the 2019 Henley Passport Index but continues to remain the fifth-worst passport globally, offering its holders visa-free access to just 33 countries.

In the newly unveiled index, Pakistan occupies the 102nd spot as compared to the 104th spot in the previous list, reflecting a two-spot jump for the green passport. However, as was the case with the 2018 index, the Pakistani passport is better than only four other countries: Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

The Henley Passport Index is a ranking of all the world’s passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa.

The ranking is based on data from the International Air Transport Association, which maintains the world’s largest and database of travel information, and it is enhanced by extensive, ongoing research by the Henley & Partners Research Department.

Japan holds top spot on the Henley Passport Index for the second year running, offering citizens visa-free access to a record 190 destinations, whereas Singapore continues to hold 2nd place, along with South Korea, which has moved up from 3rd place, with citizens able to access 189 destinations.

From the 2nd place it held at the beginning of 2018, Germany now drops to 3rd place, with access to 188 destinations. It shares this position with France.

Denmark, Italy, Finland, and Sweden share joint 4th place, with access to 187 destinations around the globe.

The UK, meanwhile, drops from 4th place to 6th place, while the US drops from 5th place to 6th place, with visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 destinations.

In further demonstrations of Asian passport power, China moved five places up the rankings from the beginning of 2018, from 74th to 69th, while Cambodia (84th), Laos (86th), and Myanmar (90th) have each moved up four places.

Elsewhere, the Indian passport occupies the 79th spot in the rankings, sandwiched between African nations Ghana and Mozambique.

The UAE climbed five places up the rankings, from 27th place at the beginning of 2018, to 22nd place currently.

",2019-01-09,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar on Wednesday made it clear that the Supreme Court will not allow Indian content to be shown on Pakistani TV channels as it ""damages our culture"".

A three-member SC bench, under the chief justice's stewardship, was hearing an appeal by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority's (Pemra) against the high court's decision to lift the ban on the broadcast of Indian content on TV channels in Pakistan.

The Pemra counsel Zafar Iqbal Kalanauri apprised the SC bench that foreign content had been banned on court orders before a high court issued a stay order against it.

Pemra Chairman Saleem Baig told the court that 65 per cent of the content shown on Filmazia channel is foreign and that the number at times goes as high as 80 per cent.

At this, the chief justice remarked that ""we will not allow Indian content to be aired on [Pakistani] channels"".

Pemra counsel explained to the chief justice that ""Filmazia is not a news channel but is an entertainment channel; it does not do any propaganda.""

""It is, however, damaging our culture,"" the top judge countered.

The chief justice observed that the Pakistan Broadcasters Association's counsel, Faisal Siddiqui was not in attendance. ""We cannot pass a judgement without hearing him,"" he said.

Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till the first week of February.

In 2016, Pemra had imposed a complete ban on airing Indian content on local television and FM radio channels.

The decision was largely seen as a tit-for-tat move after similar actions were taken by some channels and the entertainment industry in India against Pakistani content and artists.

In 2017, the Lahore High Court had lifted the Pemra-imposed ban, declaring it null and void as the federal government had no objections regarding the same.

In October 2018, the Supreme Court had reinstated the ban on the transmission of Indian content on local television channels, setting aside the LHC orders.",Haseeb Bhatti,"['chief', 'justice', 'pakistan', 'mian', 'saqib', 'nisar', 'wednesday', 'made', 'clear', 'supreme', 'court', 'allow', 'indian', 'content', 'shown', 'pakistani', 'tv', 'channels', 'damages', 'culture', 'threemember', 'sc', 'bench', 'chief', 'justice', 'stewardship', 'hearing', 'appeal', 'pakistan', 'electronic', 'media', 'regulatory', 'authority', 'pemra', 'high', 'court', 'decision', 'lift', 'ban', 'broadcast', 'indian', 'content', 'tv', 'channels', 'pakistan', 'pemra', 'counsel', 'zafar', 'iqbal', 'kalanauri', 'apprised', 'sc', 'bench', 'foreign', 'content', 'banned', 'court', 'orders', 'high', 'court', 'issued', 'stay', 'order', 'pemra', 'chairman', 'saleem', 'baig', 'told', 'court', '65', 'per', 'cent', 'content', 'shown', 'filmazia', 'channel', 'foreign', 'number', 'times', 'goes', 'high', '80', 'per', 'cent', 'chief', 'justice', 'remarked', 'allow', 'indian', 'content', 'aired', 'pakistani', 'channels', 'pemra', 'counsel', 'explained', 'chief', 'justice', 'filmazia', 'news', 'channel', 'entertainment', 'channel', 'propaganda', 'however', 'damaging', 'culture', 'top', 'judge', 'countered', 'chief', 'justice', 'observed', 'pakistan', 'broadcasters', 'association', 'counsel', 'faisal', 'siddiqui', 'attendance', 'pass', 'judgement', 'without', 'hearing', 'said', 'subsequently', 'hearing', 'adjourned', 'till', 'first', 'week', 'february', '2016', 'pemra', 'imposed', 'complete', 'ban', 'airing', 'indian', 'content', 'local', 'television', 'fm', 'radio', 'channels', 'decision', 'largely', 'seen', 'titfortat', 'move', 'similar', 'actions', 'taken', 'channels', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'india', 'pakistani', 'content', 'artists', '2017', 'lahore', 'high', 'court', 'lifted', 'pemraimposed', 'ban', 'declaring', 'null', 'void', 'federal', 'government', 'objections', 'regarding', 'october', '2018', 'supreme', 'court', 'reinstated', 'ban', 'transmission', 'indian', 'content', 'local', 'television', 'channels', 'setting', 'aside', 'lhc', 'orders']","['allow', 'indian', 'content', 'damages', 'culture', 'cjp']"

",2019-01-09,"Suspicious packages were sent to more than a dozen foreign embassies and consulates ─ including the Pakistani mission ─ in major Australian cities on Wednesday in a seemingly orchestrated but scattershot campaign.

Emergency services raced to a string of diplomatic facilities which had received packages containing suspected hazardous material, all within the space of a few hours.

There was no obvious pattern to countries targeted, with consulates of Pakistan, the United States, China, Italy, India, Japan and New Zealand suffering scares.

The packages were not believed to be dangerous, but police, fire crews and forensic teams were urged to use breathing apparatus as they documented and double- or triple-bagged the materials for further testing.

Victoria Police said there was no threat to the public: ""At this time we believe the matter is targeted and not impacting the general community.""

Most of the sites ─ also including locations near the Spanish, Swiss, and Egyptian consulates ─ were evacuated as a precaution but have since been declared safe.

A British High Commission spokesperson said its consulate general in Melbourne had been targeted, but ""all our staff are safe and accounted for"".

The US consulate in the city said it had also received a ""suspicious"" package, which a spokesperson said was handled in coordination with police and the fire service.

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it had sent a note to all diplomatic missions in the capital on Tuesday, ""alerting them to the possibility of suspicious packages being delivered by mail"".

",2019-01-09,"Armed men attempted to stop former Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair's car near his residence in Phase VI of Karachi's DHA area on Tuesday night, DawnNewsTV reported citing police.

The former Sindh governor, according to Darakhshan police station's station house officer (SHO) Arshad Janjua, was returning home with his wife at 11:30pm on Tuesday when his vehicle was intercepted by three unidentified men in a car, with one of them pointing a gun at the PML-N leader, who managed to drive away.

Zubair, the brother of incumbent Finance Minister Asad Umar, reported the incident to the police and his statement was recorded, the SHO said.

Later in the day, a first information report of the incident was registered on the complaint of Zubair's son at Darakshaan police station.

A case has been registered against the unidentified suspects under Sections 324 (attempt to commit murder), 506 (2) (punishment for criminal intimidation), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

It is pertinent to mention here that the former governor was driving the vehicle himself and does not have any security assigned to him.

Following the incident, however, police officials were posted outside Zubair's residence on the orders of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) South Pir Muhammad Shah.

The SSP South also paid a visit to Zubair's residence along with Superintendent of Police Clifton Suhai Aziz and met the former governor's family.

Sindh Inspector General of Police Dr Syed Kaleem Imam took notice of the incident and sought a detailed inquiry report from the SSP South.

He directed the officer to take legal and security measures in light of Zubair's statement in order to hold the suspects involved accountable.

The incident came three weeks after MQM leader Ali Raza Abidi was murdered in DHA's Phase V neighbourhood. Abidi was shot outside his house by two unidentified assailants riding a motorcycle. The case is under investigation.

",2019-01-09,"ISLAMABAD: The electronic media regulator has advised television channels to observe decency in their non-news content.

In an advice issued to all TV channels, the Pakistan Ele­ctronic Media Regu­la­tory Authority (Pemra) on Tuesday asked them not to air dramas containing controversial themes, indecent clo­thing and gestures, controversial plots (involving infidelity and extramarital affairs, etc) and unnecessary details of events.

“Such content is not only distressing for viewers but is also against the commonly accepted standards of decency,” the Pemra advice said.

The regulator said the trend of airing quite bold themes in dramas had resulted in massive public complaints on the Pakistan Citizen Portal (PCP), Pemra Complaints Call Centre and Feedback System as well as on social media.

The Pemra statement said that viewers had severely criticised the content being telecast, and their opinion was that dramas were not depicting the true picture of Pakistani society.

“Indecent scenes, dialogues, extramarital relations, violence, inappropriate dressing, rape scenes, bed scenes, use of drugs and alcohol, and intimate moments between couples are being glamorised in utter disregard of Pakistani culture and values,” Pemra said.

Regulator says the trend of introducing bold themes in dramas has resulted in massive public complaints

It said that established religious beliefs about divo­rce and halala were being distorted through weak plots/storylines, creating confusion among viewers about religious principles.

The media regulator also advised the channels to come out of stereotypical ideas as a majority of the scripts re­­­­­volved around women, having the same story pick, plot or purpose and dramas depict hackneyed image of women.

“The script writers are confined to saas-bahu vendetta, extramarital affairs, divorce and infidelity etc,” the regulator said, adding that “all TV channels are, therefore, required to stop airing such content in dramas and produce content in consonance with socio-cultural norms as per aspirations of Pakistani society”.

",2019-01-09,"A Karachi-Islamabad re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) pipeline feeding industry, gas stations and domestic consumers in central Punjab was targeted in a bomb attack in Rahim Yar Khan early on Wednesday.

According to Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Ltd (SNGPL) sources, the blast was caused by a timed explosive device. The explosives were planted in the pipeline at Bhong Road in Sadiqabad near the Bhong Sui Gas repeater station A-1, Rescue 1122 officials said.

SNGPL's chief engineer transmission Muhammad Shoaib told Dawn that the RLNG pipeline, with a 36-inch diameter and wall thickness of 0.588 inches, was laid one year ago to supply gas from Karachi to Islamabad. The pipeline feeds the industry, gas stations and domestic consumers in central Punjab.

Shoaib said that last night terrorists had dug a three-foot hole at the main RLNG pipeline and fixed a device at the top, which blew up the pipeline.

He said the incident took place at 2:40 am adding that the system was under control by 3:05 am. Shoaib said that rehabilitation work of the pipeline had started and it would be restored in the next 48 hours.

Assistant Commissioner (AC) Sadiqabad Abbas Raza Nasir described the blast as ""a terrorist act"". Following the attack, eight firetrucks under Rescue 1122, SNGPL and a private factory reached the spot to extinguish the fire.

AC Nasir told Dawn that SNGPL engineers had also arrived at the site of the blast and that two scientists were expected to arrive shortly to conduct forensic tests. According to the AC, restoration will take between 24 and 48 hours.

According to SNGPL's Muhammad Shoaib, nearly 40 to 50 blasts have taken place in the area since 2002. He said that last month terrorists had fixed an explosive device at the RLNG pipeline near Sadiq canal in Sardar Garh but security guards had intervened in a timely manner and removed the bomb. The terrorists, however, had escaped.

A gas crisis hit Pakistan in December and proliferated across the country, forcing industry closures across Punjab and Karachi, even as domestic consumers in many areas faced low gas pressure and outages.

317,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456431/learning-from-china-may-not-be-as-simple-as-pm-khan-believes,"Learning from China may not be as simple as PM Khan believes
",2019-01-09,"PRIME Minister Imran Khan is fascinated by China’s miraculous feat of lifting 800 million ­people from poverty — and he seeks to emulate that achievement. Then again, who does not? Every speech of his, whether at home or abroad, is invariably laced with profuse praise of the ­emerging superpower. But it seems that he has ­little understanding of how it happened.

The rise of China is surely an amazing story, and its record in poverty reduction is without parallel in human history. It may not be possible for other countries to emulate the Chinese dream, yet there are lessons to learn from the country’s Great Leap Forward. The transformation of a country with around one fifth of the world’s population could not have come without the Communist Revolution in 1949 that destroyed the regressive social structure, thereby paving the way for a second revolution which led to phenomenal economic growth.

Since the initiation of China’s reform and opening-up in 1978, it has achieved an annual average 9.5 per cent growth rate, increasing almost 35 times in size within the last four decades. There is no precedent in history of such sustained economic growth. This could not have been possible without political stability, a visionary leadership and strong institutions of the state.

Our prime minister must realise that societal transformation requires clear vision.

It was the second stage of the revolution headed by Deng Xiaoping, who was also one the leaders of the 1949 revolution, that led to the building of modern China. The principles enunciated by Deng guided Chinese policy since the 1980s. According to him, there are three criteria to judge whether or not a political system or policy is suitable or correct for a country, namely; is it beneficial for political stability, economic development and living standards? If it is for all three, then it is a good system or policy.

With its phenomenal scale of economic growth, China also focused on improving the lives of ordinary Chinese people. The enormous improvement in living standards is, therefore, the most important achievement China has made since the reform and opening-up. For a country with huge numbers of poor people streaming into its cities, many ­living initially in conditions of abject misery, this has been an extraordinary success.

Other factors that contributed to China’s economic and social development are the massive investments it made on education and population control. For almost four decades, China strictly implemented a one-child policy that had helped the country achieve its anti-poverty drive. This policy has now been made more flexible to meet the demands of an expanding economy.

More importantly, successive Chinese leaders recognised that economic development and political stability were intertwined. While its entire focus had been on economic development, China has kept itself out of outside conflicts and avoided confrontation despite provocations. It has kept a relatively low profile, notwithstanding its position as a superpower.

When Imran Khan says that he wants to learn from China, he should understand that such ­societal transformation can only occur when one has a clear vision and the will to make tough decisions. It is indeed commendable that the PTI ­government places greater emphasis on human development, but the welfare of the people also depends on political stability and economic ­development. Catchy mantras alone will not take this country out of its current predicament.

Sure, Pakistan has a different system of government and there is no revolutionary party at the helm, but it is not difficult to implement some radical reforms to put the economy on the track of sustainable growth. There is also need for change in existing social and economic structures that are the biggest obstacles to the country’s transformation. But, notwithstanding Imran Khan’s grand idea of establishing ‘Naya Pakistan’, the PTI remains a party with no clear strategy for change. Almost five months into power, the government is still unable to set a clear direction.

There appears to be systemic failure in this country. While the PTI government is drifting without vision or purpose, growing political instability has rendered the system dysfunctional. One cannot hope getting the economy off the ground, let alone fighting poverty, in this environment of political confrontation. The country is not expected to move forward while depending on the financial support of friendly countries. It is ­disgraceful the way that bailout packages from Saudi Arabia and the UAE are being portrayed as diplomatic successes. In the absence of any clear agenda for reform, these kinds of temporary relief could become liabilities, further dragging the economy down.

There is as yet no indication that the government is prepared to change its confrontationist policy. More alarming is that it does not have any clear strategy to deal with the challenges it faces. Undoubtedly, corruption is a serious problem, but the government seems to only focus on this one issue. Imran Khan’s claim that it is the main cause of all economic and political ills is exaggerated. The senseless campaign has increased economic and political uncertainty, making it more difficult to carry out any reform. Imran Khan often cites China’s latest campaign against corruption. But what he has failed to understand is that China has been able to effectively counter the menace after it had consolidated its economy.

Instead of learning from China how it emerged as an economic superpower in such a short span of time, Imran Khan has superficially picked some aspects of its history to point to. A major factor that has caused Pakistan’s economic and political slide is the absence of a long-term vision for ­development and social change.

China’s model cannot be emulated, but one can, at least, learn some lessons from its success. Poverty eradication, which Imran Khan appears so fascinated with, did not come without economic development and social reform. The establishment of shelter homes for the homeless is indeed a ­positive step, but it cannot address the basic ­problem behind rampant poverty, unemployment and social backwardness.

318,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456427/will-the-govt-be-able-to-break-the-nfc-deadlock,"Will the govt be able to break the NFC deadlock?
",2019-01-09,"THE consultation process for the ninth National Finance Commission (NFC) to strike a deal on the eighth Award is expected to start in the last week of the current month. To serve the spirit of fiscal federalism it is imperative for the federal and provincial tiers of government to prepare intelligently in order to deal with a contentious agenda.

Unfortunately, there is little evidence of homework being done at the centre and sub-national levels beyond the political statements at this point. This is despite the fact that the next award is expected to alter both the inter-provincial and the centre-provinces resource sharing arrangement.

The new population census and the merger of Fata with KP necessitate revising the current resource sharing formula.

No one in Islamabad had a clear explanation why the Ministry of Finance is calling the shots over the NFC when there is a separate ministry to manage relationships amongst the federating units

The assertions from influential quarters, the International Monetary Fund, the federal Ministry of Finance and the security establishment, mean that there will be demand to rebalance the consolidated share of provinces and the centre. It may be noted that constitutionally scaling down the provincial share of the total resource pie is forbidden.

The enormity of the challenge and its link to peace, national unity and economic stability demands leveraging all platforms that can facilitate dialogue in this regard.

In Pakistan, however, often the most obvious choice fails to capture the attention of the rulers. During background research it was intriguing to discover that the Ministry of Interprovincial Coordination has been excluded from the process of deciding the economic dynamics of the relationship between federating units and the centre.

No one in Islamabad had a clear explanation why the Ministry of Finance is calling the shots over the NFC when there is a separate ministry to manage relationships amongst the federating units. Some senior bureaucrats blamed the historic tendency to centralise and control.

“The federal Ministry of Finance enjoys the same status in the ministries as the finance minster amongst his other cabinet colleagues. It is vested with the responsibility of budgeting and it controls the purse strings.

“It should not be a surprise that the finance ministry acts as first amongst equals. There is a reason why it is often referred to as the ‘mother of all other ministries’,” a senior officer grunted. “Its behaviour generates heart burn more than it serves any purpose,” he added narrating stories of high-handedness.

Fehmida Mirza, Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination, currently heading a committee to fix sports issues, did not respond to Dawn’s request for comments. Jamil Ahmed, federal secretary of the Ministry of Inter Provincial Coordination, defended the government.

“It is for everyone to see that the PTI-government has given high priority to the issue of financial devolution. After the appointment of non-statutory members by all four provinces, hopes are high that soon a new deal will be struck paving the way for a more equitable resource sharing formula.

“No, we are not in the loop on matters related to the finance commission or the award. This falls in the domain of the Ministry of Finance. If you ask for my opinion I think it is handled better in the current arrangement. Our ministry lacks the capacity to handle such technical financial issues,” he said apologising for a weak website of the coordination ministry.

Finance Minister Asad Umar was also approached but his response did not reach till the time of the filing of this report.

Arif Khan, federal finance secretary, convinced of the centrality of his ministry in dealing with issues of economic management, told Dawn that despite its preoccupation with multiple pressing issues the ministry hopes to start the process of negotiations in the coming weeks. It was reported last week that the reference for ninth NFC reconstitution is with President Dr Arif Alvi pending action.

The ninth Commission was constituted as per Constitutional requirement by the PML-N government in 2015 but the reluctance of the provinces, fearful of a possible cut in their share, stalled the process.

The last government also failed to give the issue the attention it deserved. To its credit Prime Minister Khan’s government succeeded in mobilising the provinces to forward the names of non-statutory members necessary to restart deliberations on resource sharing, soon after it assumed power.

Under the last agreed resource distribution formula the share of provinces had been raised to 57.5 per cent with the centre getting residual 42.5pc of the divisible pool.

It is fact that without justifiable reasons and despite the fast changing economic and political situation, the validity period of the seventh NFC Award (implemented in July 2010) was extended beyond 2015 because of inaction on this count. The long interval did not serve well as it deprived the stakeholders a chance to discuss and resolve issues, as they emerged, in the spirit of mutual cooperation.

The hierarchy at the federal Ministry of Finance insisted that Mr Khan’s government is committed to financial federalism and has instructed the relevant functionaries to move swiftly to strike the next deal for amicable resource distribution, keeping the changing demands in sight.

Experts maintain that without formal notification of population census results, the commission may not be able to progress because of reservations of participating members over the results.

“What is stopping the government to convene the meeting of the Council of Common Interest to settle issues and create an environment conducive for achieving a consensus on the eighth NFC award,” a source involved in the process commented.

",2019-01-09,"AS the exercise to finalise the 12th five-year plan enters high gear, perhaps the planners can take a moment to reflect on how the story of the previous plan worked out.

Pakistan’s economy keeps going round in the same vicious cycle of boom and bust, something that is evident in the growth targets that are being set in the 12th plan. Average growth is being targeted for 5.8pc over the plan period, as per reports from within the consultative process.

Considering that, this year, GDP growth was supposed to come in at 6.2pc in the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan will be lucky if it touches the revised target of 4pc, given the rapid slowdown in the pace of economic activity that is still continuing.

This is the cycle that the 12th plan must aim to break, where growth rates climb for a few years, only to come crashing down rapidly, sending disruptive shocks reverberating through the economy. The framers of the 11th plan were aware of this.

“Most episodes of the GDP growth have come to an abrupt halt because of deteriorating balance of payments,” they said in the plan document, pointing to inelastic exports with imports that are highly elastic to growth. “The plan aims to maintain a sustained BoP position for ensuring macroeconomic stability,” they claimed.

But that was five years ago. Today, that plan document reads like an antiquated scroll, littered with tales of disasters past and prophecies of a shining future.

“The capital and financial account will be strengthened by diversifying sources of financing,” the planners promised, “with greater recourse to non-debt-creating sources of financing.” Yet as the years progressed, they partook of external debt, creating inflows with a heady and reckless abandon.

They had no other choice, since very little had been done to promote a diversification of the export base or to address other underlying rigidities. They sought “to put Pakistan’s economy on a robust growth trajectory” and “ensure a stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation and sound internal and external balances” at the plan end.

Yet here we are, drawing up another plan to once again jumpstart a moribund growth process. Will the drafters of the 12th plan be writing yet another antiquated scroll? Or do they have genuinely new ideas about how to break this cycle of boom and bust? We will soon find out.

320,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456425/editorial-if-jit-findings-can-be-modified-what-is-the-true-value-of-the-report,"Editorial: If JIT findings can be modified, what is the true value of the report?
",2019-01-09,"THE Joint Investigation Team model of accountability appears to have suffered a fresh setback and a thorough reassessment of the model is necessary.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court intervened to order the removal of the names of Chief Minister Sindh Murad Shah and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari from the JIT report on the so-called fake bank accounts case. The Supreme Court has also directed the federal government to remove the names of the two PPP leaders from the Exit Control List.

The apex court’s intervention may help cool the frenzy of speculation that erupted after the court-ordered JIT report was made public. Substantially adding to the confusion was the PTI’s apparent willingness to force immediate political change in Sindh. Perhaps all sides ought to consider their role in further muddying the accountability waters in the country.

To begin with, serious as the allegations in the JIT report are, a JIT report is not a conclusive finding of fact by a court of law.

Indeed, the intervention of the superior judiciary using its suo motu powers effectively circumvents the regular investigation and judicial processes, and can create distortions that can be difficult to justify. In the present instance, it was the Supreme Court that ordered the creation of a JIT to probe the so-called fake accounts case and present its findings to the court.

If the JIT is assumed to have acted in good faith, then its findings ought to be assessed fairly and transparently. But in ordering that the names of certain individuals be deleted from the JIT report, the Supreme Court has exercised its discretionary power to effectively overrule the JIT report without there being a clear legal reason for doing so.

Certainly, the Supreme Court’s apparent desire to extend respect and dignity to constitutional office holders and leaders of major political parties is laudable under the circumstances, but if JIT findings can be summarily modified, overturned or erased, then what is the true value of the JIT report in the first place?

The accountability process in the country is undeniably flawed, but a better accountability process does not lie in ad hoc solutions such as JITs and arbitrary arrests. If accountability is to be fair and transparent, and convictions are to be sustained on appeal, the regular processes and institutions of investigation, prosecution and adjudication ought to be strengthened.

The PTI government is clearly committed to ramping up accountability; can the federal government not empower the institutions that have the expertise and lawful authority to investigate and prosecute corruption?

The JIT fiasco could allow the PPP leadership to avoid answering in the court of public opinion the very serious corruption allegations that have been made public. Circumventing normal systems does not necessarily lead to extraordinary results — more often than not it leads to no results whatsoever.

",2019-01-09,"HARIPUR: Child abuse cases are increasing day by day and need to be curbed through a holistic approach otherwise such incidents would continue to deface the society.

Speakers said this at an awareness seminar organised jointly by Society for Peace and Conflict Management, University of Haripur, and district police here on Tuesday. They said that it was quite unfortunate that minor children were not safe from pedophiles whose presence was not restricted to a specific ethnic or socioeconomic group, but they were found within families of victims, schools, seminaries, acquaintances, police and other sections of society.

“It’s quite unfortunate that minor children of even three years of age who need to be engaged in physical and mental grooming are being taught what is good and what is bad touch,” said Younas Majaz, Haripur Union of Journalists president.

He said the current trend in the country indicated that every household with children was at risk. He criticised media coverage of children becoming victims of sexual abuse and called for avoiding playing up such cases.

Rafia Jadoon, sub-divisional officer education, said that unchecked use of mobile and internet by children was one of the contributing factors towards child abuse and the parents should monitor their children’s day-to-day activities.

She suggested incorporation of child protection measures in syllabus of educational institutions.

Advocate Gulnaz Rasheed said that the small number of convictions in child abuse cases was a proof of flawed FIRs and poor investigation.

Sadaqat Khan, member district public safety commission, said that despite being semi-conservative the society of Hazara division received the stigma of Faryal rape and murder in Havelian. He said that during last two years Hazara alone witnessed 130 cases of violence against children.

District police officer Dr Zahidullah said that concerted efforts were imperative for checking crimes against children. He announced setting up of a child protection unit in the district and sought support in creating awareness against child abuse in the society.

Dr Abdul Muhaiman, head of Islamic Studies Department of the university, also spoke on the occasion.

KILLED: An industrial worker was killed when a truck hit his motorcycle near Kot Najibullah interchange. Local police said that Mohammad Sheraz of Pandori village was on way to Hattar Industrial Estate for duty when a speeding truck (2160 LHR) hit his bike, killing him on the spot.

Meanwhile, the local police recovered body of a man from guava orchards in Gehr Khan village here on Tuesday. The man, identified as Tahir Ayub, 40, of Muradabad village, was missing from his house since Monday, police said.

The hospital sources said that the cause of death was stabbing with dagger. Family sources said that they had no enmity and did not nominate anyone in the FIR.

Addressing a press conference at Peshawar press Club, the elders, led by Bazaar Gul Afridi, the president of Khyber Union, said that government had formed a constituency of provincial assembly in each tehsil of Khyber tribal district -- Jamrud, Bara and Landi Kotal.

Mr Afridi said that provincial assembly seat PK-105 was given to Landi Kotal, PK-106 to Jamrud and PK-107 to Bara tehsil but Election Commission of Pakistan did not bother to check population of those areas before announcement of the constituencies.

He alleged that the delimitation was carried out on the recommendations of local leaders of the ruling PTI to accommodate their own people. He said that the constituencies were so vast that those were connected to Afghanistan on one side and to Kurram tribal district on the other side.

Mr Afridi said that many displaced people of Bara were still living in camps. If timely steps were not taken for their rehabilitation, they would be deprived of their right to vote, he added.

He said that tribal people would not accept the ‘controversial’ census. He urged the government and ECP to re-conduct the census and increase number of provincial assembly seats in Khyber.

Mr Afridi said that tribal people would agitate if their demands were not accepted immediately. He said that government should also take pragmatic steps for welfare of the people without wasting time.

He said that people in Khyber district were still deprived of clean drinking water, education and health facilities despite tall claims of the rulers. He asked the government to repair and reconstruct the damaged and destroyed educational institutions, healthcare centres and roads.

Mr Afridi also demanded increase in the compensation amount for rehabilitation of the displaced families.

",2019-01-09,"ISLAMABAD: Missing children and refusals by parents are the key challenges facing the eradication of polio in Pakistan, World Health Organisation Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday.

Addressing a press conference at the WHO head office on his last day in the country, Dr Ghebreyesus said: “Pakistan also needs to stop transmission of virus of crippling disease from Afghanistan. Our New Year’s wish is ‘zero’ polio by end of 2019.

The children of Pakistan and the children of the world deserve nothing less. Failure to eradicate polio would result in global resurgence of the disease, with as many as 200,000 new cases every year, all over the world.”

Dr Ghebreyesus was accompanied on his second official visit to Pakistan by WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari.

During his visit, he met with President Dr Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Health Services (NHS) Minister Aamer Mehmood Kayani, Foreign Affairs Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Finance Minister Asad Umar, Planning, Development and Reforms Minister Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar and Human Rights Minister Dr Shireen Mazari.

He said he was “glad to see” political will to address health-related issues, pointing to Mr Khan’s visits to hospitals in the capital as well as the government’s decision to double the health budget – currently 0.9pc of the GDP – this year and increasing it to 5pc in five years. He also praised the decision to impose a ‘sin’ tax on cigarettes and sugary beverages.

Dr Ghebreyesus said that “major investment should be made in primary healthcare”, adding that the government’s plans are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.

“Family planning and stunting of over 40pc of children are very important issues. Every child’s first 1000 days are very important and policies should focus on them,” he said.

He added that the WHO would provide all the necessary support to implement the Prime Minister’s National Health Programme and to address the critical issue of stunting and malnutrition in Pakistan.

Dr Ghebreyesus also called on Mr Khan on Tuesday, accompanied by the president of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Development Division, Dr Christopher Elias.

He said the WHO had increased its focus on public health, country-level impact and improving people’s access to health-related knowledge and information. He also told Mr Khan about the WHO’s ongoing programmes and projects in the country, explaining that the organisation has increased its level of support in Pakistan considerably mainly due to intensified polio eradication activities.

Mr Khan said the government is determined to implement a transformative social and economic agenda for a ‘new Pakistan’ and reiterated his commitment to move forward with thesustainable development agenda.

Dr Elias also delivered a letter from Bill Gates to Mr Khan at their meeting.

",2019-01-09,"ISLAMABAD: Tough times are ahead for land grabbers in the capital as a decision has been made to include them in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).

The capital administration and police jointly prepared a list of land grabbers operating in the capital which included the names of 22 people, said officials in the administration and police. The land grabbers employed goons and henchmen and used them to terrorise the citizens and grabbed their land.

Criminal activities, including land grabbing, reported to the police against the suspects were also checked and examined to take action against them. The Special Branch also prepared a report and sent it to the authorities concerned.

A decision was taken to include the names of all such elements in the watch list to effectively counter their activities. But later it was decided that the extreme action would be initiated against the top 10 land grabbers.

In this regard, a recommendation was made by the police to the capital administration for implementation. After approving, the capital administration sent the recommendation to the officer concerned for issuing a notification.

After inclusion in the watch list, the police can check the land grabbers’ and their kin’s bank accounts besides seeking details of their properties. Their criminal activities could be minimised if their movement is restricted, said the officials.

In late 2018, the capital administration included the name of Imtiaz Ali Khokhar alias Taji Khokhar and his son Farrukh Imtiaz Khokhar in the Fourth Schedule of the ATA on the request of the police for their alleged involvement in illegal activities, including land grabbing.

The land grabbers in connivance with the police and administration used to occupy land in the capital, said a senior official.

An inquiry conducted by a district and sessions judge in 2009 had stated: “…. the then civil judge, Islamabad was hand in gloves with the land mafia and glaringly misused his judicial authority for his personal gains, therefore, he deserves to be proceeded against for above misdeeds. In these adventures, Islamabad police, particularly PS Sihala was completely at their disposal.”

It added: “Like police, revenue department is completely under the thumb of …”

The police recommend the name of any person to the district administration for inclusion in the watch list after they are found involved in terrorism and linked with any banned outfit or terrorists. Besides, spreading sectarian, hatred and being involved in heinous crime can also be a ground for putting someone in the Fourth Schedule. On the recommendation of the police, the district administration includes the name of any person in the watch list.

After inclusion in the list, the person is bound to submit an affidavit of good behaviour to the area police. They are also bound to inform the police before going outside the district and upon their return.

“Without the permission from the district administration, the Fourth Schedulers cannot leave their city,” a police officer said.

",2019-01-09,"RAWALPINDI: In order to put an end to the VIP culture, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) scrapped all protocols and extraordinary arrangements for government and non-government officials across the country.

This was done on the directive of the airlines’ president Air Marshal Arshad Malik who asked the PIA to follow the regular procedure at all level.

The president and chief executive officer of the national flag-carrier will also not be able to enjoy protocol and extraordinary arrangements.

The PIA also launched an austerity campaign and withdrew staff reserved for facilitating the cabin crew members and redeployed them on their normal duties at airports across Pakistan.

According to sources, the PIA management put an end to the special treatment being provided to its pilots and cabin crew.

The facilitating staff has been withdrawn leaving the airlines’ crew members to handle their baggage on their own.

The staff has been redeployed on normal duties, including wheelchair handling. In addition, the cabin crew rooms have also been abolished.

The airlines claimed that the move was part of ongoing reforms and austerity steps and to improve service delivery.

The PIA was providing loaders to the cabin and cockpit crew at the time of boarding and disembarking for carrying their luggage. The loaders were provided extra allowances for the special duties.

The airline management had to provide a separate room for loaders with a telephone facility at each airport where at least three to four loaders remained on an alert and had to carry the baggage of crew members, including pilots, stewards and airhostesses.

“Sometimes the loaders also got tips from crew members for carrying their baggage to and from the airplane,” a senior official of the airlines said, adding this facility had continued for about 30 to 40 years.

None of the other airlines was offering such a facility to their crew members.

A PIA spokesman said the loaders had been redeployed for facilitating passengers, especially those with special needs. The redeployed staff will help passengers using wheelchairs during arrival and departure.

According to a source, the NAB Lahore initiated probe against the bureaucrat following information that he allegedly owned over 60 properties here and abroad.

The properties include rice mills and filling stations. Of the total properties, Mr Iqbal made 47 during his service and remaining he received in shape of gifts, the source said.

",2019-01-09,"LAHORE: The irrigation department’s willingness to provide 100 cusecs to the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) from the Bambawala-Ravi-Bedian (BRB) Canal’s Batapur point has finally paved the way for launching a mega water treatment project for clean drinking water.

The project was stalled since long as the authorities thought its cost could be reduced if Wasa was provided with water from the canal at Batapur rather than its point situated across the river Ravi, it is learnt.

“The irrigation department has now agreed to allow Wasa to get the canal water from the Batapur (GT Road) which will reduce the cost of laying of pipes for 10 to 12km. The department had earlier selected the canal’s point that comes after crossing of the river Ravi but the experts went against it and suggested Batapur point,” a senior Wasa official told Dawn on Tuesday.

The agency plans to set up a huge water treatment plant near the canal. The plant would make the canal water drinkable after treatment and provide it to the Lahorites through underground pipes. The objective of launching the project is to avoid fast depletion of the water table due to public and private sectors’ tube wells, domestic pumps etc. In an effort to resolve the issue, Wasa had decided to launch the project and complete it on a fast track.

“The irrigation department would provide Wasa with 100 cusecs of canal water daily that would first be made drinkable through treatment and then supplied to the citizens. Initially, the areas in north-east Lahore will get the supply of this treated water,” the official explained.

He said the provincial government would release funds for the project after its approval.

Talking about other mega projects, the official said Wasa had a plan to establish initially three wastewater treatment plants to treat wastewater (rain and sewer water) and discharge it into the Ravi.

“This scheme is also under the approval phase these days and we have already assured the Supreme Court to establish three wastewater plants at Mehmood Booti, Shadbagh and Shahdara. Three more such plants would be established at various city points at a later stage,” he said.

HOUSING SCHEMES: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) dismantled the entire infrastructure of seven illegally developed housing schemes. The schemes where the teams launched operation were Capital City, Gulshan-e-Mehrab, GC Garden, Gulshan-e-Haidar, Al-Wahab Garden, Satellite Town and Rachna Town, according to a spokesman.

ENCROACHMENTS: The City administration continued its anti-encroachment operation, demolishing illegal structures and sealing six shops for displaying goods outside their premises.

“The operation is going on indiscriminately without any pause and assistant commissioners are observing all roads and areas,” said a spokesman for the city admin.

He said the anti-quackery drive was also in full swing and health officials sealed City Medical Centre at Garhi Shahu being run by a quack, Azeem Khan. “A case was also registered against the quack,” he added.

APPROVED: The Provincial Development Working Party approved various development schemes, including Rehabilitation of 662 Dysfunctional Rural Water Supply Schemes (Revised), worth Rs8.195bn.

",2019-01-09,"LAHORE: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Lahore, has decided to file a reference against Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz in the Ramzan Sugar Mills case.

“NAB has decided to file a reference against Hamza Shahbaz for his alleged role being chief executive of the Ramzan Sugar Mills to get constructed a bridge facilitating his mills out of the public money in Chiniot,” a senior official told Dawn on Tuesday.

An amount of Rs200 million was approved by then chief minister and Hamza’s father Shahbaz Sharif for the construction of the bridge.

He said the reference was likely to be filed by the end of this month.

The National Accountability Bureau has already announced filing a reference against Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif in the Ramzan Sugar Mills case.

According to the NAB, Shahbaz Sharif, being chief minister of Punjab, had issued a directive for the construction of a drain in Chiniot district primarily to benefit the sugar mills owned by his sons.

The PML-N president misused his authority as Punjab chief minister to benefit factories owned by his sons, it said.

Hamza’s brother Salman Shahbaz is also facing similar charges being director of the mills but the bureau has not yet decided whether to include his name in the reference or not.

Salman Shahbaz is in the United Kingdom.

According to NAB, Salman left the country to skip its hearings.

Hamza was stopped from leaving the country at Lahore airport last month as his name was on the exit control list (ECL).

Hamza is also facing an inquiry in income beyond means case.

",2019-01-09,"KARACHI: The Grand Democratic Alliance has demanded from the federal government to give substantial package for Sindh and urged Prime Minister Imran Khan to formulate policies pertaining to Sindh in consultation with its allies in the province.

This demand was made by the GDA core committee comprising chiefs of the four political parties and leaders in the alliance.

The participants in the meeting, presided over by Pir Pagara at his residence here in Kingri House on Tuesday, reviewed the overall evolving situation in the country with specific reference to political developments in Sindh, ongoing investigation against the PPP leaders and organisational matters of the alliance.

Rules out any alliance with PPP and reposes confidence in accountability process

The meeting which lasted for over three hours was attended by Pir Sadruddin Shah Rashdi of PML-F, Ayaz Latif Palijo of QAT, Dr Safdar Abbasi of PPP-Workers, Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim of Peoples Muslim League, Murtaza Khan Jatoi of NPP, Dr Zulfiqar Mirza, Hasnain Mirza, Sardar Ali Gohar Khan Mahar, Tariq Hasan Khan, Nusrat Sahar Abbasi, Nand Kumar Goklani, Sardar Ghaus Bux Khan Mahar and others.

Ruling out possibility of any political alliance with the Pakistan Peoples Party in the near future, the GDA reiterated its determination to continue to raise its voice for rights of people in the elected houses.

It also extended its full support to the ongoing accountability process in the country and demanded that the process be taken to its logical end and all corrupt elements be taken to task.

Briefing journalists after the meeting, Pir Sadruddin Shah said that the alliance after reviewing political situation decided to further stabilise and activate the alliance and organise it at the grass-roots level.

He said that Sindh was infested with problems and those responsible for the situation were known to people and media very well.

“However we will raise all the pressing issues and voice of the people from every forum.”

Replying to a question, Ayaz Latif Palijo said that the alliance fully supported the ongoing accountability process, which was going in the right direction, because all those who had plundered the national kitty or resources of Sindh did not deserve any concession.

“It is a long-standing demand that the corrupt people are taken to their logical end.”

Mr Palijo described the condition of the health institutions in Sindh as pathetic.

Growers of sugar cane were deprived of the price fixed by the government for their crops, he said.

He said that the government had announced that it would make recruitments in government departments and in this connection the vacancies should be filled not on political grounds but on merit only.

Referring to the Sindh chief minister, the QAT chief said that Syed Murad Ali Shah was facing severe allegations of corruption and as such he should quit the office of the chief minister.

He said that the GDA also had demanded a special package for Sindh to provide some relief to people who were facing grave problems.

Concern over citizenship, water shortages

The meeting also expressed its severe concern over water shortage in Sindh, power and gas loadshedding and giving citizenship to Bengalis and Afghans in Sindh and called for immediately reviewing the decision.

In response to a question, Sardar Rahim of the PML-F said that the GDA would hold a meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan when he would be visiting Ghotki on the invitation of Sardar Ali Gohar Mahar.

He said that falling rupee value and rising dollar rate, increasing imports and reducing exports of Pakistan manifested severe economic crisis in the country.

Dr Arbab Rahim said that the accountability process ought to continue without any exigency and obstacle.

335,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456288/atc-dismisses-application-to-examine-jit-members-in-perween-rahman-case,"ATC dismisses application to examine JIT members in Perween Rahman case
",2019-01-09,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Monday dismissed an application pleading to examine the members of the Supreme Court-appointed joint investigation teams (JITs), who had detained and grilled the accused allegedly involved in the murder of renowned social activist Perween Rahman.

Ms Rahman, head of the Orangi Pilot Project, was gunned down near her office in Orangi Town on March 13, 2013. Five detained accused — Abdul Raheem Swati, his son Mohammad Imran Swati along with three co-accused Ayaz Shamzai alias Swati, Amjad Hussain Khan and Ahmed Khan alias Ahmed Ali alias Pappu Kashmiri — have been charged with her murder.

On Monday, when the ATC-XIII judge took up the case, the assistant prosecutor general and the counsel for the complainant jointly moved an application under Section 540 (power to summon material witness or examine persons present) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

APG Ghulam Murtaza Maitlo and complainant’s counsel Salahuddin Panhwar contended that at the very initial stage the police high-ups had disclosed in the press conference that the real culprits had been killed in a police encounter upon which the sister of the slain activist had petitioned the Supreme Court to constitute a commission to probe the matter.

They argued that the apex court constituted the commission and JIT to probe the matter, therefore the members of the JIT were material witnesses in the present case and also cited the judgments passed by the superior courts in this regard.

The prosecutor and the defence counsel said that the accused would not be prejudiced if their application was allowed.

On the other hand, Advocates Shah Imroze Khan, Amir Mansoob Qureshi, Abid Zaman and Ajab Khan Khattak, who represented the accused, opposed the plea arguing that the investigating officer of the case had neither cited that the members of the JIT had been witnesses in the charge sheet nor had recorded their statement under Section 161 of the CrPC during the investigation.

They pointed out that neither the report, under Section 173 of the CrPC, and the JIT’s findings were supplied to the accused before the commencement of the trial, adding that nor the same were admissible evidence as had been held by the superior courts.

The defence counsel added that the matter pertained to the year 2013 and had not yet been finalised due to the act of the counsel for the complainant.

The accused are behind bars since the date of their arrest and now the matter is near its end as all the material prosecution witnesses have been examined in the case, but instead of closing the side of the prosecution the APG had filed the present application only to prolong the matter without any reasonable ground.

The judge, dismissing the application, questioned that if the evidence of members of the JIT was so necessary, as stated by the APG for the state, then why the prosecution failed to associate them as witnesses in the calendar of the witnesses in the case.

He observed that the charge sheet and the investigation report under Section 173 of the CrPC were submitted by the police after thorough scrutiny by the prosecutor, who was responsible for seeing whether it was complete or incomplete, other necessary papers were attached, and after fulfilling all the legal formalities required by the court.

“The law does not permit the court to fill up the lacunas in the prosecution case,” the judge wrote in his order.

He further wrote that the present case pertained to 2013 and could not be finalised due to the above act of the counsel for the parties, adding that now there were directives of the Sindh High Court to finalise the matter within two months and the stipulated time was about to end.

",2019-01-09,"KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly is set to hold its first session of the current year on Wednesday (today) amid a demand by the leader of the opposition that the chairman of the provincial public accounts committee (PAC) be appointed from its ranks.

Sindh Governor Imran Ismail convened the first winter session of the Sindh Assembly at 3pm.

The order of the day, as shared by the assembly’s secretariat with the media, offers a heavy agenda that also includes announcement of panel of four chairmen and Question Hour.

CM asked to give PAC chairmanship to opposition

Besides, there is a privilege motion filed by Karim Bux Gabol and an adjournment motion notice by PPP’s Nida Khuhro complaining about the federal government not giving priority to the National Finance Commission Award.

The introduction of the Sindh Zakat and Ushr (Amendment) Bill, 2018 and presentation/consideration of the report of a select committee on the Sindh Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases Bill, 2018, are also part of the day’s agenda.

Officials in the legislature, however, said the session could be postponed for a day after offering fateha on the demise of Mohammad Wajahat, an MPA belonging to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, who died six weeks ago.

PAC chairmanship

Opposition Leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi has asked the government to make a member from the opposition benches as the chairman of the PAC in addition to nine other standing committees.

Mr Naqvi sent a letter to Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday stating: “Keeping [with] the spirit of democracy, the chairmanship of PAC [should] also be given to the opposition.”

He claimed it was agreed earlier between the government and the opposition that chairmen of eight standing committees of the assembly would be nominated from the opposition on latter’s own choice.

He said he had sent a letter vis-à-vis the issue to the chief minister in October in which the opposition had suggested the committees it had chosen to head.

Apart from those eight committees, Mr Naqvi also demanded that the government should also pick opposition members to head the PAC and the Rules of Procedure and Privilege Committee.

“We hope that for the better working and improved efficiency of the assembly, you [CM Shah] would announce the [formation of] standing committees prior to the assembly session on Wednesday,” he concluded.

",2019-01-09,"KARACHI: A day after seasoned politician Dr Farooq Sattar announced his plan to bring all splinter groups to one platform, his rivals in the Bahadurabad group of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan on Tuesday warned him that “criminal or civil” action would be taken against him if he did not stop using the MQM-P name, its flag and election symbol.

A letter issued in this regard by convener of the MQM-P’s coordination committee Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui identified Dr Sattar as the head of the Organisation Restoration Committee — a body he formed in October last to “reorganise the party on ideological lines as it was in 1986”.

While the MQM-P expelled its former convener in November 2018, its letter stated that Dr Sattar’s basic membership was terminated by the coordination committee on Sept 13, 2018.

It stated that despite expulsion he had been employing MQM-P’s name, its flag and symbol “for own self-use, which is unauthorised, mala fide and unlawful, amounting to piracy and misuse”.

“You are hereby warned not to repeat your mala fide act as aforesaid, as in none of your media or other appearances you should be seen to hoist the MQM Pakistan party flag and its symbol ie kite in your vicinity,” the letter said, adding: “None of your banners may also be used or reflect the MQM Pakistan party name or its abbreviation, or exhibit the party flag or its symbol, in any manner whatsoever.”

The letter warned Dr Sattar that if he did not desist “we shall be left with no other option but to report you to the authorities and/or take suitable legal action (criminal or civil) against you”.

On Monday, Dr Sattar announced his intentions of setting up the Muttahida Qaumi Council (MQC) and said that he would contact Pak Sarzameen Party leaders Mustafa Kamal, Anis Kaimkhani, Mohajir Qaumi Movement-Haqiqi chairman Afaq Ahmed and others in an attempt to unite all those who were previously part of the MQM.

338,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456294/creation-of-new-ministries-by-federal-govt-questioned,"Creation of new ministries by federal govt questioned
",2019-01-09,"KARACHI: Questioning the unnecessary creation of new ministries at the federal level, renowned economist Dr Kaiser Bengali on Tuesday urged the federal government to lessen its expenditures if it did not have money.

He was speaking during a consultative dialogue on ‘The 18th Amendment — Crucial for Democracy’ organised by the Women’s Action Forum’s (WAF) Karachi and Hyderabad wings at the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi on Tuesday.

“There are so many ministries formed by the federal government, which are not even needed. For instance, there is the ministry of national harmony. Does it come up with such ministries to give jobs to bureaucrats?” he asked.

The 18th Amendment gives provinces ‘some’ freedom

Coming to the 18th Amendment itself, he said that earlier the provinces used to look towards Islamabad for little things but the 18th Amendment gave the provinces some freedom.

According to it, a province with resources was given priority of using them such as oil and gas and the surplus may be directed to the rest of the country for use. “But the federal government gave away so many gas licences without even consulting the provinces of origin,” he said.

‘Federal govt planning to roll back everything’

Earlier, educationist Dr Arfana Mallah, who was moderating the dialogue, set the ball rolling by talking about provincial autonomy and how the provinces have struggled for devolution all these years. “And now that there is the 18th Amendment in the Constitution, there is the federal government planning to roll back everything,” she said.

Speaking about the 18th Amendment and division of powers, Barrister Zamir Ghumro said that the division of powers scheme is provided under Articles 142, 97 and 154 of the Constitution.

He said that for the first time in history, the federal list was divided in two parts. “Part 1 was entrusted to the federal cabinet and Part 2 to the Council of Common Interests (CCI). Both the federal cabinet and CCI answer to parliament. The permanent secretariat of the CCI has not been established as provided by Article 154 despite the resolution of the Senate,” he said.

“Division of powers between the federal cabinet and CCI stands fundamentally violated,” he pointed out.

He said that division of power scheme between the provinces and the federal government should be respected as should the separation of powers regime between parliament and judiciary.

“Article 248 gives immunity to the cabinet which should be respected. And Article 63(2) and 64 is to empower the parliament and provincial assemblies to remove their members without interference from any other organ of the state which must also be respected,” he said.

Call to shield 18th Amendment

Journalist Nazish Brohi spoke on the process of the 18th Amendment. “It took 60 years for Pakistan to resolve the issue of devolution of power to the provinces and we are rethinking it already,” she said.

“It is not a provincial or federal issue. It has more to do with having a homogeneous country or a country with diversity. So the tension is on the two concepts of Pakistan,” she said, adding: “As citizens and as democrats we should shield the 18th Amendment and demand more.”

Speaking about the education devolution according to the 18th Amendment, Dr Riaz Sheikh, dean of social sciences at SZABIST, said that the 18th Amendment had revised the existing framework of distribution of powers between the federal government and the federating units.

“Education has been shifted to the legislative and executive jurisdiction of the provinces,” he said.

He also said that there are two kinds of federations in the world, hold-together and come-together. “We need to make a move from holding the provinces together to persuading them to come together and the 18th Amendment provides an excellent opportunity for such a paradigm shift,” he said.

Pakistan Peoples Party’s information secretary Dr Nafisa Shah finally said that the dialogue sounded more of a plea to her than a dispassionate debate.

“Because for a debate on the subject the federal perspective was needed too,” she said, adding that the 25th Constitutional Amendment — regarding merger of Fata with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — had positive stories about the strengthening of democracy.

“So there also needs to be a debate about what the other side wants and about its concerns. Also there are different perspectives of the different provinces. All have their separate issues that also need to be considered,” she said.

",2019-01-09,"KARACHI: Mega projects of Karachi Port Trust (KPT) have been submitted for possible inclusion in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative, official sources said on Tuesday.

Secretary Maritime Affairs Amir Khawaja, who recently attended the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) meeting in China, has tabled some of the mega projects of Karachi Port for inclusion in CPEC, sources said.

A Ministry of Maritime Affairs official, talking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity, said that major projects put before the JCC meeting included multi-billion freight corridor from KPT to Port Qasim for onward movement to upcountry of cargo and Special Economic Zone (SEZ) on the backwaters of Karachi port.

Mega projects on freight corridor, SEZ submitted for consideration to JCC

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, who was also part of the Pakistani delegation to the JCC meeting, has supported this incorporation, the same source said. In the second phase, these projects would be taken up for approval by the relevant Joint Working Group in their meeting to be held in March.

The officials hope that the inclusion of freight corridor project under the CPEC umbrella will help Karachi Port which has been struggling to get connectivity for Pakistan Deep Water Container Port at Keamari.

Presently most of the port traffic passes through the city, aggravating traffic congestion. Failure to build road connectivity between the giant port and its own hinterland is the hurdle standing in the way of growing traffic volumes there. The proposal to place the freight corridor before the JCC meeting for inclusion under CPEC is the latest attempt to crack this conundrum.

A freight corridor stretching 40-50km from KPT to Port Qasim is envisioned to have rail, road and oil pipeline connectivity along with LNG terminal and power plant.

Similarly, an SEZ adjacent to the port is ideally located for export oriented industry and Chinese had been always keen to keep such industry close to port areas, sources said.

The Karachi Port has already earmarked an area of around 2,000 acres (to be reclaimed) at the backwaters of the port.

The other project, Khawaja proposed to be included in CPEC, is related to internally connecting both East and West wharves of KPT in order to keep the movement of heavy vehicles within port area.

Connectivity has been a big problem for the deep water terminal ever since it was inaugurated. In 2005, KPT envisioned a harbour crossing bridge to connect the port directly to the Northern Bypass for transport link for up country traffic. But at an estimated cost of $1 billion, that plan proved prohibitively expensive.

In this regard Plan B was an elevated expressway to run from Keamari to the Northern Bypass, over Jinnah bridge, which had an estimated price tag of $500mn. Even that plan failed to materialize due to lack of funds.

",2019-01-09,"ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee has proposed giving a boost to construction activities in Gwadar, especially construction of houses, so that businesses in the port city could flourish.

The Senate Committee on Maritime Affairs made the recommendation during a meeting on Tuesday after Senator Shamim Afridi complained about poor housing facilities in Gwadar.

Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) chairman Dostain Khan Jamaldini also agreed with the committee’s suggestion, saying that construction activities should be allowed in those zones in the port city which have been cleared in the master plan to meet accommodation requirements.

He briefed the Senate committee on hurdles in the way of the port city’s development and steps being taken to remove them.

Mr Jamaldini informed the committee that a railway network was still missing in the city, besides there was a shortage of skilled workforce.

“Besides tax incentives the Gwadar port needs subsides like those offered to Port Qasim for 15 years. These steps are important at a time when Saudi Arabia is showing interest to invest in Gwadar,” he said.

During his presentation, the GPA chairman responded to queries and complaints by the committee members.

Some members complained that while development of Gwadar was being planned, interests of local fishermen had not been taken under consideration.

Mr Jamaldini replied that a new fishery was being developed in Gwadar. He said that space had been allocated for residential areas for local people of the city.

Some members of the committee were of the view that a false impression was created about business opportunities in Gwadar through advertisements during the tenure of former president retired Gen Pervez Musharraf. They said the move attracted a large number of investors who purchased land in the port city from local people at throwaway prices.

Senator Mohammad Akram of the National Party claimed that local fishermen were still being dislocated in Gwadar.

Senator Rana Mahmoodul Hassan lamented the downgrading of the fishing industry in the country.

Senator Kauda Babar said a sub-committee was formed by the chairperson of the main committee, Nuzhar Sadiq of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. The sub-committee, he added, prepared a report about Gwadar’s problems.

The chairperson gave the Ministry of Maritime Affairs a month for its feedback on the report prepared by the sub-committee.

",2019-01-09,"QUETTA: The Balochistan cabinet reviewed the Public Sector Development Programme 2018-19 and took various decisions about work on ongoing development projects and release of funds and sought the list of the old projects under investigation and those which could not have been completed over the last 10 years.

A meeting of the cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani and attended by the secretaries of different departments, discussed suggestions to decide how to release funds for the ongoing development projects. It was decided that the planning and development department would give final shape to new development schemes.

It was also decided that the sub-committee of the cabinet on the PSDP would review the slashed schemes.

The cabinet directed the sub-committee to submit the list of those schemes which were under investigation and others which could not have been executed or completed over the last 10 years, in the next cabinet meeting.

The chief minister said that the provincial cabinet and bureaucracy needed to jointly work as a team and each member of this team should fulfil his responsibilities,

“All departments have been given power to run their administrative affairs and they will be held accountable if any negligence was found in their performance,” Mr Alyani said.

The cabinet approved suspending of the funds for under-investigation development schemes. As per another decision of the cabinet, 245 on-going schemes will be presented to the sub-committee of the cabinet to decide whether they should be continued or suspended.

The cabinet directed all the departments to submit the layout and PC-1 of new development schemes to the finance and planning and development department before the cabinet presented the schemes in the Provincial Assembly for final approval.

The cabinet directed the planning and development department to exclude the Pat Feeder Canal Project and some other projects from the PSDP and include these projects in a separate list.

The cabinet also approved direct release of funds for various development projects to expedite work on them on temporary basis, and continue the practice on permanent basis if it yields positive results.

“Without any hesitation the provincial government would take strict action against week performers while competent officers would be rewarded because the government seeks to build a positive image through good governance and development of Balochistan,” Mr Alyani said. “We can’t tolerate compromise on the provincial government’s performance,” he added.

The cabinet also directed the planning and development department to start preparing development programme for 2019-20 and instructed all departments to fix timeframe of their development projects.

",2019-01-09,"LAHORE: Turkey’s Maarif Foundation on Tuesday formally assumed the management of all educational institutions in Pakistan previously linked to Fethullah Gulen’s organisation.

There are 28 Pak-Turk schools in different cities. Schools in Karachi and Islamabad were handed over to the foundation on Friday and those in Lahore on Tuesday.

Take a look: On the mysterious deportations of Turkish teachers

The Supreme Court had earlier instructed the government to declare Gulen’s organisation a terrorist group and ordered handing over of the schools to the Maarif Foundation.

Turkey had established the Maarif Foundation in 2016 after a coup attempt. It was tasked with taking over the administration of overseas schools linked to Gulen’s organisation. It also establishes schools and educational centres internationally.

The Pak-Turk schools were administered by a foundation linked to Gulen, once an ally of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. However, since the abortive coup attempt in 2016, the Turkish leadership has blamed Gulen for sponsoring the overthrow attempt, resulting in a global crackdown on the religious and educational network led by him.

Ankara accuses Gulen of being behind a long-running campaign to overthrow the state through the infiltration of Turkish institutions, particularly the military, police and judiciary.

However, the students of Pak-Turk schools and their parents had protested against the government for handing over their teachers to Turkey and later the schools to the foundation.

Maarif Foundation president Prof Dr Birol Akgün said in a statement that his organisation was taking over schools, institutions and facilities in several countries linked to Gulen through bilateral and multilateral agreements on behalf of the Republic of Turkey.

Ms Maryam inquired after the health of her father and asked him whether he was given proper medical care or not during a half-an-hour meeting.

Mr Sharif reportedly had flu and fever. According to a source, jail doctors examined the former prime minister and provided him treatment.

A PML-N leader said that Mr Sharif had requested the jail authorities to allow his personal physician to see him, but his request had not yet been entertained.

Mr Sharif had undergone open-heart surgery about three years ago in London.

During her last Thursday’s visit, Ms Maryam had tweeted: “Just came out of Kot lakhpat jail. MNS (Mian Nawaz Sharif) was fine and Alhamdolillah in high spirits. Thank you everyone for your prayers, unflinching support & good wishes. God bless you all.”

Mr Sharif was taken to Adiala jail after he was sentenced to seven years in prison in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills case on Dec 25 by an accountability court in Islamabad. He was later shifted to Kot Lakhpat jail on his own request.

The former prime minister was fined Rs1.5 billion and $25 million. The court also barred him from holding a public office for 10 years after completion of the sentence.

",2019-01-09,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday requested the Islamabad High Court for early hearing of the appeal against his conviction in the Al-Azizia/Hill Metal Establishment reference.

A division bench of the IHC comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani will hear Mr Sharif’s appeal.

Barrister Munawwar Duggal has filed an application seeking immediate hearing of the appeal against the verdict announced by an accountability court in the reference on Dec 24, 2018.

In the application, the defence counsel pointed out that the winter vacation had ended and, therefore, the appeal against the conviction might be fixed before the available bench.

It may be mentioned that during the vacation, the IHC heard only important and urgent cases that included bail, habeas corpus and other matters related to fundamental rights.

Another IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Aamer Farooq had on Monday taken up Mr Sharif’s petition seeking suspension of his sentence.

The bench, however, pointed out that since the appeal against the conviction in the Al-Azizia-Hill Metal Establishment had neither been fixed nor taken up, the petition for suspension of the sentence could not be entertained at this stage.

The bench reserved the order of the day after a preliminary hearing of the petition seeking suspension of the sentence.

The court, however, released the order on Tuesday deciding to take up the petition after the appeal against the conviction would be admitted for regular hearing.

Accountability court judge Mohammad Arshad Malik had on Dec 24 convicted Mr Sharif in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills Company (ASCL) and Hill Metal Establishment (HME) reference and awarded him seven years imprisonment and fined him Rs1.5 billion and $25 million.

Mr Sharif filed the appeal through his lead counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed who pointed out certain ‘extraneous’ factors which accountability judges never consider while imparting judgements in routine cases.

The judge, however, acquitted Mr Sharif in the reference pertaining to Flagship and other UK-based companies owned by his son Hassan Nawaz. As per the charge sheet, the former premier has allegedly “injected an amount of GBP3.2 million” in Flagship Investment Ltd and other companies.

The charge sheet accused Mr Sharif of accumulating these assets in the names of his children.

The National Accountability Bureau, on the other hand, has challenged the acquittal of Nawaz Sharif in the Flagship Investment reference and also requested the IHC to enhance his jail term from seven to 14 years.

",2019-01-09,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), hearing a complaint against Justice Muhammad Farrukh Irfan Khan of the Lahore High Court on Tuesday, refused to summon former chief justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry as a witness.

A request was made by senior counsel Hamid Khan, who is defending the sitting judge, to call the former chief justice to testify the affidavit he had filed before the five-judge SJC.

The reference was filed against Justice Khan when his name surfaced in the list of the people having offshore properties abroad. He was also accused of indulging in money laundering and issued a show-cause notice by the council in February 2017.

Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, who heads the council, rejected the plea raised by the counsel by saying that the SJC would not summon retired judges, but the counsel could ask his witness to appear before the forum on his own.

Reference involves LHC judge who is accused of owning offshore companies, money laundering

In his affidavit, Justice Chaudhry has defended Justice Khan by saying that he did not receive any complaint against him from any person, bar, judge or the chief justice of the Lahore High Court during his tenure as the chief justice of Pakistan, and that the sitting judge was not short-tempered or disrespectful to lawyers, litigants or government officials.

On the contrary, the former CJP said, during his tenure as judge of the high court, Justice Khan conducted himself with the highest dignity and his elevation and working as a judge added to the respect and decorum of the institution.

Justice Khan, he said, had a good reputation among his brother judges, lawyers and litigants as an upright, honest, hard-working and dedicated judge.

Justice Chaudhry has contended that he nominated and elevated Justice Khan due to his vast legal and international experience and also because he was an honest and upright citizen. Moreover, Justice Khan was a successful lawyer both in Pakistan and at international forums.

The former CJP said that Justice Khan told him about his practice in the United Arab Emirates and fact of owning properties and that he was working in the boards of different charitable organisations before his elevation.

On his request, Justice Chaudhry recalled, Justice Khan joined the judiciary and started the process of disassociating himself from all other engagements and family businesses.

Testifying on Tuesday, advocate Shehzad Shaukat, who knows Justice Khan since childhood and studied with him in the same secondary school and Punjab University Law College, Lahore, said that Nazar Mohammad Chauhan — the complainant — also studied in the same school.

Mr Shaukat said the allegations levelled by the complainant were misconceived and not worth the paper they were written on. He contended that the complainant had been removed from the civil service and that he “defames Pakistan, its judiciary and its people through his internet blogs”.

The lawyer said that he was familiar with the fact that the family of Justice Khan was one of the leading business families of Pakistan and that his brothers and cousins were successful business people.

The lawyers of the country respected Justice Khan earlier as a thorough professional lawyer and now as a knowledgeable, bold, pleasant and upright high court judge, he added.

The SJC will resume the proceedings on Wednesday again.

",2019-01-09,"PESHAWAR: A 20-member delegation from China visited the Peshawar Museum and historical sites here on Tuesday.

Members of the delegation took considerable interest in the findings and discoveries relating to Gandhara civilisation and praised the directorate of archaeology and museums of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for its efforts to protect Buddhist artefacts as well as sites.

The general manager of the Tourist Information Centres, Mohammad Ali Syed, welcomed the Chinese guests.

Curator Mohammad Asif briefed the delegation on the archaeological sites in Pesha­war, said a press release issued by the Tourism Corpora­tion of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The officials expressed the hope that the visit would provide an opportunity to the Chinese guests to share their experiences and know­ledge with archaeologists and researchers which could be beneficial for excavations on archaeological sites and historical buildings.

The Chinese delegation also visited the historical Masjid-i-Mahabat Khan, Qis­sa Khawani Bazaar, Sarafa Bazaar (Andar Shehr), Ghanta Ghar, Chowk Yadgar and other sites of interest in the city.

Terming Peshawar a historic and safe city, the foreign visitors said the people of the city and other parts of KP were hospitable and friendly.

The officials informed the visitors that there were over 6,000 archaeological and heritage sites in KP where research was being carried out.

“The followers of Buddhism would find a treasure trove of Buddhist statues and heritage after thorough research and revival of these sites,” they said.

Mr Syed said the visit of foreign dignitaries was meant to highlight the importance of heritage and archaeological sites related to Buddhism in KP, besides promoting religious tourism in the province.

He said the government had taken a number of steps for attracting foreign tourists, scholars and researchers to the province. The official said a comprehensive policy had been evolved for preserving and protecting the archaeological sites and places.

He said that initiatives were being taken to carry out excavation on archaeological sites with modern techniques and methods.

",2019-01-09,"ISLAMABAD: Extending another olive branch to arch-rival India, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday congratulated the Indian cricket side on becoming the first team of the subcontinent to have won a Test series against Australia on their home ground.

In his tweet, the prime minister also acknowledged the unprecedented achievement of Indian captain Virat Kohli and his team.

The fourth and final Test match between India and Australia ended in a draw on Jan 6. Indian team’s 2-1 lead was unprecedented as no Asian team had ever defeated Aussies in their own land.

“Congratulations to Virat Kohli and the Indian cricket team for the first-ever win by any subcontinent team in a Test series in Australia,” Prime Minister Khan tweeted.

In his first address to the nation after assuming charge of his office in August last year, the prime minister had urged India “to take one step forward, Pakistan will take two”. The opening of the Kartarpur corridor to facilitate Sikh pilgrims is also said to be one of the measures taken by Pakistan to restore relations with India.

Prime Minister Khan had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September last year a letter suggesting that the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. However, India had cancelled the meeting within a day of approving the plan. The cancellation had been accompanied by a strong statement from India, which was followed by a trenchant response from Pakistan.

On India’s response, Prime Minister Khan said: “I had such a bad response…it really surprised me that why would anyone be scared of dialogue? Then there are pre-conditions put on such dialogues…. It is almost as if there is no intention for peace.”

In a recent interview to Turkey’s news channel TRT World, Mr Khan said India was involved in committing human rights violations in held Kashmir, but it would never succeed in suppressing the freedom movement of Kashmiris.

He said Pakistan wanted to hold dialogue with India, but New Delhi has refused Islamabad’s offer several times. “Pakistan will wait for the 2019 general elections in India to be over for its current outreach to get a positive response from New Delhi,” he added.

Meeting with WHO, Bill Gates Foundation officials World Health Organisation (WHO) Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and President of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Development Division Dr Christopher Elias called on Prime Minister Imran Khan at PM Office.

Acting head of WHO Country Office Pakistan Dr Nima Saeed Abid and chief adviser to the WHO director general Dr Senait Fisseha were also present during the meeting.

The Pakistani side included Minister for Health Aamer Mehmood Kiani, PM’s focal person on polio eradication Babar Bin Atta, Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua, Health Secretary retired Captain Zahid Saeed and other senior officials.

Dr Adhanom said WHO had increased its focus on public health, country-level impacts and bringing improvements in people’s access to health-related knowledge and information.

He informed the prime minister about WHO’s ongoing programmes/projects in Pakistan. The organisation has considerably increased level of support in Pakistan, mainly due to intensified activities of polio-eradication initiatives.

The prime minister welcomed the WHO director general and his delegation to Pakistan and said the country attached importance to WHO. Pakistan appreciated the role of WHO in the health care system, he added.

“The government is determined to implement a transformative social and economic agenda for a ‘New Pakistan’,” he said. He reiterated his government’s commitment to moving forward the sustainable development agenda.

The Prime Minister Khan said the government continued to tackle polio eradication as a national public health emergency, adding that polio vaccination activities were well organised in close collaboration with the provinces and were directly overseen by the national, provincial and divisional task forces.

Dr Christopher Elias delivered a letter from Mr Bill Gates to Prime Minister Khan.

Mohammad Umer Daudzai conveyed President Ashraf Ghani's greetings to the Pakistani leadership and expressed Afghanistan's ""strong desire to work closely with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest"", a statement issued by the Foreign Office said.

The special envoy also relayed ""deep appreciation of the sincerity and vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan for peace and stability in Pakistan"", the press release added.

Daudzai acknowledged that the fact that Qureshi visited Kabul thrice within a span of four months was ""a clear proof of Pakistan's strong support for Afghanistan"".

During his visit, the envoy briefed the foreign minister on the nature of his position which entails that he ""help create harmony among the various stakeholders"".

The foreign minister welcomed Daudzai and assured him of Pakistan's commitment to peace in the region. He said stability in Afghanistan was in Pakistan's own national interest, and necessary for economic development and prosperity in the region.

Qureshi highlighted the growing global view that the suffering of the Afghan people needs to be brought to an end through a peaceful resolution of the conflict. He assured the envoy that Pakistan ""would do all to help the people of Afghanistan see the earliest possible end to bloodshed and enter a new phase of peace and prosperity"".

The Afghan special envoy noted that the two countries had a ""unique relationship marked by commonalities and similarity of interests"". He stressed that the relationship needed to be utilised to its fullest through various bilateral cooperation mechanisms.

He communicated the Afghan government's strong desire to take maximum advantage of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS) in all areas of cooperation.

Daudzai noted that ""enhancing bilateral trade and economic activities and more regular cultural and people-to-people contacts was the need of the hour"", according to the FO statement.

To this end, both sides agreed to regularly exchange high-level visits and recognised that the ""brotherly feelings between the two people"" owing to historical bonds must be harnessed to usher in a new era in Pak-Afghan relations.

The first US-Taliban talks facilitated by Pakistan were held last month in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in which United States diplomats and Taliban representatives met with the aim of finding a negotiated settlement of the war in Afghanistan.

The meeting in Abu Dhabi was also attended by officials from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

This month's talks, the fourth in a series aimed at ending the 17-year war in Afghanistan, are scheduled between Taliban leaders and US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to discuss the withdrawal of foreign forces and a possible ceasefire in 2019.

",2019-01-08,"An antiterrorism court (ATC) in Karachi has dismissed a request made by the sister of Perween Rahman to summon the members of the three Supreme Court-appointed Joint Investigation Teams (JITs), which had detained and grilled the accused persons allegedly involved in the murder of the renowned social activist, it was learnt on Tuesday.

Five accused — Abdul Raheem Swati, his son Mohammad Imran Swati, and three co-accused: Ayaz Shamzai alias Swati, Amjad Hussain Khan, and Ahmed Khan alias Ahmed Ali alias Pappu Kashmiri — have been charged with her murder.

Rahman, head of the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) who devoted her life to the development of the impoverished neighbourhoods across the country, was gunned down near her office in Orangi Town on March 13, 2013.

Advocate Salahuddin Panhwar, who represented the slain activist's sister, had moved an application before the judge of the ATC-XIII on Monday, contending that at the very initial stage of the case, police high-ups had disclosed at a press conference that the real culprits behind the murder of Rahman had been killed in a ‘police encounter’.

Therefore, the activist's sister approached the Supreme Court for the constitution of a commission to probe the case, Panhwar said, adding that later on, the apex court constituted the three JITs. The counsel asserted that the JIT members were important witnesses in the case at hand and requested that they may be summoned to testify before the court.

The defence counsel for the accused men opposed the request by Rahman's sister, arguing that the investigating officer of the case had neither cited the members of the JITs as witnesses in the charge sheet nor recorded their statements under Section 161 of the criminal procedure code during the investigation. Therefore, the counsel asked the ATC to reject the application seeking to summon the members of the JITs.

After hearing arguments from the defence and prosecution sides and the complainant’s counsel, the judge dismissed the application, observing that the plea had been filed at a belated stage only to prolong the case without any justification.

The trial court has already declared two absconding suspects — Noor Muhammad and Ehsanuddin — as proclaimed offenders and separated their cases from the trial of the five detained accused persons.

According to the prosecution, some of the detained accused during interrogation had confessed to their involvement in the crime and disclosed that local leaders of the Awami National Party (ANP) had allegedly hired Taliban militants to kill Rahman.

It added that Ayaz and Raheem, who were said to be local leaders of the ANP, were living near the OPP office and allegedly tried to obtain a designated area to build a karate centre, but Rahman refused to allow it.

The prosecution further said that all the accused persons were present in a meeting held in January 2013 at Raheem's residence in which they planned Rahman's assassination, adding that they hired a local commander of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Moosa, and Mehfoozullah alias Bhaloo to kill the OPP head.

",2019-01-08,"Firdous Shamim Naqvi, the Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly, on Tuesday urged Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to fulfil his party's promise of giving to the opposition the chairmanships of eight standing committees, including that of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) by the next session.

The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader, in a letter addressed to the chief minister, reminded him that PPP leaders ""had agreed that eight committee chairmanships will be given to the opposition"".

Naqvi put forth the demand that ""keeping with the spirit of democracy, the chairmanship of PAC"" and Rules of Procedure and Privilege Committee should go to the opposition.

""We hope that for the better working of the legislative and improved efficiency of the parliamentary assembly you would announce the standing committee prior to the assembly session on Wednesday,"" he added.

Prior to submitting the letter, an important meeting of the opposition parties — including parliamentary leaders of PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) — was held in the Sindh Assembly, with Naqvi at the helm.

During the meeting, it was observed that the National Assembly had appointed its PAC chairman, but in Sindh, the provincial government had still not done so.

It was agreed that the issue of the PAC chairmanship would be raised during the next Sindh Assembly session on Wednesday and if PPP does not immediately appoint the chairman, the opposition would boycott the session.

Naqvi wrote a second letter to the speaker of the Sindh Assembly, informing him that ""the opposition had already proposed the names from the opposition benches"" for the Business Advisory Committee but that ""the treasury has yet to confirm their members from their side.""

The opposition leader said ""it would be appreciated if this committee [is] announced before the session starting Wednesday, 9 Jan 2019.""

",2019-01-08,"Evictions and displacements not only marginalise poor populations but also further impoverish them.

Hidden within the narrow lanes of Moosa Colony, in UC-35 of North Nazimabad, Karachi, one can find the material ruins of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR), faintly discernible in the sand-covered tracks and a few isolated posts bearing numeric markings.

The KCR’s golden era of the 1960s can be traced in Moosa Colony’s residents’ accounts; an era when the KCR represented a vanguard of modernity and embodied high aspirations for Karachi's landscape of mobility.

While operational inefficiencies eventually led to the KCR’s demise in the 1990s, with passenger traffic coming to a halt in December 1999, a plan is currently underway to revive it.

Although the KCR’s rebirth was considered as early as 2008, the project is now being fast-tracked under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and is aligned with the present government’s aspirations of building a Naya Pakistan; a collective nostalgia for the nation, with the KCR providing a renewed hope for a different future.

Planners estimate that over half a million passengers will be facilitated daily by the revival of the project, but this step to resuscitate the KCR is not only an attempt to modernise the city’s current transportation network, it also seeks to commemorate visions of Karachi as a ‘world class’ city.

While the KCR’s revival is being celebrated in public discourse for the broader good of the city and is itself associated with ‘progress’, the 28 informal settlements with nearly 45,000 people who have lived for 20 or more years along the KCR route, hold an ambiguous position in Karachi's consciousness.

Between the promise of modernisation set out in the revival plan and a set of complex circumstances resulting from the city’s demographic, economic and social transformations of the past two decades, the KCR’s architectural and infrastructural ruins exist alongside the residents’ material and social aspirations for upward mobility and new futures that pivot ultimately on the question of land ownership.

Houses built along the railway tracks in Umar Colony 1.

Land, durability and home

The process of land acquisition at the time of Partition was considerably different from what it is today. The influx of over 600,000 refugees in Karachi in 1947 meant that many had to find shelter on a self-help basis as the new government had failed to respond to the rising housing demand.

While the city limits were restricted to Jamshed Quarters, the resettling populations demarcated their territory in the land that was available to the north and west of Karachi.

Today, the third generations of those refugees reside in the neighbourhoods of the KCR along with migrants from other parts of the country, and they collectively claim ownership of the land in the 28 settlements.

Pakistan’s urban policy: Turning cities into slums

These ethnically heterogeneous neighbourhoods have expanded considerably over the past 50 years, and that too on land that has become a matter of dispute between them and Pakistan Railways.

Over the past several decades, the architectural language of the houses situated along the KCR route has evolved considerably.

Initially, the houses existed as temporary shelters, with tents and huts made of fabric or canvas for enclosure, supported by bamboo posts or timber with roofs of thatch and straw. These raw materials were readily available at that time to enable auto-construction.

From huts to sheds to mini villas: the material transformation of the KCR neighbourhoods.

Gradually, the homeowners shifted towards using hard materials such as concrete for construction to ensure durability and permanence.

This was not merely a step towards achieving a ‘modern’ appearance or living standards, but also an assurance of right of possession — to reduce the risk of expulsion, or at least to make the task considerably harder for local authorities if eviction became inevitable.

The readily available cement-concrete block, metal sheet roofs for single-storey construction and T-girder roof with concrete floor for vertical construction, are materials that have literally sutured in place the identity and aspirations of the KCR neighbourhoods.

Hence, the development process of these neighbourhoods cannot be regarded as simply spontaneous. Rather, it has been a conscious effort that has materialised through purposeful changes to the built environment.

Residents' aspirations

The term katchi abadi is used frequently to describe the KCR neighbourhoods and this is misleading in the current context.

The neighbourhoods or abadis are as pakka and permanent as any other neighbourhood in Karachi and the residents’ lives are deeply integrated with the built environment.

For the residents whose houses are situated in proximity to the tracks, they have become accustomed to the traffic of cargo trains, observing the movements as an inseparable part of the neighbourhood’s physical landscape.

Any activity that takes place on the tracks slowly disperses as the vibrations of the steel beams are sensed for an oncoming train; a signal that everyone is familiar with. For the children, the tracks are a ‘dangerous’ playground given the absence of any other open space.

Tracks passing over the Gujjar Nala in Wahid Colony, Nazimabad.

Certainly, the KCR neighbourhoods are embedded in a complex cultural habitat with livelihood patterns based on historically situated social networks and capital, something that is indispensable to the residents’ way of life.

Whether it is active street life or community spirit, the concept of shared public space for work, domesticity and leisure is best understood in these neighbourhoods as exemplifying the everyday life of the city’s urban majority.

The residents’ familiarity and the relatable human scale of these neighbourhoods also enable new migrants — mostly from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — to find home in an otherwise rapidly expanding and unfamiliar city.

I came across several migrants living in Gharibabad Colony who often stated: ""It feels like I am back in my village,"" and ""I forget we are in the middle of the city.""

Even though a considerable number of working-class and low-income people live in the KCR neighbourhoods, through their struggles they have managed to invest in their children’s education to ensure a better future.

There is an emergent generation of young adults who are receiving professional medical and chartered accountant degrees, with aspirations to find jobs in the private sector.

In my conversations with young men and women, they expressed a desire for upward mobility: better material conditions, bigger houses and improved aesthetics.

All these elements are visible in the evolving architectural patterns of these neighbourhoods, but a barrier to upward mobility is the fear of uncertainty; the impending eviction due to the KCR revival plan that feeds a sense of aversion to further investment in houses that will be demolished soon.

For the residents whose houses are situated along the length of the track that is meant to connect the KCR with the rest of the city — referred to as the loop line — the daily commute over the buried tracks is a reminder of the past and an uncertain future.

For them, what appears as progress for the city and the nation, is in fact a catastrophe, an impending threat of eviction and long-term displacement.

Negotiating uncertainty

In response to an uncertain future due to threat of eviction, residents have devised strategies to mitigate risk. In some houses, a segment located at the front of the concrete dwelling is constructed from materials that can be easily taken apart.

Residents explained that if there is an eviction operation, this type of construction material will ensure minimal damage to the owner. This is found primarily in those homes that are situated on the overlapping boundaries of private and public land ownership.

House extensions built from provisional material in Wahid Colony, Nazimabad.

To secure political support, certain neighbourhoods have even been named after patrons from political parties. A case in point is Umar Colony 1 that is named after the son of a prominent Pakistan People's Party politician. Another is Moosa Colony, named after General Musa, who served as commander-in-chief during Ayub Khan’s era.

These toponyms or place names confer a sense of identity and chronicle the history of the diverse KCR settlements, many that will soon be pushed off Karachi’s map.

Development’s violent history

Pakistan's history of development and urban planning is stained by tragic stories of internal displacement, such as after the construction of the Mangla and Tarbela Dams and even the planning of the capital city of Islamabad.

In addition to these and numerous other infrastructure projects, the human rights of ordinary citizens have been continually violated with respect to planning for just compensation and resettlement.

Evictions and displacements not only marginalise poor populations but also further impoverish them.

In Pakistan, the resettlement practices of such projects have seldom seen successful outcomes, with assistance limited to cash compensation only for registered properties and a complete disregard for the irreversible effects on the displaced community.

Projects like the construction of the Lyari Expressway and Bahria Town are replete with stories about communities whose land and homes have been appropriated by the government or private developers.

The consequences for those who are evicted and displaced are extensive; loss of home, livelihood and a sense of belonging; this holds true for the neighbourhoods demolished during the construction of the Lyari Expressway.

The residents were resettled on Karachi’s periphery and onto an unfamiliar terrain where they have had to rebuild lives. The story for the affectees of the KCR may prove to be no different.

KCR and its discontents

In the Global South, violent planning regimes and infrastructure development projects have almost always contributed incalculably to the process of overwriting identities of marginalised communities, consequently obliterating their history together with all traces of their legitimacy and belonging, literally pushing them off the map of the city.

The loss for them is not merely financial; the individual is left socially and institutionally bankrupt and marginalised.

While the benefits of a project like the KCR may be deemed as one that facilitates a much larger population, and resolves the ever-present transport problems of Karachi, the destruction of everyday lives of those affected by its construction will be colossal.

",2019-01-08,"Punjab Information and Culture Minister Fayyazul Hassan Chohan on Tuesday lashed out at journalists for asking a question regarding his stance on comments made by Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Sirajul Haq, who had questioned the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government's efforts to turn Pakistan into an Islamic welfare state.

While talking to reporters after attending an event arranged to honour the late JI leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed in Lahore, Chohan was asked about Haq's claim that the ruling party had not taken any ""step towards building a Madina-like Islamic state"".

The question angered the provincial minister, who criticised the media for being ""inconsiderate"" for asking him about Haq's comments at an event arranged in memory of Hussain, the late JI Emir.

""You should not ask such a question which can create a contradiction, out of respect,"" Chohan told media representatives.

The minister also declared that the media ""should not be out of bounds"".

His statements prompted a protest from journalists, who said that the media has the right to ask questions and the minister could choose not to answer.

They demanded that Chohan retract his statement and surrounded him when he started to leave. The journalists pointed out that Chohan had made political statements himself when he alluded to ""looters"" and ""thieves"" in his media talk.

The provincial minister left without any further statement.

This is not the first time a minister from the ruling PTI has acted brashly with journalists. Last week, Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda lost his cool when Dawn's senior journalist Khaleeq Kiani asked him about the government's decision to award the Rs300 billion Mohmand Dam project on a ""single"" financial bid of a consortium that includes Descon, a company owned by the Prime Minister’s Adviser on Commerce.

""Your party had strongly criticised the LNG deal because it was done on a single-bid basis, and now your government has awarded the contract of Mohmand dam on a single-bid basis. How can you say it is legitimate?"" Kiani had questioned.

Vawda did not take the query kindly, saying: ""I could have expected such a question from Dawn only. I am not responsible for something that happened before my birth... Because you are my elder I am answering this question. If this was someone else, I would not have answered and also set aside the mic.""

At this, the reporters at the press conference objected to his choice of words and started walking out in solidarity with Kiani. Vawda then attempted to placate the media personnel but his efforts were in vain as reporters and cameramen staged a walkout.",Ali Waqar | dawn,"['punjab', 'information', 'culture', 'minister', 'fayyazul', 'hassan', 'chohan', 'tuesday', 'lashed', 'journalists', 'asking', 'question', 'regarding', 'stance', 'comments', 'made', 'jamaatiislami', 'ji', 'chief', 'sirajul', 'haq', 'questioned', 'pakistan', 'tehreekiinsaf', 'pti', 'government', 'efforts', 'turn', 'pakistan', 'islamic', 'welfare', 'state', 'talking', 'reporters', 'attending', 'event', 'arranged', 'honour', 'late', 'ji', 'leader', 'qazi', 'hussain', 'ahmed', 'lahore', 'chohan', 'asked', 'haq', 'claim', 'ruling', 'party', 'taken', 'step', 'towards', 'building', 'madinalike', 'islamic', 'state', 'question', 'angered', 'provincial', 'minister', 'criticised', 'media', 'inconsiderate', 'asking', 'haq', 'comments', 'event', 'arranged', 'memory', 'hussain', 'late', 'ji', 'emir', 'ask', 'question', 'create', 'contradiction', 'respect', 'chohan', 'told', 'media', 'representatives', 'minister', 'also', 'declared', 'media', 'bounds', 'statements', 'prompted', 'protest', 'journalists', 'said', 'media', 'right', 'ask', 'questions', 'minister', 'could', 'choose', 'answer', 'demanded', 'chohan', 'retract', 'statement', 'surrounded', 'started', 'leave', 'journalists', 'pointed', 'chohan', 'made', 'political', 'statements', 'alluded', 'looters', 'thieves', 'media', 'talk', 'provincial', 'minister', 'left', 'without', 'statement', 'first', 'time', 'minister', 'ruling', 'pti', 'acted', 'brashly', 'journalists', 'last', 'week', 'federal', 'minister', 'water', 'resources', 'faisal', 'vawda', 'lost', 'cool', 'dawn', 'senior', 'journalist', 'khaleeq', 'kiani', 'asked', 'government', 'decision', 'award', 'rs300', 'billion', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'project', 'single', 'financial', 'bid', 'consortium', 'includes', 'descon', 'company', 'owned', 'prime', 'minister', 'adviser', 'commerce', 'party', 'strongly', 'criticised', 'lng', 'deal', 'done', 'singlebid', 'basis', 'government', 'awarded', 'contract', 'mohmand', 'dam', 'singlebid', 'basis', 'say', 'legitimate', 'kiani', 'questioned', 'vawda', 'take', 'query', 'kindly', 'saying', 'could', 'expected', 'question', 'dawn', 'responsible', 'something', 'happened', 'birth', 'elder', 'answering', 'question', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'answered', 'also', 'set', 'aside', 'mic', 'reporters', 'press', 'conference', 'objected', 'choice', 'words', 'started', 'walking', 'solidarity', 'kiani', 'vawda', 'attempted', 'placate', 'media', 'personnel', 'efforts', 'vain', 'reporters', 'cameramen', 'staged', 'walkout']","['punjab', 'info', 'minister', 'snaps', 'reporter', 'question', 'creates', 'contradiction']"
353,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456240/sc-assigns-swati-probe-to-fbr-police,"SC assigns Swati probe to FBR, police
",2019-01-08,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday assigned the assets-beyond-means investigation against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Azam Swati to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and Islamabad police.

The court passed the orders while hearing a suo motu case regarding the 'unlawful' transfer of former Islamabad police chief Jan Mohammad.

The police official's transfer took place after Swati’s son had registered a case against a family of slum dwellers for allegedly trespassing on his family’s land. Five people, including two women, were arrested for trespassing on the land and beating up Swati’s guards.

They were released after a day’s detention as police said a settlement had been reached between the minister and the detained family. The altercation, coupled with the IGP's transfer, had caught the attention of the media as well as the apex court.

""We will not end the case against Azam Swati yet,"" Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar said today during the hearing, adding that the court would hear the case again once reports from police and other agencies were submitted.

Addressing the current Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammad Aamir Zulfiqar Khan, the top judge said that he had not yet registered a first information report (FIR) against the senator.

""You are still maintaining your loyalties,"" Justice Nisar said as he directed the police chief to meet him in his chambers.

On November 19, the court-formed joint investigation team (JIT) had held Swati and his employees responsible for the altercation that took place at his farmhouse and allegedly transpired into the police chief's transfer.

""Has the JIT report been thrown in the bin?"" Justice Nisar asked today.

Swati's counsel Ali Zafar apprised the SC bench that his client had already resigned from his post.

""He has only resigned from the ministry,"" said the judge, adding that in the detailed judgement the bench will include their opinion on the matter from the point of view of Article 62(1)(f) ─ the same section that led to the disqualification last year of Nawaz Sharif and Jahangir Tareen.

""Is he eligible to remain a member of parliament now,"" Justice Nisar wondered, noting that Swati's name is still associated with the ministry.

Meanwhile, IGP Zulfiqar briefed the court on measures taken by his department, saying that a 'challan' has been filed against Swati's son Usman as well as Najeebullah Khan Muhammad, Faiz Mahmood and Jahanzeb.

""Nothing was done against the person who manages the affairs,"" Justice Nisar said. ""Is it because he is a bigwig?""

He said that if the police chief did not want to provide justice to the people, ""what are you the inspector general for?""

""The JIT report said that police made a special deal with the minister,"" he said. ""My impression of you has been ruined. ""I'm trying to strengthen you, but you keep falling short.""

Amicus curiae Faisal Siddiqui said that according to the JIT, Swati had no role in the former IGP's transfer but noted that the transfer was done the same day that he had failed to answer his phone.

Siddiqui, however, said that as per the JIT, Swati had provided misinformation about two of his assets. At this, the chief justice asked if there was any forum apart from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) where the matter could be sent.

Siddiqui said that action could be taken against the former minister through criminal law while disqualification proceedings could also be taken for concealing assets.

""One man is not 'sadiq' (truthful) and 'ameen' (righteous) so how can he be a member of parliament?"" the top judge wondered.

Siddiqui said that Swati's assets were not in line with his sources of income.

""Exceeding his authority was proven by [the] JIT already,"" Justice Ijazul Ahsan said as Justice Nisar asked Swati's counsel to opine how the case could reach its conclusive end.

""Tell us about the assets that are concealed,"" the top judge said, to which Zafar suggested that the FBR could investigate it.

""A case should be registered against a person who misuses his authority and beats the poor,"" the top judge reiterated.

",2019-01-08,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the housing ministry to resolve the issue of the alleged illegal occupation of the Capital Development Authority (CDA)'s property by Islamabad police.

According to CDA — which petitioned the apex court on the matter — a house allocated to a CDA member was first occupied in 2007 to provide residence to the then Inspector General of Police (IGP) of Islamabad. The house has since been in police possession and is currently occupied by the incumbent IGP Islamabad Muhammad Amir Zulfiqar, the CDA alleges.

A three-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar was told by a CDA official today that at least 200 more quarters have yet to be vacated by the police department.

IGP Zulfiqar, when called to the rostrum by the chief justice, claimed that he was unaware of any such situation, saying: ""I have just found this out.""

""You came [to the capital] for the Lal Masjid operation and ended up illegally occupying flats,"" observed the chief justice.

""How will [the country] function if law enforcers who are supposed to obey the laws will break them themselves.""

Subsequently, the court disposed off the case and ordered the minister for housing to look into the matter.

In the same hearing, the secretary housing briefed the court on the operation in Karachi to clear illegal occupants from government properties, saying that a committee comprising members of the National Assembly has been formed to oversee the matter.

""Aside from Karachi, there were 563 government properties that were illegally occupied and out of these 516 have been recovered,"" the housing secretary said.

At this, the top judge remarked that the reason a two-month period was granted in Karachi was due to the law-and-order situation there.

A three-judge bench headed by the chief justice was hearing a case related to Dar's non-appearance before the apex court in a corruption case pertaining to owning assets approximately valued at Rs831.7 million, disproportionate to his known sources of income.

The principle information officer apprised the court that a ""two-month deadline lapsed yesterday so notices for recovery will be sent today.""

Justice Ijazul Ahsan recalled that the National Accountability Bureau had to write a letter to the British government for Dar's extradition.

""I don't think that the Foreign Office has played any role on this issue,"" the chief justice interjected.

At this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' representative told the court that the Foreign Office had already written to the UK Central Authority. ""Now their reply is awaited,"" the representative added.

The chief justice reiterated his disappointment at Dar's failure to appear before the court before adjourning the case for a month.

Dar, the ex-finance minister in the PML-N government, has been in London since October 2017 owing to what his counsel claims is ""a medical issue"".

356,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456231/editorial-success-against-terrorism-is-surely-within-reach-if-pakistans-institutions-work-together,"Editorial: Success against terrorism is surely within reach if Pakistan's institutions work together
",2019-01-08,"UNQUESTIONABLY, Pakistan is more stable and secure than it was at the turn of the decade.

The gains in the long fight against militancy have been significant and ought to prove durable. Yet, an analysis of terrorism data suggests that the threat of militancy and terrorism is far from over, and, indeed, may be morphing into a new and possibly more prolonged phase of violence.

The Pakistan Security Report 2018, compiled by the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, is a useful aggregator of terrorism data in the country.

The latest report reveals that while violence, as measured in the number of suicide attacks (though not numbers killed or injured in such attacks) was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017, there has been persistent terrorist violence in the country in recent years.

According to the report, there were 26 suicide attacks in 2014 and 19 in 2018 and a similar number of suicide attacks in the intervening years. The number of suicide attacks is admittedly a single metric, but it is a significant one in terms of how peaceful a country is perceived to be.

The PIPS report also suggests that while the core TTP may have been decimated, splinter groups (including local affiliates of IS) continue to pose a significant problem. The Pakistani state appears to be aware of the problem, but it stresses the role of Afghanistan in the continued existence of anti-Pakistan militant groups.

To protect Pakistan against attacks organised or launched from across the border in Afghanistan, the Pakistani state has demanded that the Afghan government take measures to shut down militant sanctuaries along the border with Pakistan, and has also taken up border fencing and border management issues.

While such measures may be important, militancy has survived and morphed inside Pakistan because of local facilitation and recruitment networks. On those issues, the Pakistani state has not said much publicly. While counterterrorism operations certainly appear to be continuing, the more wide-ranging National Action Plan is still seemingly of secondary interest to the civil and military leaderships.

Unhappily, the public discourse on terrorism in Pakistan is superficial and polarising.

The undeniable successes and the enormous sacrifices of civil and military security personnel are rightly acknowledged and praised. Pakistan owes them a great debt of gratitude. But successes and sacrifices ought not to become a shield against greater public insight and informed critiques.

The country must never be allowed to return to its darkest years at the turn of the decade. Too much was lost and too many citizens suffered in part because of policy mistakes and miscalculations.

The evolving threat of militancy and terrorism in Pakistan and the region must be carefully analysed, and a response methodically crafted. If institutions work together in a true spirit of cooperation, further successes are surely well within reach.

",2019-01-08,"An art exhibition showcasing the history of martial arts and weapons opened at the National Art Gallery on Monday.

The event also included live Judo, Karate and Ninjutsu performances by Pakistani masters.

Japanese Ambassador Takashi Kurai inaugurated the travelling exhibition titled The Spirit of Budo: the history of Japan’s martial arts. The exhibition has been to many countries and is in Pakistan for the second time.

He spoke about the philosophy of martial arts, its evolution over 1,000 years — from battlefield combat techniques to popular sports or physical exercise — and how its spirit is still inherent in the daily lives of the Japanese.

Ambassador Kurai told Dawn that the exhibit aims at highlighting the spiritual aspect of the Budo through the development of body and soul.

“The martial arts attach more importance to the spiritual aspect than to combat,” he said.

With their techniques and armoury, Budo arts have been so immensely popular in the world that they are often seen as representative images of Japan, the envoy said.

“I am very glad to see the popularity of the Japanese martial arts among the Pakistani people, particularly the interest shown by youngsters in the art,” Mr Kurai said.

The two-week exhibit features paintings of 17th Century battles, photographs of Japanese sumo wrestling, reproductions of various shapes of bamboo bows, arrows, helmets and gunpowder cases, helmet breakers, armours and swords traditionally used in Budo or martial arts, representing a fascinating history of Japanese martial arts and their place in modern, global and popular culture.

Due to the many years of conflict in Japan the earliest people of the island developed an interest in the study of violence, weaponry and combat.

It was however,consolidated and formalised in the 12th Century with the rise of the professional warrior class.

Budo-martial ways- encompasses both physical and spiritual dimensions and serves as a path to self-perfection.

F.S Ninja Academy’s chief instructor Irfan Bhatti and his assistant Naveed Anwer Bhatti, who are providing martial arts training in 60 schools of the twin cities and 10 institutes, and their students performed the Ninjutsu style of judo, karate and sword amid applause from the audience.

Pak-Japan Friendship Forum president Khalid Malik said that the aim of the show is to popularise Japanese martial arts and strengthen cultural ties between the two countries.

Moeeni, a visitor, said the secret of the development and survival of a country lies in the preservation of cultural heritage and learning from the past experiences and mistakes.

“Pakistan being the cradle of ancient civilisations was once the popular destination of religious tourism. Tourists from Japan would visit the country in large numbers before the 80s. This can be revived by promoting the cultural diversity of the country”, he said.

The exhibition was organized by Japanese embassy in collaboration with Pakistan National Council of the Arts and the Japan Foundation.

The exhibition will remain open till January 21 from 9am to 5pm daily except on Mondays.

",2019-01-08,"IT was in January last year that the case of little Zainab in Kasur sparked protests across Pakistan, gripping the public’s consciousness for months, following her brutal rape and murder. Society and state went into overdrive promising to deliver justice. And though the intense public outrage and scrutiny did ultimately help in identifying and prosecuting her killer, what ought to have been a watershed moment for ensuring the rights and protection of Pakistan’s children was, to a certain extent, derailed by base motivations.

The media, which played a pivotal role in spotlighting Zainab’s case and the broader issue of rampant child sexual abuse, often succumbed to sensationalist reportage, including lurid politicised claims.

Justice for Zainab: Timeline of the Kasur rape, murder case that gripped the nation

Exposed not just for being asleep at the wheel in the face of overwhelming evidence of a serial predator in Kasur’s midst, but for having earlier killed an innocent man in a staged encounter for the latter’s crimes, the police seemed more concerned with appearing proactive rather than establishing methodical investigative norms.

Announcing her killer’s arrest, Punjab’s then chief minster struck a rather distastefully triumphant note, while a disturbingly large section of Pakistanis demanded the medieval practice of public executions. In our national distress, when fortitude and wisdom were called for, we may have not always appealed to our better nature.

Have we learnt any lessons since last year? Much of this gaucheness might be forgiven if it led to a sustained drive for social and institutional reforms. Indeed, behind the scenes, there are those who are working diligently to raise awareness and provide children and families with the necessary tools to prevent, report and heal from the physical and emotional wounds of sexual assault. But, daily reports of children being sexually abused and murdered continue to surface.

One report, tracking data on child abuse cases reported in newspapers across Pakistan, recorded 3,445 cases in 2017, and 2,322 in the first six months of 2018 alone — demonstrating a significant uptick. It is clearly only the tip of the iceberg, but does the rise actually signify an increase in the incidence rate, or does it reflect that increased awareness has reduced stigma and improved mechanisms for reporting such crimes?

The Senate committee inquiring into child abuse has lamented the lack of credible data to formulate any meaningful strategy to combat this scourge. We owe Zainab — and the countless nameless, faceless child victims like her — to do better.

359,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456222/the-next-5-years-will-be-a-rough-ride-for-pti,"The next 5 years will be a rough ride for PTI
",2019-01-08,"IT has been a short five months from hope to scathing criticism. The PTI’s fall from grace came rather quickly and unexpectedly if drawing room conversations and talk shows (as well as social media) are to be believed. The memories of 2008 and 2013 do not seem this harsh and vitriolic, even if they are faded.

Is five months enough time to judge the incompetence of the PTI, in which case the criticism should be replaced with panic? Those who have not been able to manage five months will surely make a mess in as many years. But it still seems too soon for a decisive judgement.

Or is there more to the story than just the government’s mismanagement? Those in power think so. For them, part of the criticism stems from its reformist agenda, which has worried the forces of status quo. Probe the PTI-wallahs in government and they cite a list of reasons for why they face criticism: the increased prices, the encroachment drive, the plans to reform the bureaucracy, and so on.

Is there more to the story than just the government’s mismanagement?

But there is more to the story. The context in which the PTI came to power and the hostility with which the now opposition parties were handled before and after the elections meant that the party was going to face angry criticism — no matter what. In 2008, the PPP came to power in vastly different times where the anger was directed against Musharraf. The parties opposed to him cashed in on the goodwill. And in 2013, the PPP was willing to give the PML-N space, having completed five years itself.

Know more: PML-N calls for notification details of federal cabinet members

There is no such bonhomie this time round, and the establishment’s meddling in favour of PTI has added an edge to the hostility. Add to this the hope the party itself generated in the past five years, leading its voters to think that a PTI government would set matters right in a matter of months. The sheer impossibility has not stopped disgruntled supporters from frothing at the mouth.

But the larger context cannot explain it all away.

The PTI has not helped itself. The constant attacks on the opposition and an obsessive focus on how the previous governments wronged the country have encouraged the opposition to launch a counter-assault.

And this is not simply due to the PTI-opposition ‘chemistry’.

The party’s leadership is aware of this but presses on as apparently this is what its supporters expect — any sign of softness towards the opposition apparently earns the leaders much ire from their voters. In other words, it is not dislike for the opposition, but the fear of their own supporters that compels the PTI to up the ante. This is not a party that thinks the graciousness of a government trumps the love of its supporters this far ahead of the next elections.

A second factor is the apparent disarray in its own ranks. Like the PPP, the PTI’s second-rank leadership is not scared of criticising the party head/prime minister. Islamabad is not short of stories told by anyone (who is anyone) who has had a frank discussion with a PTI-wallah about what ‘Khan’ was doing wrong (with the latter not just agreeing but also providing details). The party itself has been vocal — off the record — about ‘bad’ decisions. (Let’s not forget that the rumours about the change in the finance man at the top were said to be coming from the party itself.)

This internal censure has fed into the larger debate. The drawing room gossip in Islamabad and beyond is already grappling with an unknown entity in the shape of Imran Khan as prime minister. (No one knows for sure — the hope aside — that he can govern and can combine his impractical ideals with the realities of politics.) The prime minister’s own speeches and statements keep reinforcing the uncertainty, as do the views of his knights of the round table that the prime minister and his government is directionless. (An uncomfortable bureaucracy — for more than one reason — is also adding to this.)

Those around the prime minister say he is aware of this, but that he thinks dissenting views within the party are more important than an uncomfortable and imposed silence.

Third is the PTI’s blasé acceptance of the dreaded U-turn. The party doesn’t always do due diligence, runs headlong into wrong decisions and then backtracks without a second thought of the political costs of doing so. The recent brouhaha over the notification-that-was-not for Farrukh Saleem is a case in point. Officials claim that the good doctor brought up compensation matters a couple of months after having accepted the job, and only then did the government realise there was a ban on hirings. Nonetheless, the manner in which the entire incident played out convinces critics and supporters that the party doesn’t think matters through.

Last but not least, and linked to the third, is the PTI’s indecision as it is still trying to figure out what to do. The IMF negotiations are a case in point. An anxious business community is biting its fingernails at the government’s kabhi haan, kabhi naan to the bailout package and criticism is mounting. Indeed, the business community’s nervousness has infected the rest. And the PTI’s assurances that the matter has been sorted have not been enough. But even if the package comes through, what will happen next?

This will calm nerves and stabilise the economy somewhat. The right policies — if they come — will also help matters. But, this will go only so far in muting the criticism. Because the rest of the factors — the larger picture, the attacks on the opposition, the voices from within and even the government’s own indecision or back and forth as it figures out what to do will continue to be there. It is going to be a rough ride for the PTI and partly because this is how the party wants to play it.

",2019-01-08,"MANSEHRA: A man was killed by in-laws, while a transgender person was seriously injured by a gunman here on Monday.

Mohammad Latif told police that his son, Mohammad Shoaib, was poisoned by his father-in-law and brother-in-law after he developed differences with them and wife over a domestic issue. He said his son had been living with in-laws for almost a decade.

The police handed over the body to the family after the Shinkiari hospital doctors fulfilled formalities. Also, the police said Mohammad Waqas seriously injured transgender person Khushi by firing gunshots in Noguzi area.

The transgender persons rushed to the city police station and demanded the arrest of the gunman.

VACANCIES: Awami National Party Oghi tehsil president Khalid Khan on Monday demanded of the Peshawar Electric Supply Company to fill over 100 posts lying vacant in Oghi subdivision for a long time.

“There are over 40,000 consumers in our subdivision but they have been facing various problems due to the shortage of staff,” he told reporters here on Monday. Mr Khalid said the shortage of staff inconvenienced the people visiting the sub-divisional offices for the resolution of their problems on power meters, wires and disconnection.

",2019-01-08,"LANDI KOTAL: The administration of Khyber tribal district reopened cattle market in the militancy-affected Bara tehsil after 15 years.

A large number of local residents and cattle dealers attended the inauguration ceremony held at an open space on Frontier Road near Bara Bazaar.

Bara Traders Association president Said Ayaz Wazir and a local political leader Haji Safeeq Afridi jointly performed the inauguration of the cattle market. The officials of local administration were also present on the occasion.

The cattle market will be opened on every Monday and animals of various breeds meant for slaughtering would be brought from Orakzai, Kohat and Hangu districts besides different cities of Punjab. The market was closed some 15 years ago when a local outlawed group Lashkar-i-Islam started extorting money from the cattle traders.

Speaking on the occasion, Said Ayaz Wazir said that revival of business activities in Bara would help to compensate the traders for the monetary losses they suffered during the decade long militancy. He said that employment opportunities for local youth would be also generated with revival of business activities.

He said that business activities in Bara Bazaar were slowly picking up momentum as they had also inaugurated Peer Mela (Monday market) near Qambarabad for traders dealing in daily use commodities.

Mr Wazir, however, regretted the prolonged loadshedding of electricity and acute shortage of water in Bara Bazaar, saying local traders were badly affected by power outages and water shortage. He demanded of the authorities concerned to considerably curtail the duration of power outages at the local markets.

",2019-01-08,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan on Monday ordered the completion of homework for setting up KP Urban Mobility Authority (KPUMA) within a month.

The KP Mass Transit Act, 2016, provides for the establishment of the KPUMA, which will have jurisdiction over public transport vehicles, route permits within specific area, development of transport policies and preparation of plans for a period up to five years, and ensuring safe and clean mass transit besides other tasks.

The decision was made during a meeting regarding the establishment of the KPUMA and other traffic related issues of the provincial capital.

Says KPUMA will ensure modern traffic system

The chief minister chaired the meeting.

Earlier, the relevant officials informed Mr Mahmood about the transport and licensing policy of the KPUMA, recruitment of managing director and other relevant staff members. The chief minister was also briefed about amendments to the KPUMA Act, 2018.

Mr Mahmood also ordered the formation of a committee to examine the matter of the proposed authority under the supervision of the transport department and formulate comprehensive traffic plan for the purpose.

The committee will be headed by the finance secretary and will comprise the secretaries of transport and local government departments and DIG of traffic police Dr Akhtar Ali Shah as members.

The chief minister asked the committee to finalise all necessary arrangements for completing the homework for setting up the KPUMA within a month.

He directed the relevant officials to expedite implementation of the decisions, including recruitment of staff, and meeting of targets.

Mr Mahmood said the hiring of a qualified managing director from the market would be a step towards corporate governance and would ensure that the institutions perform in a free and independent environment.

He said all such appointments should be made on contractual basis so that the employees’ performance could be gauged from every aspect and that talented people could be inducted in the authority.

The chief minister said the Bus Rapid Transit project would emerge as the first modern and disciplined public transport system in KP.

He said the government was going to streamline the transport industry along scientific lines in the province and thus, providing the locals with the maximum jobs and the latest transport facilities in the capital city.

Mr Mahmood underlined the need for completing homework for all needs and requirements for establishment of the KPUMA.

He said all details and progress in that respect would be produced at the relevant forum as soon as possible.

The chief minister asked the officials concerned to ensure all recruitments in KPUMA on merit.

He said the government would spare no efforts to complete the BRT project in the earliest and thus, helping overcome traffic problems in Peshawar city.

Mr Mahmood said the establishment of the KPUMA would introduce a modern and disciplined traffic system in the province.

He said the government would try its level best to resolve all problems of Peshawar city on priority basis.

",2019-01-08,"ISLAMABAD: Contrary to the claims of the minister of state for interior about excessive drug use by students in the capital, a new survey has found that no more than 2pc of students in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar are regular drug users.

Quaid-i-Azam University’s Department of Sociology released the findings of a survey conducted in collaboration with the Higher Education Commission at a seminar on Monday, a statement said, in order to dispel notions of exaggerated figures on drug use in education institutions in Pakistani cities.

The seminar was based on data collected from public and private educational institutions for four ajor cities under the HEC Thematic Grants Project.

4,997 students from schools, colleges and universities in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar were surveyed

The principal investigator, Dr Imran Sabir, said that the survey found that “not more than 2pc of students are regular drug users in educational institutions”.

Dr Sabir said that figures based on a ‘secret’ report by an NGO reported by the media had caused confusion and hype about unusually high rates of drug abuse in education institutions.

Based on the same NGO report, State Minister for Interior Shehryar Afridi recently claimed that 75pc of female students and 45pc of male students in the capital are addicted to drugs, including crystal meth, also known as ice.

QAU’s new survey has a sample size of 4,997 students from schools, colleges and universities from Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar. It found that 21pc of surveyed students from public and private institutions do not consider drug abuse risky behaviour, but most students – 79pc – believed that drugs can have negative consequences on health and social aspects of life such as family, education and employment.

Dr Sabir said peer pressure plays a crucial role in adopting on-campus drug use.

Mr Afridi, who was invited to the seminar as the chief guest, praised the QAU Department of Sociology for organising the event to highlight a realistic picture of drug use in educational institutions.

Dean of Social Sciences Dr Wiqar Ali Shah praised the role of the youth in restraining drug use in educational institutions.

QAU Vice Chancellor Dr Mohammad Ali also spoke at the event about the dangers of drug use, saying that drug abuse is linked to numerous social problems including health issues, terrorism, suicide and damage to the fabric of society.

He told the youth to be vigilant and report incidents in which they come across any activity related to drug use, and said the youth must learn to say no if they are offered drugs.

Journalist Mohammad Amir Ghauri also spoke at the seminar about how to curtail drug use, adding that the youth is the future of the nation and may act as a neighbourhood watch force.

365,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456092/foreigners-security-desks-to-be-set-up-across-punjab,"Foreigners’ security desks to be set up across Punjab
",2019-01-08,"RAWALPINDI: The Punjab government has decided to establish foreigners’ security cells in the Central Police Office (CPO) and the Home Department as well as in all the districts with requisite staff and logistics.

All foreigners will inform their first arrival to the desks concerned.

The District Foreign Security Cell (DFSC) will be headed by an officer not below the rank of superintendent of police (SP) and additional secretary of the Home Department.

All foreigners will report their first arrival to District Foreign Security Cell, home dept says

The DFSC, containing China desks, will also be established in the offices of the capital city police officer (CCPO), city police officers (CPOs) and the district police officers (DPOs).

Observing enhanced international investment in the province and the expanding role of foreigners in development activities, the government has chalked out fresh standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the security of foreigners/Chinese nationals.

According to the fresh guidelines issued to all divisional police chiefs and commissioners by the Home Department, all foreigners shall report to the DFSC concerned on their arrival for the first time and will also inform it about their departure details.

The DFSC will sensitise them about their responsibilities and provide them written instructions (in English/Chinese languages) regarding security.

A computerised database and biometric record of each foreigner living or working in the jurisdiction of the police concerned will be maintained and tallied with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)’s record.

Since the tourism industry has been suffering due to security issues, the Ministry of Tourism in coordination with provincial tourism department will be responsible for devising a mechanism to ensure security of the tourists.

Tour operators may be advised to inform the tourism ministry in advance about the arrival of the foreign tourists.

Many people in the tourist category normally stay in the provincial capital or major cities but some of them visit difficult and remote parts of the province and may expose themselves unnecessarily to the dangerous environment. Security officials must inform them about the dangers and risks involved in such areas and ensure that undue risks are not taken.

There are a large number of students coming to Pakistan for studying in various educational institutions and they need to comply with all rules and regulations.

The major issue with the students is that they do not only stay beyond the expiry of their visas but also join such seminaries that function under the umbrella of proscribed organisations.

The provincial government suggested making sure that no student would be allowed to study in the province if they do not possess a study visa.

Moreover, all educational institutions must be bound to provide information about the foreign students within two days of submission of admission applications from such students. No admission to educational institutions under the student visa will be made without checking the NOC issued by the Home Department.

Conversion of the status of a visa from tourist/business to student shall be discouraged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreigners intending to study in public/private institutions or seminaries will route their request through their respective embassies for maintenance of record.

The students will not be allowed to change the institution without approval of the government.

The higher education and health departments will share the data and details of foreign students studying in colleges and universities with the Home Department or the city police office.

Many foreigners are staying in Punjab for work purposes and running their businesses such as restaurants, beauty salons, etc. It is difficult for the police to provide security to every foreigner, therefore, it is the responsibility of their employers to ensure that all safety precautions are taken and they remain in contact with the law enforcement agencies.

If the foreigners are self-employed, they should keep regular interaction with the law enforcement agencies to inform them about their safety and concerns.

However, they will be strictly advised by the DFSC to hire private security guards.

The recommendation to stop a project will be submitted to the regional police officer who will forward it to the CPO/Home Department for placement before the cabinet subcommittee on law and order for further decision.

Focal persons for foreigners

All project managements will nominate a focal person to liaison with the Home Department and the DFSC concerned about security issues.

In case of an emergency, the focal person will be responsible for coordinating with the DFSC on behalf of the project management.

A small dedicated unit, “deployment unit”, including persons from the Special Branch, representatives of the project concerned and the local police, will be deputed to provide security to the project.

Proper security organisations will be established for each major project to avoid breakdown in the chain of command.

The DFSC will issue an advisory for foreign tourists and foreigners traveling to its area.

The responsibility of overall security for all projects remains with the police and joint visits of DCs and CPOs will be planned to residences and project sites to check the security arrangements.

The joint task team should visit each site periodically and identify the shortcomings. And elite trained staff with arms and ammunition will be deployed at the vulnerable projects. They will ensure that the weapons allocated to security guards are operational and in a good condition.

The security advisory committee constituted in each area will also share their objectives about the foreigners and their activities with the DFSC concerned.

",2019-01-08,"MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan said the AJK government is determined to achieve the goal of economic self reliance by exploring new avenues of financial resources and completing projects of national importance.

He expressed these views while addressing officials of the AJK Planning and Development Department after a briefing on important development projects in AJK.

The briefing was given by Additional Chief Secretary-Development Dr Syed Asif Hussain.

The president said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider, the government was not only resolute to put the state on the path of progress and but also wanted to help Pakistan by achieving benchmarks in infrastructure development, tourism, health and education.

“It is a matter of great pride that AJK is far ahead of other provinces of Pakistan in terms of literacy rate even with inadequate infrastructure and an unfavourable learning environment,” he said.

“We are endeavouring our best to improve the requisite infrastructure by providing educational facilities and enhancing the quality of education,” he added.

He said many of the doctors, engineers and IT experts from AJK were not only serving in Pakistan but also in different parts of the world.

He said that many developed countries were willing to provide help for the development of primary and elementary education, tourism and energy sectors.

Earlier briefing the president about important development goals, Mr Hussain said that the major chunk of our development budget was being spent on improvement, rehabilitation and construction of major roads.

He said these included inter-district roads and those linking AJK with Pakistan to bring the remote areas of the state on a par with the urban developed areas and to provide best travelling facilities to the commuters in AJK.

After communications and roads, development of health and education sectors are among the top priorities of the government, added and that there is great potential to develop tourism and hydropower generation in AJK.

",2019-01-08,"ISLAMABAD: Only 30pc of children are registered in Pakistan, which also makes it difficult to identify children in cases of death and untoward instances, the Ministry of Human Rights told a parliamentary committee.

The Senate Special Committee on the Issue of Increasing Incidents of Child Abuse met on Monday at Parliament House with Senator Nuzhat Sadiq in the chair.

Ministry of Human Rights Secretary Rabiya Javeri Agha said the protection of children is a huge challenge.

“The laws are very clear but their implementation is a challenge. As per the directions of the committee, we have written letters to the provinces, asking them for data about incidents with children but we have not received a reply. The ministry is relying on private data and is serious about making a credible database,” she said.

Ms Agha said the best child protection centre is in Punjab and that though there is a child protection centre in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, its performance is not up to the mark due to a lack of resources.

Deputy Inspector General of Police Islamabad Faisal Ali said that during the last five years, 260 non-registered and 300 registered cases have come into the police’s knowledge.

“Police stations have been directed to register cases of missing children without delay and special barracks have been made for children who are arrested for seeking alms,” he said.

Replying to a question, he said there is no mechanism for exchanging data between the police and the Federal Investigation Agency.

The committee was informed that 3,445 cases of child abuse have been reported last year, according to data collected by NGOs.

Senator Sadiq said the surge in cases of child sexual abuse is an important point to note. She expressed annoyance that the Minister for Human Rights, Dr Shireen Mazari was not attending the meeting and said she had not been there in the last one either.

A representative of the ministry informed the chair that the minister was in the Prime Minister’s Office.

Jamaat-i-Islami Senator Mushtaq Ahmed said that according to government data, some 25 million children are currently out of school.

He wondered why underage offenders are not kept in juvenile centres even though such a facility exists in KP.

",2019-01-08,"ISLAMABAD: The chief justice of Pakistan said on Monday that he would not tolerate any carelessness on the part of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) that could waste Rs10 billion in funding offered by Bahrain for Pakistan’s first nursing university.

Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar had summoned NAB Chairman Javed Iqbal to his chambers on Jan 4, after expressing disappointment with impediments to obtaining possession of land on which the university is to be built.

Justice Nisar had remarked that the bureau had started defaming and humiliating people on the basis of single or frivolous complaints and questioned its criteria for entertaining complaints.

NAB, CDA told to address land issue so construction can begin

The chief justice was told that the CDA could not take possession of land for the project while an inquiry is pending with NAB.

On Monday, the court directed NAB and the CDA to address the land issue and ensure construction of the university begins soon.

King Hamad of Bahrain had announced funding for King Hamad University of Nursing and Associated Medical Sciences in 2014, and it had been decided that Pakistan would arrange land and utility services for the university while Bahrain would fund its construction.

It was to be built on 237 kanals of land on Park Road in Chak Shahzad to cater to 2,000 students with 500 annual admissions.

It will also include on-campus residential facilities for 1,000 women.

A Bahraini delegation visited Islamabad in July 2016, and its foundation stole was laid by then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif in January 2017, but the unavailability of land delayed the project both times.

Some 700 people have filed applications with the CDA claiming to be owners of land that is to be taken over for the university.

With the project continuously delayed, then prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in September 2017 directed the Minister of Capital Administration and Development Division to address the land issue. However, possession of the land was not provided to the Ministry of National Health Services even then.

Possession of the land has not been obtained to date, because of which the NHS ministry is considering asking the Bahraini government to build the university at the National Institute of Health (NIH), and the land in Chak Shahzad can later be handed over to the NIH.

An NHS ministry official seeking anonymity said the project will be built on a turn-key basis.

",2019-01-08,"OKARA: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar has approved Rs9.5 million compensation for the victims of the February 2018 terrorist attack in Kharan district of Balochistan and ordered the two employer companies to pay Rs20,000 per month to each of the six families for the next three years.

About 11 months back, labourers Mazhar, Shahzad Ali, Riaz, Waqas, Fakhar Rafique and Amant Ali of Okara village Kikriwala were killed during the terror attack.

The workers were asleep at the [mobile phone tower] construction site when the incident took place. Another labourer Faryad Husain of village 49/2-L (Okara) suffered injuries.

After this act of terrorism, CJP Saqib Nisar had taken suo motu notice of the incident as a case of human rights. After the proceedings, the CJP ordered the two companies to pay compensation worth Rs9.5m.

The family of each of the six deceased will get Rs1.5m. A sum of Rs0.5m will be given to injured Faryad Husain. The district and sessions judge received two cheques from the companies.

A cheque issued by one firm had some error and the judge returned it for correction with a letter to the Kharan deputy commissioner and a copy of it was also sent to the Okara DC and set Jan 15, 2019, deadline for receipt of the cheque at the court.

",2019-01-08,"LAHORE: As the distribution companies (Discos) continue to observe loadshedding for hours on a daily basis, official sources say the situation will improve after Jan 10 when the power plants will start receiving Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG).

“At present there is no LNG for the plants. However, it will be available to plants after arrival of the ship carrying LNG at Port Qasim (Karachi) probably on Jan 10 or 11,” a senior official told Dawn on Monday.

The official said due to non-availability of LNG, the plants including Balloki, Bhikki, Hallmore, Saif, Saphire, Fauji, Rosche and Kapco (nine units) are closed.

Only Haveli Bahadur Shah and Orient plants are operational since they are receiving indigenous gas (over 120MMCFD) from the SNGPL’s system. “120MMCFD is half of the total supply to Haveli and Orient plants. It means that these plants are generating power half of their total capacity,” he added. He said besides these some plants including Uch (1, 2) and Guddu-747 were being provided with local gas directly from [gas] fields.

He said since the hydel generation had already been squeezed to a couple of 100 megawatts due to low flow season, the generation being added to the national grid was either from some furnace or local gas-fired plants. “At present the total demand ranges between 10,000 and 11,000MW. And the generation is just 7,000MW or so. So there is shortfall of 3,000 to 4,000MW in the system, forcing the Discos to observe load shedding,” he added.

On the other hand, the Discos continue to observe loadshedding for hours in the areas of all categories of high-loss feeders.

“Since the allocated power quota of our company has been squeezed due to shortfall, we are observing loadshedding for two to eight hours in the areas of all high-loss feeders falling under category 1 to 5,” said another official.

",2019-01-08,"LAHORE: Indian journalist, activist and former president of the Mumbai Press Club Jatin Desai stressed restoration of talks between India and Pakistan, lamenting the suspension of bilateral talks between the countries since 2016.

“It is extremely unfortunate that there has been a complete silence on both sides, resulting in the suffering of the peoples. Just keeping the communication alive changes everything,” he said and added that its right time in India for holding talks as it can bring about change in the atmosphere.

Mr Desai had worked hard for the release of Indian national Hamid Nehal Ansari who went back home from Pakistan last month. On Ansari’s release, Desai had accompanied his family to the Wagah border to receive him.

Talking about the gesture by Pakistan, Mr Desai said the release of Hamid Ansari was a positive development.

Demands Kartarpur-like steps in both countries beyond Punjab

“Prisoners on both sides should be treated as humans,” he demanded.

The Indian journalist, who is also secretary general of the Pakistan-India Peoples’ Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFPD), was greeted by the local journalists and civil society activists at the Lahore Press Club on Monday where he spoke about a range of shared issues plaguing both India and Pakistan and possible ways to resolve them. The issues ranged from industrial waste dumped into rivers and shared air pollution to failed diplomacy problems between the two countries.

Talking about the Kartarpur, which is in the news since its opening for Sikh pilgrims by Pakistan, he said: “The Katarpur corridor is a great development even though the traffic is expected to be more one-sided. Such developments should happen all over Pakistan and India beyond Punjab for there are people all in both countries who want to visit each other”.

Mr Desai had started a dialogue for peace by establishing connection between the Mumbai Press Club and its counterpart in Karachi.

“We need to respect each other. That is so very important. No one wants war, everyone wants peace. And in these times, journalists have an integral role to play.”

Jatin Desai termed the role of the media important to help sustain the dialogue for peace.

“We initially had four journalists from India and Pakistan, each corresponding from both the countries but following tense relations, they were reduced to two journalists on each side and now there are none. This must be the biggest failure in keeping relations alive.”

Desai said the few media houses that had their correspondents on either side were nationals of their own country. India exchanged correspondents with Nepal, Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries but ironically a huge chunk of Indian news remained about Pakistan, he revealed.

“To have an Indian correspondent in Pakistan and a Pakistani correspondent in India can a completely different impact on the news. A foreign correspondent would see things from a completely different perspective than a local one.”

To Desai, these correspondents would serve as links between the public and their country’s high commissions.

“But both the countries are so insecure that they are not letting the other’s correspondents come and stay. They should display more self confidence.”

Mr Desai demanded both the countries to send journalists on exchange programmes.

He also demanded easy visa regimes for genuine reasons. “There should be a medical visa category which should be given on an emergency basis,” he suggested. He regretted India had been trying to quash the SAARC summit which had not been taking place for years.

Lahore Press Club secretary Zahid Abid concluded the session by thanking Jatin Desai.

",2019-01-08,"SAHIWAL: The American Sikh Council (ASC) and the Sikh in America (SIA) have appealed to the Pakistani government to make sure that the Kartarpur Sahib Complex (KSC) is maintained in its original state.

A message posted at the website of the ASC reads that “any structural changes and/or additions to accommodate upcoming huge visitors either coming from India, Pakistan or Sikh diaspora living across globe by lodging to restrooms and more must be done at a distance, away from the main KSC so that the Kartarpur Sahib original farms, natural areas spread around 100 acres of land that belonged to Guru Sahibji, and the forest areas around the River Ravi can retain as much of its originality as possible. This needs to be preserved in its original landscape for posterity”.

The appeal was made in the background of recent development where both Pakistani and Indian governments agreed to open up Kartarpur Corridor for Sikhs to visit the birthplace of their prophet Baba Guru Nanak.

Dr Gurdas Singh, ASC president, and Gurinder Pal Singh, SIA president, told Dawn by phone the Pakistani government might change the original archeological and cultural structure and lawns of the complex.

Gurinder Pal Singh said they feared that in the name of development sometimes original and historical architecture were not being taken care of by contractors.

“Such efforts must be and should be kept at bay without compromising original structure spread across 100 acres,” he explained.

He said the Auqaf Department and the Pakistan Gurdwara Parbandak Committee must understand the legitimate concerns of the Sikh diaspora.

He said Sikhs everywhere yearned to visit the Kartarpur Sahibje and see the fields that their wondrous ‘Guru’ tilled with his own hands, the place where he lived, the trees he sat under and feel and touch their forehead on the same dusty soil that their ‘Guru’ walked on!

Both ASC and SIA presidents thanked the Pakistani government for opening the Kartarpur Corridor and taking “proactive step towards peace and amity of two people (Indian Punjab and Pakistani Punjab) who have so much in common, from language to food, from Punjabi poetry to clothes and so much more”.

Dr Gurdas told Dawn a group of young American Sikhs started a Facebook page to monitor and report on the developments of the Kartarpur Corridor and to make concerned voices heard in regards to the development.

GP Singh says Kartarpur Sahib is the place where the founder of the Sikh faith spent 18.5 years of his life as a farmer, a householder, a husband, a father while spreading the word of love, humanism, universal sisterhood and brotherhood and making sure that his followers learnt how to raise their voices against any kind of tyranny, be it state repression or social discrimination.

Kartarpur Sahib can be called the first Gurdwara which was established in 1521. Bhai Dhuni Chand donated 100 acres to Baba Guru Nanak Sahibji. This land is still associated with the KGC. Both organizations wished that it would be heartening to see if any renowned Pakistani architecture along with provincial department of archaeology gets involved in revising and keeping old structure intact.

373,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456158/two-cars-given-to-lahore-dcs-office-retrieved,"Two cars given to Lahore DC's office retrieved
",2019-01-08,"LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday ordered retrieval of two official vehicles from the Lahore deputy commissioner’s (DC) office within 24 hours for their onward allocation to two special assistants to the chief minister.

In exchange for the two vehicles, the government has left two used 2014-model cars at the disposal of the DC’s office, which sources see as a bid to please the special assistants.

“The 2018-model cars, which were part of the deputy commissioner’s office pool, were allocated by the government a few months ago to replace two 2004-model vehicles. One was being used by Deputy Commissioner Saleha Saeed and the other by Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Awais Malik,” an official source told Dawn.

According to a letter sent to the commissioner, the government has decided to retrieve the DC office’s vehicles in light of the recommendations of a sub-committee of the cabinet for their allocation to the provincial cabinet, rationalising the official vehicles.

“The provincial cabinet in its meeting of Dec 29, 2018 has approved recommendations of its sub-committee. Under these, LEG-18-9586 and LEG-18-8586 should be retrieved from the office of DC Lahore and the same allocated to Mr Javaid Akhtar Ansari (special assistant to the CM) and Syed Rafaqat Ali Gillani (special assistant to the CM), respectively,” the letter reads. “The vehicles -- LEG-14-622 and LEG-14-620 -- of the pool of the services and general administration department (S&GAD) will be given to the Lahore DC office,” it adds.

Will be allocated to CM’s special assistants

The government, through the letter, directed the commissioner to retrieve the newer cars from the DC’s office along with registration and log books within 24 hours and hand them over in lieu of the older model cars.

The source called the cabinet’s decision surprising since it should have recommended arranging of official vehicles for the CM’s special assistants from the S&GAD pool rather than the DC’s office.

“The vehicles officially designated for the office of the DC are mostly used in field jobs such as administration, revenue, relief etc,” he added. “It clearly sends a message that the provincial government wants new cars for its own advisers and special assistants.”

SEALED: A team of the city administration on Monday sealed two farmhouses for flouting the one-dish and time restrictions. The team also got cases registered against the owners, according to a spokesman. It also got the organsier arrested of a wedding at a private university for flouting the same rules.

374,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456160/opposition-gives-a-hard-time-to-treasury-for-violating-rule,"Opposition gives a hard time to treasury for violating rule
",2019-01-08,"LAHORE: The opposition on Monday caught the treasury on the wrong foot as it got the decision of Speaker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, who nominated Mian Shafi Muhammad to preside over the session in his absence since he is acting as governor, reversed, accusing him of arrogating the right of the House and committing a sheer illegality.

It all started as soon as the House began its proceedings at 4.25pm, instead of 2pm, and Mian Shafi occupied the speaker’s chair. The opposition wondered how he could be sitting there. Malik Ahmed Khan of the opposition called it sheer illegality and sought explanation from the minister for law and parliamentary affairs.

The minister tried to justify the new occupant, saying that Speaker Pervaiz Elahi had nominated him to preside over the session. Where did this nomination take place, if not in, and by, the House? The opposition wondered. “In his chamber,” answered the law minister. It provided new vigour to the opposition, which maintained that it was completely illegal nomination.

“Rule 13/2 of the Punjab Assembly clearly maintains that in absence of the speaker and deputy speaker, the secretary assembly would inform the House as such, announce a panel of chairmen and let the House decided who would be presiding over the session.” In the presence of such clear instructions, how can the speaker nominate a person, and that too in his discretion and chamber? It was tantamount to snatching the right of the House.

Nomination to preside over session without House approval stirs up controversy

The treasury tried to put up a defence: the only objection the opposition is trying to raise is that the speaker can nominate a person in the House, not in his chamber – speaker is speaker, whether in the House or outside, and has the right. But the defence soon collapsed as Samiullah Khan of the PML-N warned that these proceedings, involving expenditures from the provincial exchequer and legality of the proceedings, would be challenged in the court.

At this point, Law Minister Raja Bashrat conceded the rule 13/2 of the assembly needs to followed and asked the secretary to announce a panel of chairmen, and then he himself moved a motion to nominate Mian Shafi Muhammad as the one who could preside over the proceedings.

The opposition genuflected but not before posing another trouble: how about the legality of one hour of proceedings that have been presided over by the man, which involved oath of Assad Ali – a newly elected MPA from Lahore. The chair, however, came up with a solution proposed by a minister: through a ruling, it validated all proceedings that took place before the implementation of the rule 13/2, leaving the opposition again questioning as to how could an illegal occupant of the chair validate his own invalidity? But the chair was not in a mood to oblige and it immediately took up the question hour.

The number started thinning as soon as the controversy settled down and it was more of a matter of time before anyone could point out the quorum and the moment came around 7.25pm when Shazia Abid of the PPP pointed out quorum, winding up the proceedings for the day. The House would now meet on Tuesday (today) morning.

",2019-01-08,"LAHORE: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Lahore, has approved filing of two references against officials of the Lahore Development Authority ( LDA) and the Public Health Engineering Cooperative Housing Society for allegedly committing a fraud in commericialisation fee and illegal allotment of plots, respectively.

Presiding over a meeting of the Lahore bureau officials here on Monday, Director General Shahzad Saleem approved filing of the references in both the cases and upgrade of an inquiry in the Khadija Commodities Pvt Ltd case.

“The board decided to file a supplementary reference against (10 or so) LDA officials for misusing authority and gaining illegal advantages by corrupt means which caused financial loss to the national exchequer worth millions,” said a bureau spokesman, adding it had already filed an interim reference in this regard.

According to NAB, the LDA officials misused the government funds in connection with commercialisation fees, thus causing a loss of millions to national exchequer.

In the Public Health Engineering Cooperative Housing Society case, its former president Hafiz Sarfraz Anwar and former general secretary Malik Sajjad Haider allegedly cheated the public at large by allotting numerous commercial plots and misappropriating funds during the sale proceeds and also through illegal transfer of plots mortgaged with LDA.

NAB said both suspects in connivance with one another caused a loss to the society to the tune of Rs5.3m in electrification works.

The NAB board also decided to upgrade investigation against the owners of the Khadija Commodities Pvt Ltd following the allegations of cheating public at large. The suspects are accused of embezzling Rs270m.

According to NAB, suspects Qasim Bilal and Muhammad Arshad Elahi allegedly committed fraud with more than 900 people in the name of online investment.

“The Khadija Commodities defrauded over 900 people/investors depriving them of Rs270m,” it said. The suspects have been in NAB custody on physical remand.

376,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456075/salt-tolerant-plants-could-tackle-food-insecurity,"‘Salt-tolerant plants could tackle food insecurity’
",2019-01-08,"KARACHI: Experts at the inaugural session of a three-day international conference which opened at Karachi University (KU) on Monday underscored the need for exploring the potential of salt-tolerant plants to tackle increasing food insecurity.

These efforts, they emphasised, must be supported by background research aimed at bringing out solutions that are both economically and environmentally viable and sustainable.

Titled ‘Sustainable development: halophytes for green revolution’, the event began at KU’s business school. It’s the second international conference organised by KU’s Institute of Sustainable Halophyte Utilisation (ISHU) on the campus.

Speaking on the conference theme, Prof Hans-Werner Koyro, a senior plant ecologist from Germany, said that the requirement of getting good quality food was increasing day by day with the growing population.

One solution to address this challenge, he pointed out, was to explore halophytes, salt-tolerant plants that grew in waters of high salinity. These plants offered a range of benefits, including their use as food, fodder and biofuel.

These plants also contained medicinal properties and helped protect the coastline.

Prof Koyro, however, cautioned researchers on how they should work with these plants and urged them to “restructure their work”.

“You must have detailed background knowledge of the environment you choose to work in as well as information about the resistance of the plant, its benefits and disadvantages before you start work,” he said, emphasising that the research needed to be ecologically sustainable and economically feasible.

“A university like KU needs to ensure that you do not end up creating worse (environmental) conditions than before,” he added.

Dr Miguel Clusener-Godt, director of ecological and earth sciences division of Unesco, appreciated KU’s research endeavours in the field of halophyte biology.

He was of the view that food shortages could be minimised by adopting halophyte as nonconventional crops for already salt-affected land. The conference theme, he noted, was in line with the sustainable development goals and also with Unesco’s Man and the Biosphere Programme.

Dr Benno Boer, chief of natural sciences, Unesco Bangkok office, spoke about the efforts of KU’s scientists in global halophyte research and said that they made substantial contributions putting Pakistan on the world map as a country with significant achievements in this important scientific subject.

He appreciated ISHU’s research initiatives and said that increasing waterlogging and salinity was a major problem in Sindh and the government would support initiatives offering solutions in this regard.

KU Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Muhammad Ajmal Khan presented a global overview of population growth, water availability situation, and the status of natural resources.

“The changing climatic conditions have exacerbated the situation. We have to find new avenues to enhance our food production, make clean energy, as well as reduce pressure on limited freshwater resources for agriculture in arid regions,” he said.

On how halophytes could help, Prof Khan said that cultivation of these plants thriving on saline water could help produce fodder for livestock especially in areas like Thar where livestock was directly linked to human survival and prosperity.

“We have already developed a model halophyte fodder farm in Thar. The provincial chief minister has also visited it and shown interest in taking it to the next level,” he said, hoping that the farm would soon see big plantation.

He was of the opinion if the government took advantage of this important research, Tharis wouldn’t have to migrate to other places in search of food.

Earlier, Dr Bilquees Gul, ISHU director, welcomed attendees and said that the aim of the conference was to discuss sustainable use of halophytes and bring together leading experts in the field of halophyte biology to develop a collaborative programme.

",2019-01-08,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court-mandated commission on water and sanitation in Sindh has directed sugar mills to install effluent treatment plants before the crushing season 2019-20 begins.

The commission, headed by former Supreme Court judge Amir Hani Muslim, warned that the sugar mills in Sindh must strictly follow the timeline and if the effluent treatment plants were not made functional before the upcoming crushing season, the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) would seal such industrial units.

On Monday, the commission was informed that Sepa had approved the initial environmental examinations regarding installation of treatment plants and handed them to the sugar mills concerned. It was further told that Seri Sugar Mill was non-functional and, therefore, did not need a treatment plant.

Subsequently, Justice Muslim directed the owner or any authorised officer of the mill to submit an undertaking that they would only make the sugar mill functional after the installation of an effluent treatment plant in terms of Sepa rules and in case of non-compliance, the industrial unit would face closure.

In a previous hearing, the commission was informed that the industries had processed their cases for the installation of effluent treatment plants through a firm, Technology Provider, and they would complete the assignment within the timeline agreed between the parties.

However, the commission had warned that any non-compliance on part of the firm would not absolve the industries from consequences.

In August, the commission had ordered Dr Ghulam Murtaza of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources for inspection of all sugar mills and distilleries with officials of Sepa across the province to suggest installation of treatment plants for effluent. Later, the inspection report was handed over to Sepa to finalise it.

The report said that there were 38 sugar mills in Sindh and 37 were functional, adding that treatment plants in four sugar mills had already been in place while the remaining industrial units were required to install effluent treatment plants.

Meanwhile, the commission granted a firm two-day time to submit an undertaking that it would make functional the 59 reverse osmosis plants it had installed in various districts of Sindh after the project director and chief engineer of the public health engineering department informed it about the status of Clean Drinking Water for All plants installed by the private firm.

",2019-01-08,"KARACHI: The Sindh cabinet on Monday cancelled allotment of 70,000 acres of forest land and decided to launch an operation to get 145,245 acres of illegally occupied such land vacated from influential persons.

The cabinet meeting also approved a Rs900 million donation for the Thar Foundation for investment to pay Rs100,000 annually to each of the 757 families affected by Gorano reservoir and Dukkur Chho Pond as a compensation.

By another decision, it approved two fare slabs for Qingqi rickshaws — Rs10 from 0 to 6 kilometres and Rs15 for more than 6km per passenger — and approved the amendment in the Sindh Local Government Act 2013 for the removal of a mayor, deputy mayor, chairman or vice chairman from the office if a vote of no-confidence was passed against him with a simple majority.

Amends LG law to remove mayor, others with a simple majority of council members

These were among the decisions taken by the cabinet, which met here at New Sindh Secretariat presided over by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah. The meeting, which lasted for four hours, had an agenda spread over 30 items. Those who attended the meeting included Chief Secretary Mumtaz Shah, all provincial ministers, advisers and special assistants.

In the backdrop of the order of the apex court to get all forest land vacated, the meeting was informed by Forest Minister Syed Nasir Shah that 13,000 acres out of 145,245 had already been retrieved from illegal occupants. The chief minister asked the minister to get the remaining land vacated at the earliest with the help of police and Rangers.

Compensation

Energy Minister Imtiaz Shaikh stated that 757 families living in a one-kilometre radius of Gorano reservoir and Dukkur Chho Pond had been affected apart from those 471 who had been displaced owing to the development/excavation of Thar coalfield block-II.

The cabinet also approved a compensation of Rs100,000 for the 471 affected families of Thar block-II to be paid by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company because they were leaseholders. The 471 families were also being provided with one house in two villages — Senhri Dars and Tharyo Halepoto.

The cabinet asked the chief minister to approach the federal government to pay the affected families from oil and gas fields compensation on the same pattern and ensure local development.

Automatic meter-reading system

The meeting extended the period for the completion of the installation of an automatic meter-reading system till May 2019 by Hesco and Sepco.

Under an agreement for which Rs27.398 billion was paid to Discos (Hesco Rs10.228bn and Sepco Rs17.17bn) to clear all outstanding electricity dues for the period from July 2010 to 2016.

In addition, a monthly amount was also agreed to be paid to Hesco, Rs555.82 million, and Rs513.73m to Sepco, till the installation of AMR systems.

Sugar-cane price

The cabinet on the suggestion of Agriculture Minister Ismail Rahu approved the sugarcane price to the growers not lower than Rs182 per 40kg. The meeting also authorised the agriculture minister to appoint market committees.

Approving the two-slab Qingqi fares as suggested by the transport department, the chief minister asked why the registration of the rickshaws was delayed and directed the officials concerned to ensure proper safety precautions in the rickshaws and also register them.

Regarding allotment policy, Secretary Services and General Administration Zulfiqar Shah briefed the cabinet on the present status of the allotments saying that there were six residential colonies of the provincial government in Karachi.

The cabinet discussed the allotment status and said that the forcible vacation of the accommodation from those residing there against the policy would be ethically wrong. Therefore, the cabinet approved one-time waiver for the present allottees and till their retirement they would be entitled to staying there. However, no allotment against the policy would be made onward.

Recruitments

The cabinet approved recruitment for the posts in BPS-1 to BPS-15 on merit. The chief minister directed publication of advertisements in the press and making selection committees. In lower grades only locals would be recruited. However, there would be a five per cent quota for the disabled and 5pc for minorities.

The cabinet constituted a three-member committee under Energy Minister Imtiaz Shaikh to frame rules for recruitment and to start recruitment.

LG law amendments

The cabinet approved amendments to the Local Govt Act 2013 presented by Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani for the removal of a mayor, deputy mayor, chairman or vice chairman from office if a vote of no-confidence was passed with a simple majority which at present requires a two-thirds majority of the total number of members of the council.

The cabinet authorised the local government minister to appoint the remaining members of the Hyderabad Development Authority and other authorities where required.

By another decision, it approved the creation of a separate department in place of the Sindh Board of Investment and also renewal of contract of Prof Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan Rajput as chairman of the Charter of Inspection and Evaluation Committee.

The irrigation department presented three names, Imtiaz Qazi, Idrees Rajput and Abdul Basit Soomro, for chairman of the Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority. The cabinet approved the appointment of Basit Soomro as the two other were not available technically.

379,https://www.dawn.com/news/1456083/sattar-comes-up-with-new-plan-to-unite-all-mqm-factions,"Sattar comes up with new plan to unite all MQM factions
",2019-01-08,"KARACHI: Disgruntled Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan leader Dr Farooq Sattar said on Monday that he would soon announce a new forum — the Muttahida Qaumi Council (MQC) — to unite all factions of the once-unified Mohajir Qaumi Movement.

“I have been contacting everyone and [reminding them] we all were at the same platform in 1986 whether it was Mustafa Kamal, Anis Kaimkhani, Afaq Ahmed or Saleem Haider,” he told reporters after his court appearance at City Courts.

“I will very soon announce the formation of the Muttahida Qaumi Council ... and senior lawyers, doctors, engineers, traders, businessmen and people from all linguistic backgrounds will be part of it,” he added.

Wants mayor stopped from ‘destroying’ people’s properties and businesses

“This was the mission of Shaheed Ali Raza Abidi bhai and we have to take it forward to unite everyone,” he said, referring to the slain MQM-P leader who was gunned down on Dec 25, 2018 in front of his Defence residence.

Dr Sattar has been ousted from the MQM-P by his rivals, better known as the Bahadurabad group, after he announced an Organisation Restoration Committee (ORC) in October last. Since then, he has been very critical of his opponents, including Karachi Mayor Wasim Akhtar.

When asked whether he had contacted Mohajir Qaumi Movement-Haqiqi chief Afaq Ahmed and Pak Sarzameen Party chairman Mustafa Kamal, he said he had sent them a message and would personally contact them after formally announcing the MQC later this week.

Answering a question, he said the head of the “MQM of 1986” would be chosen by workers through election.

Asked whether MQM founder Altaf Hussain would get any role in the new forum, he said: “We had dissociated ourselves from London ... I am not providing space to London and the MQM founder, but the way elections were engineered and I was removed ... it all goes in London’s favour.”

He, however, made it clear that he was not going to launch a new party. “We have to make this party [MQM] the party of 1986. There is no new name or party. We have to reorganise this party and make it the party of the poor and common people.”

‘Mayor destroying people’s livelihood’

Criticising Mayor Wasim Akhtar for razing around 9,000 shops in Karachi in the name of drive against encroachments, he said: “I don’t know who the mayor is pleasing.”

He said the mayor was destroying the livelihood of the people of Karachi.

The coordination committee of the MQM-Pakistan, including Amir Khan, Kanwar Naveed and Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, must stop Mayor Akhtar from “destruction” of people’s property and businesses, he demanded.

He appealed to the prime minister to take immediate action to solve the water problem in Karachi and to avoid “water riots” in the upcoming summer.

Seeks better security for all politicians

He criticised the law enforcement agencies for asking him and other political leaders to restrict their movement in view of threats following the murder of PSP workers and Mr Abidi. He said he could not limit his movement.

",2019-01-08,"LAHORE: At his house on the busy Mall Road, environmental lawyer Rafay Alam runs three air purifiers around the clock, keeps his windows shut and stuffs towels into the gaps under his doors.

Some winter days, when the city’s smog is particularly bad, “I don’t send my daughter to school,” he admits. “I am not going to risk permanent damage to her lungs.”

Safety guide: How to safeguard your health from smog

The country’s second-largest city is choking on smog, driven in part by smoke from bricks kiln and steel mills, burning of rice stubble and garbage, growing numbers of vehicles on the road and large-scale losses of trees as the expanding city makes way for new roads and buildings, residents say.

Many in the city of 11 million complain of headaches and burning eyes and throats as air pollution levels this winter have on some days hit five times the legal limit, according to a global air quality index that many in Lahore check via the AirVisual phone app.

Alam thinks it’s time for the government to declare a public health emergency on the worst days, when the air is full of dust and pollutants that can cause health issues including asthma, lung damage, bronchial infections and heart problems.

Many in Lahore complain of headaches and burning eyes as air pollution levels have recently hit five times the legal limit

The air pollution in Lahore is bad throughout the year, but in winters there is temperature inversion where a layer of warm air is prevented from rising and it traps all the pollutants below it, which renders them visible, he said.

Lahore, once known as the Garden City but now choked with cars, regularly figures on air quality indexes as one of the most polluted cities in the world — and many of the pollutants are also drivers of climate change.

The PTI government has restarted air quality monitoring in Lahore after the previous government ceased it two years ago, said Adviser to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam.

During that two-year period, air quality monitoring stations in the province weren’t working because of lack of funding and capacity, Alam said.

The prime minister, who grew up in Lahore, said he sees tackling the city’s smog problem as a priority.

“It is a serious issue that must be addressed,” Mr Khan told his cabinet.

In November, the Lahore High Court ordered the Punjab government to implement recommendations of the Smog Commission, set up by the court in 2017 to look at the drivers of smog and find ways to reduce them.

Those included curbing emissions from factories, closing brick kilns that fail to use fuel-efficient technology, and fining polluting vehicles and farmers burning rice stubble in the winter.

The commission also ordered planting of trees in urban areas and efforts to spread environmental awareness in schools.

Monitors, meetings

Mr Aslam said the government now has a team travelling around Lahore reading the city’s air quality monitors, with the data feeding into the city’s own air quality index.

That index, updated daily, is posted for public use on the Environmental Protection Department’s website.

Since coming into office, Mr Khan has organised meetings with brick kiln owners and won a two-month winter shutdown of factories in 12 districts, including Lahore.

The government has also pushed brick kiln owners to shift to cleaner technology, offering loans to make the switch, as well as issuing fines for kilns that operate using the dirtiest technologies, such as burning used tires.

The Environment Protection Department has fined farmers who burn crop stubble — a traditional practice — and is looking at promoting zero tillage farming as an alternative, though making the switch will be costly for farmers, Aslam admitted.

As well, the government is considering setting higher emissions standards for vehicles — but warned the switch could make petrol “more expensive for consumers as a result”, he said.

The Environmental Protection Department said the level of smog pollution was lower this year than last in Lahore because of anti-smog measures already under way.

But Mr Alam said monitors installed in his house continue to show hazardous levels in his neighbourhood.

It’s not just brick kilns and farmers who are causing air pollution. The country uses the most polluted fuel in the world and tackling this problem will require a tremendous change in the energy and transport sectors, he said.

He said the country needed a nation-wide system of air quality monitors in its cities to better understand what is happening and drive action.

Cutting smog would have other benefits as well, he said.

“By reducing greenhouse gases that cause air pollution you are also addressing climate change. The two are linked.”

Abid Omar, who founded the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, a non-profit group that publishes data about air pollution and its health impacts, agreed that a broad approach is needed.

“We have to reduce air pollution at the source, be it industry, agriculture, urban waste or transportation. This will require time, money and planning,” he admitted.

",2019-01-08,"ISLAMABAD: The Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) has directed government institutions to commercialise research breakthroughs in the country.

The commission, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar, issued the directive after a hearing of stakeholders in Islamabad on Monday.

Justice Nisar had taken a suo motu notice in December regarding commercialisation of research breakthroughs.

National Health Services (NHS) Minister Aamer Mehmood Kiani, Executive Director of the National Institute of Health Dr Aamer Ikram, Chief Executive Officer of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) Sheikh Akhtar Hussain and Chairman of the Higher Education Commission Dr Tariq Banuri were among those who attended the hearing.

The Law and Justice Commission asked the Higher Education Commission to consider setting up a “biotech park” for benefit of undergraduate and postgraduate students. The HEC was also asked to arrange training modules in biotechnology, life sciences, agriculture and pharmaceuticals.

Dr Javed Akram, Vice Chancellor of the University of Health Sciences (UHS) , told Dawn that the Ministry of National Health Services had assured the commission that a committee would be established by Jan 15 to ensure clinical trials of researches.

Dr Akram said universities, the Pakistan Health Research Council, HEC, Pakistan Science Foundation and other institutions spent around Rs100 billion a year on research, but their breakthroughs were never commercialised. Thus the consumer has no option but to spend an amount 10 to 20 times higher on different products.

There were a number of breakthroughs, but the public did not benefit from them because of pressure from international companies, he added.

“When I was vice chancellor at the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Medical University, a research study was started to make artificial skin since, according to a study, the ratio of burn injury cases was the highest in Pakistan.

“After becoming UHS vice chancellor, I shifted the research to this institution and finally we came up with artificial skin in our laboratory last year. We contacted Drap for issuance of licence for commercial manufacturing, but it was not done,” he recalled.

Had the licence been issued, “we could have manufactured artificial skin and reduced mortality from 70pc to 40pc”, Dr Akram added.

According to him, skin costs $700 per square inch in the international market, but in Pakistan it can be sold for just Rs710.

384,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1813087/6-asad-umar-checks-pakistan-financial-rehab-clinic/,Asad Umar checks Pakistan into a financial rehab clinic,2018-09-28,"One cannot expect a drug addict to find a job before he reform­s his behavi­our

Heroin is to drug addicts what foreign exchange (read dollars) is to Pakistan’s economy right now. When a drug addict enters a rehabilitation clinic, he often perceives the doctor as the enemy, stripping away the addict’s ability to experience joy in life. Asad Umar is in a similar position with the Pakistani people, as he weans us off debt and expensive imports. In this case, like the addict, it’s easier for us to fight the doctor instead of the disease. The irony is that the doctor only has one goal at heart: to make the patient feel better and live life to its fullest.

Asad Umar has emerged from whatever rock or container he was hiding under by presenting the mini-budget last week. His silence on a substantive economic policy in the first few days of government was confusing because he’s never been short of opinions while in the opposition. But it seems like Asad has taken the first few weeks in government to digest the enormity of economic challenges in front of him. Let us assume Pakistan is a family with 100 rupees of expenditure every month. We spend around 36 rupees on interest payments and another 18 rupees on defence. Our monthly income is around 80 rupees so we still borrow 20 rupees a month to make ends meet.

Asad’s mini-budget attempts to be pro-poor, pro-exporters (read industrialists) and tries to bring down the import bill in this challenging fiscal landscape. Yes, it hurts to have income taxes raised but the lowest income workers have been protected (and should continue to be protected by reducing indirect taxes). Gas and electricity prices have also been raised independent of the budget. While all of this sounds like Purana Pakistan, it’s actually good for the country. Asad has a thankless job at the moment but he’s doing the right thing. Much like a doctor forcing a drug addict to kick the habit, the next few months will be painful but Asad has taken the courageous way forward versus giving in to knee-jerk populist policies.

The only place where Asad deserves across-the-board criticism is for allowing non-filers to purchase real estate and cars. This is a step backwards and signals potential capture of the government by vested interests. The apparent reason — allowing overseas Pakistanis to make purchases — could have had other workarounds (hello NICOP). The energy and excitement going into raising funds for dams could have been channelled into getting Pakistanis to file taxes so we don’t have to beg every time the government needs money. For the first time, arguably in Pakistan’s history, people actually trust the government with their tax money. Now would be the time for a fresh start and encouraging people to pay and file taxes. The only way to break free from debt is to live within our means. Going to China or Saudi Arabia to avoid the IMF doesn’t cure our debt problem, it only masks the symptoms long enough for the problem to get worse.

The other critique of Asad Umar’s economic announcements has been how uninspiring and inside the box it’s been. This is true but partly unfair because of the state of the economy he inherited. One cannot expect a drug addict to find a job before he reforms his behaviour. It’s like saying a drug addict should just flip a switch and turn around his life. It’s not that easy.

Incredible, short-term pain is about to hit the Pakistani public if we want to get our finances in order and chart a path for growth. Subsidies on utilities will have to be eliminated slowly. A culture of tax paying will have to be nurtured. Jobs will have to be lost at public-sector companies to manage their haemorrhaging budgets. Once these interventions are made, we can move faster on our path to growth. The problem with Pakistan’s finances is that we always come to the brink and get saved by someone. If the drug addict is always rescued by family and never has his rock bottom moment of vomiting on the toilet floor trying to flush out his over- dose, the desire to change doesn’t come from within. The desire for change becomes circumstantial.

It’s important for leaders like Imran and Asad, who have the political and moral capital of being ‘clean’, to nurture a desire for genuine economic change in the country that is painful but worthwhile. If they don’t take the time to explain this to the Pakistani public, their reform plan will not have the political capital to sustain itself. It’s time to flush the addiction to debt and living beyond our means from Pakistan. That is the only path to foreign policy independence and sustainable economic growth.

NEW YORK: Sacha Baron Cohen is back and Sarah Palin is not amused. The US former vice presidential nominee and ex-Alaska governor has launched an extraordinary attack on the British comedian for duping her to take part in his new show.

“Ya’ got me, Sacha. Feel better now?” wrote the mother of five, once synonymous with the Tea Party movement on the far-right of the Republican Party.

Cohen, she said, “heavily disguised himself as a disabled US veteran, fake wheelchair and all,” for the interview that she was told was a “legit” historical documentary by pay-to-view American television network Showtime.

Sarah Palin says she doesn’t get sexually harassed because she carries a gun

“I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick ‘humor’ of the British ‘comedian’ Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime,” she wrote.

Palin said she ultimately walked out of the interview and slammed what she called the Cambridge-educated comedian’s “foreign commentaries” that disrespected the US military and middle-class Americans.

She called on Cohen, CBS and Showtime to donate all proceeds from the interview to charities that support American veterans.

In a final indignity, Palin accused the production team of “purposefully” dropping her and her daughter off at the wrong Washington airport, “knowing” they would miss their return flights back to Alaska.

Cohen first found fame in Britain in 2000 with “Da Ali G Show” that saw his wannabe rapper character interview unsuspecting public figures. The show later transferred across the Atlantic.

He followed a similar format with hit movie characters that include bumbling Kazakh reporter Borat and gay Austrian fashionista Bruno.

His latest venture “Who is America?” is a satirical half-hour seven-episode series that premieres this Sunday on Showtime.

386,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1693045/4-anwar-maqsoods-offensive-satire-sindhis-causes-online-outrage/,Anwar Maqsood’s offensive satire on Sindhis causes online outrage,2018-04-23,"‘Aik Sindhi Ka Interv­iew’ takes dig at their lavish lifest­yle, lazine­ss and indulg­ence in variou­s vices

KARACHI : Satire is the use of humour and ridicule to expose people’s flaws in the context of socio-politics and other contemporary issues. Add to it the fact that an artist using satire to talk about a society’s deep-rooted issues must have something intelligent to say and show them the mirror in a careful manner.

Veteran humourist and writer Anwar Maqsood released the latest episode of his online series titled Anwarnama on April 22 and it intended to be a satire on Sindhis. Titled Aik Sindhi Ka Interview, it shows Anwar reading a skit featuring him and a ‘common Sindhi’.

In an attempt to be funny, the episode starts off with the interviewer asking the Sindhi what he does for a living and he responds, “Nothing, I don’t need to work because I am Sindhi.” It then describes how the Sindhi man enjoys living a lavish lifestyle, indulges in various vices and in theory, dies multiple times in order to avoid paying off debt.

The episode irked the entire Sindhi population, here and abroad and caused a massive online backlash. Although it has now been removed from social media after Anwar publicly apologised, it merely goes on to show people’s attitude towards the Sindhi community.

Aik Sindhi Ka Interview comes off as offensive just for the sake of being offensive and it isn’t the least bit funny. The veteran had nothing important and intelligent to say and did not look at people in a critical manner but relegated to, intentionally or not, reinforce the stereotypes about Sindhis that have been consistent in Pakistani entertainment and media for years. This is the lowest common denominator of humour one didn’t expect from a legend like Anwar.

Talking to The Express Tribune, The Sketches front man Saif Samejo revealed that Anwar and Moin Akhtar had always been offensive, even back in the days of Loose Talk. “They had episodes where Akhtar appeared as a Bengali or Pashtun. It’s nothing new and I have been speaking out about this for years but no one cares,” he said. “Our media and films always showed a bandit wearing an ajrak, which is a sign of ultimate respect in our culture. Sindhis even welcomed immigrants during the time of Partition with an ajrak. Diversity is the strength of Sindh, which is the only diverse region in Pakistan.”

I’m 75 now. I want to retire: Anwar Maqsood

Saif continued, “I watched this recent episode and I don’t understand how one can call Sindhis jahil when you live in Sindh. You sit alongside him and a Sindhi accepts you as part of the community. Sindhi is not just a government worker or a certain political party supporter, he is also Sachal, he is also Bhittai. Sindh is also the land which welcomes everyone whether Christian, Hindu or anyone else.” He added that Anwar had a substandard mentality and that he was still caged in that old mindset. “You are in Sindh now and you are Sindhi too,” Saif retorted.

Comedian Ali Gul Pir reiterated that Loose Talk had a lot of controversial episodes. “But there was no sensitivity back then. Now it’s different. He doesn’t narrow it down to a government worker or anyone but generalises and says ‘aik Sindhi’. When the first joke you make is that he’s lazy, you are clearly reinforcing a stereotype,” he said. “When I made Wadere ka Beta, it was centered on Sindhi wadera, not all Sindhis. It was made clear. If there is a wadera villain in a film, it’s not racist because every story needs certain characters. The point is that distinction be made and there should be no generalisation.”

Ali mentioned he could find lazy people everywhere and not only in Sindh. “There is a way to go about criticising society or people. But what concerns me is that nobody else in his team saw the problem in this video. Why should a renowned artist reinforce the same stereotypical ideas and divide people when we are going past the ethnic and sectarian conflicts here.”

TV personality and politician Mahtab Akbar Rashdi criticised the timing of the video’s release. “Maqsood is an intellectual satirist and has a way of looking at things. But now at this juncture we are getting sensitive about so many things, about culture, language, etc and we are intolerant about so many things, and taking everything personally. In this scenario, releasing this video shows insensitivity,” she said. “People are taking it seriously and Maqsood should know that people are sensitive about certain things regarding the land of Sindh. It’s not intolerance but because of love for their land. Sindhis can’t compromise about anyone talking about Sindh. When it comes to their culture, land and water, there is no compromise.”

Mahtab continued, “This could have been easily ignored but not at this time. I know he makes fun of everyone but this is just rubbing salt in someone’s eyes. Not every Sindhi acts like he showed. You are targeting an entire nation of people. It’s not humor, its humiliation.”

Anwar Maqsood’s ‘Siachen’: Mastermind Dawar Mehmood is back – this time with Sajid Hasan

Director Institute of Sindhology Dr Ishaq Samejo said it showed a biased and narrow-minded view of people. “This video isn’t only against Sindhis, but also Urdu-speaking community. It’s just trying to create a divide between us and this attitude is condemnable,” he said. “Sindhis have always been welcoming and loving towards others. For me, Maqsood hasn’t only diminished his status as a writer but also a human.” Ishaq called the episode “a third-rate satire, if it can be called satire at all,” and said that one of the founding fathers and statesman Liaquat Ali Khan initiated this attitude, which has now become a mindset. “He called Sindhi culture that of donkey-carts and the language of illiterates and uneducated. This is the privileged class whose attitude has prevailed for so long and is not acceptable.”

Director Benazir Bhutto Chair at University of Karachi, Sahar Gul, likened this attitude to a form of narcissism. “It’s a form of narcissism that my language, sect or culture is supreme. It leads to curbing of diversity and the last stage is that if you’re not like me, you should be killed. If he (Maqsood) had used the word Sindhi wadera, it could have been tolerated.” She said, “We are proud of our rural areas where agriculture is a big part of our country and our people. This is a social responsibility of the literati they should condemn the killers of the community, and remove bias from the community. But they don’t do this.”

Initially defending the video, Anwar said he had lived in Sindh since he came in 1948 and he respected all the greats and even knew some personally. In the video, he is seen holding a copy of Shah Jo Risalo and apologising to everyone for hurting their sentiments. “It worried me that I hurt people’s sentiments. I don’t belong to any political party and I knew Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari. Sindh is a land of love, where Sachal and Bhittai lived,” he said. “I apologise to everyone that my humour hurt my Sindhi brothers’ sentiments.”

Anwar Maqsood is a bigger and better writer than Woody Allen: Sajid Hasan

Anwar’s timely apology must be appreciated as he realised and retracted the video to fix the mistake. But the larger picture shows that the cause of concern isn’t only this video but that this attitude towards the Sindhi community has been going on for years. Comedy has been used to reflect on society for so long and it has the right to be offensive but only when it has something of value to say. I would personally be on board if Anwar’s piece was at least funny and painted a true picture of a common Sindhi or had done away with generalising the entire community. It’s like making a stereotypical Pathan joke. In this day and age, it’s not only unfunny, but rather crude and perhaps only has a place in local stage shows which feed on this low-taste comedy. It isn’t something one would expect from someone with a stature that Anwar enjoys.

Times are changing and today, even the slightest error can mount up to be a bigger issue. This small negligence, which could have been easily avoided on part of the veteran humourist, exposed the plethora of issues concerning stereotypical representation of Sindhis in local media.

Go out of our comfort zone and you realise, just like in every nation, there are people who are good, motivated, hardworking as well as lazy and corrupt. As Saif pointed out on Twitter that it wasn’t only about Anwar or Akhtar but about the venomous mindset that is prevalent. “Since we grew up, we have been seeing such a wrong image (of Sindhis) and every age has to prove that we aren’t like what you portray us to be. Pakistan needs to revisit Sindh and feel (and understand) what ‘Sindhyat’ really is.”

KARACHI: We are living in a time when reality seems to be in competition with satire – decimating the benchmark of what we hold true.

In a world of Trump and the Onion, it is tough to distinguish between truth and satire – sometime even a disclaimer fails to do the job. In a bid to find validation for their theories, people are open to believing everything they see and hear. The number of likes has become equivalent to proof of authenticity.

#MeToo talk pushes aside issue of harassment

So how does one follow? A panel comprising Zarrar Khuhro and Fasi Zaka discussed the phenomena in a session titled ‘Reality Catches up with Satire’, moderated by Nadeem Farooq Paracha at the ninth Karachi Literature Festival on Saturday.

“It’s impossible to keep up, reality has taken over satire,” Khuhro said. “We have to lower our standards of comedy to keep up with reality.”

When an audience member recalled the statement of Pakistan Peoples Party Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari vowing to bring back stolen money, Zarrar quipped, “This is genius! How do you top that?”

Highlighting a major problem with satire today, Zaka said we are now punching down at victims instead of punching up at the powerful. He explained that in the 1980s the target was General Ziaul Haq but today it was protesters at Faizabad.

“We have a base of people who largely agree with us,” he said. “We believe we are converting the other side but you cannot convert people by making fun of them.”

Paracha wondered whether gullibility was becoming the norm today. Khuhro’s opinion seemed to differ as he pointed out that opinions which were once confined to drawing rooms have been provided a public platform through social media. “People have always been the same; we were never patient.”

He argued that it was not an anomaly to say or do things that made little sense when you are young. The only difference is that there is no permanent record of us being ‘stupid’ on a public platform, he said.

Universities – a breeding ground for terrorists?

Speaking to The Express Tribune about the repercussions of using sarcasm to weigh in on issues, Khuhro said, “The speed at which your views are disseminated is much faster now – an ordinary person using Twitter can potentially reach an audience of millions, hence the backlash is magnified.”

The creeping self-censorship in the age of outrage has curtailed our ability to take on the ironies of today. Zaka believes most satirists are not doing their job to the fullest. “We have internalised some of the censorship rules,” he told The Express Tribune. “The satire we do is punching at the sanctioned people or institutions that we can make fun of, which usually serves a purpose of other institutions who are actually acting in fairly undemocratic fashion.”

Zaka was of the view that it was not the thought of offending the masses that was responsible for self-censorship, rather it was ‘the systematic state actions’ against those using satire to depict reality that sent a strong signal. “You may like it or not but it [the work] was nowhere in the realm of treason,” he said.

LONDON: British satirist Armando Iannucci has won critical praise in Britain for his latest film – a darkly comic look at the power struggle to succeed Joseph Stalin – but in Russia not all politicians share the joke.

One communist politican branded it “abominable filth.” “The Death of Stalin,” which stars Steve Buscemi, Jeffrey Tambor and Jason Isaacs, held its UK premiere on Tuesday night. As the title suggests, it features a scene depicting the Soviet dictator’s demise in 1953.

Russia invited to explore untapped Pakistan market

“The comedy is about what’s going on inside the Kremlin, the power struggle, you know, the frantic kind of fight for survival really,” Iannucci told Reuters.

“That’s where the comedy comes and the paranoia that’s going on as well. But the consequences of these people’s actions is what ripples out across the Soviet Union – we show that for real.”

There has been no comment from the Kremlin about the film. But communist members of the Russian parliament are calling for a ban on its release in Russia. Russian Communist party spokesperson Alexander Yushchenko, himself a parliamentarian, described the film as “abominable filth,” in an interview cited by the party’s website.

“Today’s support – including for Stalin and (state founder Vladimir) Lenin – is on the rise, first and foremost among young people,” he said. The film as yet does not have a Russian release date listed on the film industry website IMDB.com.

Russia supplying free fuel to Taliban in war against NATO forces, reveals report

Sergei Obukhov, another senior member of the Russian communist party, drew a similar conclusion saying the film was “a new form of psychological warfare against our country.” Stalin ruled Russia for three decades during which he is widely held responsible for the deaths of millions of people, many in the Gulag network of labour camps.

The image of the dictator appears to be going through something of a rehabilitation in Russia though. A poll by the Russia’s Levada Centre in June found that respondents considered Stalin the “most outstanding person” in history, followed by present-day president, Vladimir Putin. Iannucci has won dozens of awards for his foul-mouthed political comedies “The Thick Of It” and “Veep”, which centre on dysfunctional politicians in Britain and the United States

respectively.

Egyptian comedian, Bassem Youssef, has created a way to combat Islamophobia for Muslims across America called the “Muslim morning after kit”, reported Huffington Post.

Youssef, who is also termed “Egyptian Jon Stewart” is a terrific satirist, and he teamed up with entertainment site CAFÉ to bring Muslims the perfect gateway to protection against suspicion and discrimination. The kit is an innovative way to protect American Muslims “from anyone who may want to hurt you because they think you vaguely resemble a terrorist.”

Egypt’s inclusion to boost CPEC, says NA speaker

The parody video sheds light on the way in which racial stereotypes have endangered people, and the fact that Muslims encounter such stereotypes on a daily basis. The ‘kit’ includes American flags “to drape all over your house every direction,” a t-shirt that says, “one of the good ones”, and an audio exercise CD that help users sound more ‘white.’

In addition, Youssef has also included in his ‘kit’ a photo with the country singer Toby Keith, and a backpack patch that says, “just some books and a laptop.” The kit also comes with an audio recording keychain with phrases in it resembling, “I hereby condemn yesterday’s terrorist attack, and all terrorist attacks. Bye bye!”

Youssef added that the kit also comes with a “White flight” application that detects the location of people who have posted ‘alt-right’ Facebook statuses or joined such groups on Reddit. “If whites get close, you’ll know to take a flight as quickly as possible,” he adds.

Interestingly, this kit isn’t only reserved for the Muslims, but also those who ‘look’ like them. This kit is called “Vaguely Muslim-Looking Morning after kit.”

Visa for Egyptians aimed at preventing ‘terrorists’: Sudan

In addition to producing this satirical skewering of Islamophobia, Youssef has become the subject of a new documentary, “Tickling Giants,” chronicling his life as a persecuted political commentator in Egypt.

I am a lawyer who decided to be a comedian. I never thought my two worlds would collide so perfectly one day. I have used all of my legal knowledge and gone through the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) recently revealed report and now, I am going to translate it into Pakistani – a language all of us understand.

The JIT was formed to find what the sources of funds are

Translation: We wanted everybody to know conclusively how the Sicilian mafia works before making any decision. Hey – we are the Supreme Court – when have we ever taken haste in dismissing a government or legitimising an illegal government? We are completely independent of politics – look at JIT to keep you occupied!

The affidavits of Tariq Shafi are unreliable. His signatures are different

Translation: How lazy are you man? If you were going to forge documents, you should have at least signed all of them yourself. You made other people sign! You truly do live like a king.

The Ahli Steel Mills document does not exist

Translation: Nawaz Sharif claims his dog ate his office work.

Tariq Shafi said Shehbaz Sharif was involved. Shehbaz Sharif said he was not involved

Translation: Aah… another case of he said, Shah said – Shehbaz Sharif is lying and trying to ensure he does not go down with his brother. He is building an underpass for himself to get out of this flood but he will drown with the rest of them.

As ministers bash JIT, PM confers with top aides

No document proving business started with 100% loan

Translation: Chori ka paisa hoga.

The liabilities of Gulf Steel were cleared possibly through undeclared wealth

Translation: Please refer to the aforementioned chori ka paisa.

No document shown to prove how money reached Qatar, Jeddah, or UK

Translation: The Sharif family is engaged in something that rhymes with funny maundering – yes, it is money laundering. You win nothing – just like the Sharif family from this JIT.

The liabilities repayment would have wiped out any sale proceeds

Translation: Chori ka paisa + chori ka paisa – chori ka paisa x chori ka paisa = chori ka paisa.

Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif during his address to the nation stated that in 1980 this factory (Gulf Steel Mills) was sold for AED 33.7 million. This is not consistent with either the documents/records provided by the respondents or the findings of the JIT

Translation: So, if anybody wants to file an application declaring him to be not ‘sadiq and ameen’ and not fit to be a prime minister, we are ready to hear you out.

Moreover, no Imran Khan, we do not mean physically, is fit to be the premier – stop with the push-ups already.

Respondents story about Gulf is unauthentic, lacks substance and seems fabricated

Translation: Just like everything else they say – ye bhi jhoot hay.

JIT suggests filing NAB reference against Sharif family

Sales proceeds from Gulf Steel Mills never reached Jeddah, Qatar or UK

Translation: The Sharif family should have at least pretended they won “Who Wants to a Millionaire” a few hundred times.

The beneficial owner of the Neilson Enterprises Limited and the Nescoll Limited is Maryam Safdar

Translation: The Sharif family should have thought about protecting Maryam when they were distributing properties in London like it was candy to all of their children.

Maryam has submitted fake/falsified documents to the JIT, which is a criminal offence. Mr Hussain Nawaz and Captain Safdar have also signed these documents

Translation: At least the Sharifs will have company in jail.

Comprehensive report duly signed by Robert W. Radley(Radley Forensic Document Laboratory) London “I have identified the type font used to produce both certified declarations to be “Calibri”. However, “Calibri” was not commercially available before 31st January 2007 and as such, neither of the originals of the certified Declarations is correctly dated and happy to have been created at some later point in time”

Translation: The Sharifs clearly did not learn in school that ‘naql’ kay liye bhi ‘aqal’ chaiye hoti hay.

Mr Nawaz distanced himself from the apartments

Translation: Even the father who gave them the property does not want to get involved in the mess. Is the court to believe Hussain Nawaz invented Facebook and became a billionaire while he was a teenager thus was able to afford all these properties?

Complete JIT report on Sharifs’ offshore properties

Repeated changes in Hussain Nawaz’s stance indicates possible efforts to conceal facts

Translation: Jhoot pakra gaya.

True owners of the Sharif family were the Sharif family – Nawaz seems to employ his children and two BVI entities to conceal his true ultimate ownership

Translation: Like you know, like every wealthy Pakistani father.

“Mr Hasan Nawaz, in his statement before the JIT, explained that Mr Hussain Nawaz Sharif had sent him 2.4 million GBP to help him set his business without declaring the source where the money was coming from”

Translation: 324386304.00 Pakistani rupees. We are sure Hussain Nawaz earned this through his tech start-up. Sure 320 million can sustain thousands of livelihoods for years in Pakistan but it is peanuts for the Sharif family.

Hasan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz did not have any independent source of income till 2000

Translation: Yet he was distributing millions like Edhi.

Shahbaz Sharif’s reluctance to discuss Qatari letters

Translation: The junior Sharif thinks he will be able to get out of this sinking ship, or at least Hamza will be the next chief minister of Punjab but we are onto him. He goes down with the rest of him.

Al Thani Family did not own the Mayfair apartments

Translation: Qatar cannot even save them now.

Confirmation of fictitious sale/purchase agreements by the respondents

Translation: Yeh bik gayi hai gormint.

The basic summary of the JIT recommendations is that sab hie chor hain, sab hie jhootay hain.

391,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1437071/myanmar-editor-facing-trial-posting-satirical-article-defaming-military/,Myanmar editor facing trial for posting satirical article defaming military,2017-06-16,"Activi­sts say variou­s defama­tion laws are being used to stifle free speech­

YANGON, MYANMAR: The editor of one of Myanmar’s top newspapers will face trial for defaming the military by posting a satirical article on Facebook, under a controversial law critics say is stifling press freedom.

Myanmar anti-Islam monk says barred from Facebook

Last month the army sued the editor in chief of The Voice, Kyaw Min Swe, for uploading a link to an article poking fun at the military’s leaders for sitting around talking while ordinary soldiers are killed. On Friday a court in Yangon sent him to the city’s notorious Insein prison to await the start of his trial next week.

Hopes had been high that Myanmar’s first freely elected government in generations would usher in a new era of free speech when they took power last year after half a century of military rule. But defamation prosecutions have soared since Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) came to power, with social media satirists, activists and journalists increasingly targeted.

Activists say various defamation laws are being used to stifle free speech and stop the media from criticising the government.

Kyaw Min Swe is being prosecuted under the country’s broadly-worded telecommunications law — known as “66(d)” — which forbids uploading false of defamatory information online. If convicted he faces up to six months in jail.

The writer of the article, Kyaw Swa Naing, was acquitted by the court on Friday because he did not actually upload his piece. Speaking to reporters outside court, he said the law “must be amended”.

“Journalists are being harmed very much. Although we do not know what the verdict will be for brother Kyaw Min Swe… he’s now being held in prison,” he added.

Dozens of journalists and free speech activists wearing white armbands and with painted faces protested near the court on Friday, displaying banners emblazoned with “press freedom” in red.

“The government is letting people and organisations sue journalists… using a (law) that should be abolished under the NLD,” protesters Phyo Wai said.

Facebook ‘ban’ of anti-Muslim slur sparks Myanmar outcry

The Voice article at the centre of the case poked fun at a military propaganda film called “Pyi Daung Su Thit Sar” (Faithful to the Union) lauding the army’s victories over armed ethnic groups.

It was released just weeks before the start of the government’s latest round of tense peace negotiations with Myanmar’s myriad insurgent groups, and as some of the heaviest fighting in decades rages in border areas.

The run-up to Pakistan’s upcoming general elections next year have taken an interesting turn, as election campaigns of Pakistan’s leading political parties have been leaked. Read the proposed pathways of PML-N, PTI, PPP and others to their possible victories and pick your winner.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)

Politics is temporary but Biryani is forever. We survived the past five years and so did you, let’s survive five more together. No more Panama, only nara pajama.

We promise to make more roads and import fancy buses to make it seem like the country is progressing. Look at all our metro buses; we are the most metrosexual party ever. Load-shedding will be over by 2019 promise, pinky promise.

No JIT can bring us down. Unless it is more than two hours, then Hussain Nawaz gets tired.

Elections 2018: ‘Make resolution of people’s issues a priority’

Just don’t look at all these flats we are buying around the world – those are just in case papa decides democracy time is over and we all need to stop pretending. Load-shedding will be over by 2020 promise, pinky promise. Maryam Nawaz > Hamza Shahbaz.

Promise everything and deliver nothing. Load-shedding will be over by 2021 promise, pinky promise.

When you’re with us, you’re family. Do your corruption. Do your murders. Do your terrorism. As long as nobody reports about anything, we won’t care. Just continue voting for us. As long as we have Punjab, we have nothing to worry about.

Remember when Shahbaz said he would drag Asif Ali Zardari through the streets? You have to give us five more years if you want to see that happen – we are saving that for the DVD special. Maryam Nawaz’s twitter > Imran Khan’s twitter

Load-shedding will be over by 2099 promise, pinky promise.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)

Imran Khan is neither Asif Ali Zardari nor Nawaz Sharif. Wait, what? You need more reasons to vote for us? Well, do we need to stand for anything when we can simply stand against everything?

The only tabdeeli that comes is the one in our political positions.

We have figured out what you don’t want. We have no idea what you want or how to even give it to you but, we agree with you that we don’t want what you don’t want as well so, we are on the same page then. All we know is that tabdeeli is coming; we have no idea what will happen when it is here.

How PML-N’s trying to win voter support in 2018 elections

Nobody cares if our party has the same guys as all the other parties just look at how beautiful Imran Khan is and he is single again. Nobody was going to vote for a 64-year-old married man.

Are you an electable? JOIN PTI! We can deal with your criminal records; corruption and complete lack of principles later, just get elected for now.

We will fight corruption because Imran Khan isn’t corrupt. Such logic, much wow.

We will fight terrorism because Imran Khan isn’t a terrorist.

We will fight India because Imran Khan isn’t an Indian.

So, basically just forget all policy and agenda items and just look at Imran Khan. Do you like what you see? Vote for us then! You don’t even need to know our names, just vote for the bat.

Also, the best jalsas. By far.

Don’t trust Javed Hashmi when he says the plan is to get two-three people killed. Trust us, we cannot win an election by just getting two-three people killed, more like 20-30 maybe.

Also Twitter trolls. So, so, so, many Twitter trolls. Facebook ka Prime Minister is a legit position ok.

Pakistan People’s Party (PPP)

Have you all forgotten the period of 2008 to 2013? Great! Then we are back again. Let’s pretend Asif Ali Zardari was never the president.

You know how sometimes you have a headache but then you get cancer for a few years and you forget that you ever had a headache because cancer hurts so much now? Well, the headache is back and after cancer, it doesn’t seem that bad.

Also look at how shiny Bilawal Bhutto is. He even speaks Urdu now – or what he thinks is Urdu. In the next update, we will also try to make him speak Sindhi.

Nawaz Sharif foreseen to win 2018 polls: report

Want to know what he stands for and what his policies are? He is Benazir’s son and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s grandson. Want to know what PPP will do once the party comes into power? Have we told you who Bilawal’s mother and grandfather are?

What are going to be our major campaign ideas? What? Do you want me to draw the Bhutto family tree for you? Also, we have the best political song. Admit it – you want to dance to it on your mehndi also. And of course, the most holidays because we have the most shaheeds.

Make Pakistan great again. Go back to the days when we got 10% of everything.

Also Zinda hay Bilawal – wait it was a secret Zardari strategy that was not supposed to be leaked.

Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)

We exist. No promise we are still a political reality. Remember the days we complained that we had our backs against the wall? Well now that we are giving Anarkali Company inside the wall that doesn’t seem that bad.

BUT…hey look at how we were victimised, if nothing else, have some sympathy and give us your cell phones, I mean votes. I swear, we meant votes.

Musharraf likely to contest 2018 general elections

Why are you even looking for campaign ideas? When have we ever had any? Just look at what your identity is and vote for it. If you don’t, we will send our karkun and they will vote on your behalf.

Also, don’t forget to take your CNICs back from us the day after elections. We can’t keep them forever – or maybe we can till, at least, the next Skype call from London.

We go from the wall to your Facebook wall. You know you want to share that cute Altaf Hussain video. The only thing more popular than puppies on social media are Altaf Bhai’s pappis – ek pappi idhar, ek pappi udhar.

Awami Muslim League (AML)

When you can buy the milk, why buy the Buffalo?

Jamaat-i-Islami (JI)

Look, we are PTI’s ally so we can’t be that bad right? And we are Islamic so if you are Muslim, you must vote for us.

We at least have an agenda. We oppose capitalism, communism, liberalism, socialism, secularism and Miley Cyrus. Mainly, Miley Cyrus – she has been used by the West as a wrecking ball against Pakistan. So what if Maududi opposed Jinnah and Pakistan. Pakistan exists now and we want some of that cake too now that it has been made.

Also, free ice cream for all the women (bought by their mehrams for them).

And no uncovered lollypops. Ever. Everyone except us is a kafir.

Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F)

What is our agenda? Depends – how much are you willing to pay?

Say no to Petrol. Only Diesel.

393,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1412053/sneak-peak-cpec-master-plan/,A sneak peak into the ‘CPEC Master Plan’,2017-05-18,"Karach­i will soon be called China Town under CPEC

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was recently in China to participate in the ‘One Belt, One Road’ summit, which is ironic since his name and the word belt have never been used in the same sentence before. Many people have to tie two belts together and a nara with izarband each time when choosing to wear a suit. The struggle is real, people, especially for our respected premier.

At great risk to my personal well-being, I somehow managed to stick my hand in the pocket of PM Nawaz’s suit shalwar and pull out the longest term plan for the China-Pak Economic Dumbledore, I mean Corridor. I uttered Dumbledore first because the way China has convinced us that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a game-changer for Pakistan has to be magic. I would not be surprised if Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang tried giving Nawaz some ‘love potion’ the last time they met. There is a reason why their love is higher than the mountains and deeper than the seas, you know.

Pakistan highly attractive destination for investment: PM Nawaz

And guess what… the CPEC master plan revelations are truly shocking.

The Shan (soon to be called Shan-Ghai masalay) advertisement was just the start. The Chinese are planning to replace every kind of Biryani (mind you) in Pakistan with Chicken Manchurian. In many ways, the master plan is exactly like the advertisement; to lure neighbours into friendship with food. When the loving dadi in the advertisement tells the Chinese woman, “Isko apna hee ghar samjho”, she just smiles knowing that that was her plan all along.

You know Nawaz Sharif is involved when all it took to win people over was a plate of biryani – this is basically how he took office.

The CPEC master plan has a simple proposal for agriculture which can be summarised in just four words: We grow, they eat. Everyone who once laughed at the Chinese people for eating dogs will not be laughing anymore when they will end up eating all our crops.

The Chinese idea to increase agricultural exports to one of the most water-stressed countries in the world is genius! If all the water goes to the crops then none of the water will be left for drinking, which will cure all our population-related problems.

If the, soon to be implemented, one child per house Chinese policy does not seem to work in Pakistan then the scarcity of water will do the trick – and please. Don’t worry about how so many Chinese will fit in Pakistan because dil mai jaga honi chaiye, yaar.

China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: ‘Long-term plan’ to be inked soon

According to the plan, Karachi’s new name will be “China Town” and, in a reversal of fortune, Karachi will be the name of a restaurant in China Town. Lahore is to be called Lo Ho Ping, Gwadar is to be named Lo A Gaye Hum and Islamabad’s new name is Char Jao Ab Ling.

It is unclear what punishment the Chinese will give to those who shut down Chinese parlours in Islamabad. All the popular religious parties, who claimed communist parties could never win elections in Pakistan, are reportedly re-evaluating their beliefs.

The Chinese are also producing a sequel to the movie ‘Chalay thay saath’ now called ‘Chalay thay saath billion’. The movie revolves around sending the entire Chinese population into Pakistan and ends with the region being surrounded by the Great Wall of China. It is obviously fiction… for now.

The full surveillance system will ensure that Pakistanis do not do to the Great Wall of China what they do to every wall in the country. Huge sign boards saying saying ‘Great Wall of China par peshab karna mana hay’. In Mandarin. But that will not be a problem because soon it will be mandatory for all Pakistanis to learn Mandarin. The process has already started at primary schools.

The CPEC master’s master plan also reveals the internet in Pakistan will be replaced by cat videos. It envisions a deep and broad based penetration – which is what most Pakistani teenage boys also envision when they use the internet. No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram; the internet will just be billions and billions of cat videos.

The aim is replicate the calm that the people of Pakistan had when PTV was the only channel available. Just like Ayub Khan had videos of tractors everywhere. Even when the country was on the verge of a disaster, the nation remained calm because they watched videos teaching them how to drive tractors. What was the country’s domestic policy, you ask? People don’t know because when Pakistanis are driving tractors they are not thinking about the domestic policy.

In the same way, instead of worrying about their civil liberties and fundamental rights people will watch cat videos. The cuteness of the videos will distract them enough to forget about everything else.

394,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1410222/guide-pakistani-parents-kill-childs-curiosity/,A guide for Pakistani parents: How to kill your child’s curiosity,2017-05-16,"A helpfu­l guide brough­t to you by the Pakist­an Parent­ing Associ­ation

A helpful guide brought to you by the Pakistan Parenting Association.

Most smart parents know that too much curiosity is a bad thing. Raising a child, especially an inquisitive one, is quite a challenge. We want our child to grow up to be a practical, well-to-do individual with an aura of respect and prestige. We don’t want them to become writers, artists or — Allah-na-keray — philosophers.

Here are a few ways you can keep those pesky questions to the minimum, and raise a successful, practical offspring who will conform to societal standards and make you proud!

1) Protect yourself first

Much like the instruction for oxygen masks on airplanes — protect yourself first, then protect your child. Try not to get yourself sucked into the curiosity trap, and try not to learn too much about the world — the more you know, the more you realize that you know very little, which in turn makes you curious, not unlike the child you are trying to discipline.

Every now and then, you may find yourself in a weak moment, contemplating a new idea for the sake of understanding the world. This is precisely the dangerous behavior you are trying to protect your child from.

Project for out-of-school children launched in Islamabad

Entertaining strange new ideas is like substance abuse — it’s very easy to get carried away. If you aren’t careful, you’ll find yourself interrogating your decades-old, firmly held beliefs that you’ve fought hard to keep intact; beliefs that have now become part of your identity. And your identity is your source of pride, so protect it at all cost.

2) Nip it in the bud

Don’t leave your child’s questions unattended. Childhood curiosity can be tenacious. Not answering the question right away only means the question will pop up again. Now, imagine if you were not around when the question came up. Other adults may encourage your child’s curiosity, or worse, answer your child’s question in a way that is unacceptable to you. The trick, therefore, is to think on your feet, and come up with an easily digestible answer the first time itself. Just make sure the answer does not contradict another unrelated answer you had given earlier. If you do this, be prepared for a volley of questions, precisely what you were avoiding.

Helpful tip: Don’t worry about being logical or realistic. Being the parent, you can literally make your child believe anything you want without much evidence or logic. Use your position in the relationship to your advantage.

3) Obedience

Your most important weapon in the fight against curiosity is obedience. This is a trait you need to inculcate in your child as early as possible. It’ll make things a lot easier for you, your child, and all the authority figures your child will be subjected to in the future — teachers, school administrators, religious authority figures, the government, the police, and the military. For a society, as for a family, to keep functioning the way it’s functioning without disruption, we need obedience. If it wasn’t for obedient children who grew up to become subservient adults, would Pakistan have made the remarkable progress that it has?

Footpath School children in Karachi dance their hearts out

Helpful tip: If you are a father, it helps to think of yourself as the ‘head of state’ and your offspring as the ‘subject’. Own the position — protect it, and make sure you and your position remain significant for a long time. If you are the mother, you are the deputy of the ‘head of state’. Your job is to always support your husband. If you have a difference of opinion with him, just ignore it, and set a good example for your child of how to be obedient.

Another helpful tip: Do not ever apologise if you make a mistake — it undermines your authority as a parent. In fact, according to some thinkers, it’s not a mistake if your heart was in the right place, and as parents, your heart is always in the right place. That’s just a fact. If you cannot resist the urge to apologise, make sure you downplay the mistake, and never use the words ‘mistake’, ‘sorry’ or ‘apologize’.

4) Use the fear of rejection

Tell your child that publicly questioning conventional beliefs will draw ridicule from relatives, friends, and coworkers. If they question things too much, they may even be ostracized. Even if they do so privately, questioning fundamental beliefs can trigger an existential crisis, which, as we all know, leads quickly to suicide. Give them examples of European philosophers, many of whom committed the grave sin of suicide because they wouldn’t stop questioning things.

So, it is best to be safe and not question things at all. Only accept new ideas if they, beyond doubt, support your existing ideas and worldview.

5) School

Don’t worry too much about what your child studies at school; most schools have evolved to feed information to and discipline future job seekers. Even that’s something they struggle to achieve in Pakistan, so there isn’t much to worry about.

Three children used as drug mules rescued

There is a reason schools focus on Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Math and English as opposed to Sociology, Government, Politics, Philosophy and Anthropology. The former are practical subjects that prepare workers of the future to secure jobs and support their families. The latter only get them worked up and upset about perfectly normal things like strictly-defined gender roles.

Occasionally, however, you may come across an idealistic principal or a teacher who has a liberal arts background. They may encourage the inquisitive nature of your child, so avoid educators and schools that have an idealistic inclination.

6) University

Another problematic situation arises when your child is ready to go to university. They may not agree with what you’ve decided for them to study, and may put up resistance. This usually happens if they have gained some emotional and intellectual independence, i.e. they feel it is okay for them to entertain ideas that they know you won’t approve of. This is dangerous territory.

If your child says they want to study literature, philosophy or sociology, you know you’re in trouble. Use whatever tactic you can to dissuade them. If they win, be prepared to deflect questions about your child’s career from inquisitive guests and relatives at weddings and iftar parties. While they go on and on about their son’s amazing job at Unilever, you’ll be struggling to recall what exactly your child does at the newspaper.

To avoid this situation be vigilant from the time your child is born. Keep idealistic relatives away from your child, and be especially vigilant of the child’s older cousins and friends. A category we often take for granted are science geeks — they are practical, smart and usually have jobs, but their ideas can encourage young people to be skeptical, to question conventional thinking, and to stop being intellectually complacent. Engineering graduates in Pakistan typically do not fall into this category, so don’t worry about them.

Find a university for your child that does not admit students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, or other categories of people you would not want your child to end up marrying. Exposure to the class system can also make a young adult become aware of the glaring inequality in society, and encourage them to question things. Stick with private universities where the environment is devoid of political thought, and students come from largely similar, well-to-do backgrounds. These universities regularly arrange pointless events to keep students busy, and give them a sense of belonging.

Helpful tip: If you feel that the university is too open-minded, or there is too much inter-gender mingling, or the girls are not appropriately dressed, gather other parents and approach the university management. Since you are paying the tuition fee, you are the university’s ultimate customer, not your child. No one understands this better than the university management.

7) Marriage

Try to get your daughters married soon after they graduate from university, and your sons as soon as they find a stable job (unless you need either of them to support you financially). Being unmarried with newfound independence may give your child space to contemplate and entertain interesting new questions, like ‘Why do people have children?’. Be mindful of what they are doing with their income; for example, if they buy too many books, you’re in trouble. So plan ahead and keep your son or daughter occupied with major life events, like their wedding, their first child, their second child… you get the picture.

Helpful tip: Although your child becomes an adult at the age of 18 and can legally do everything that adults can, like owning property, getting married to whoever they choose, and fighting for the country, it is advisable to not highlight the fact that they are now independent adults, much like yourself. Keep using the words larka and larki — as opposed to aadmi and aurat — to refer to young adults, until they get married and have two kids of their own, or until they start looking like they’re 37.

Remember that only the most obedient, practical and self-centered children will make it to the top in our society, bringing their parents immense pride and joy.

395,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1410238/tv-show-black-mirror-based-pakistan/,If the TV show ‘Black Mirror’ was based in Pakistan,2017-05-16,"The Britis­h televi­sion show deals with the realit­ies of our modern world and we can relate it to Pakist­ani societ­y

KARACHI : Whenever writers, film-makers or artists have explored the idea of a dystopian society, they always talk about it with reference to the future. We always think the worst is yet to come. In a paradoxical antithesis of the idea of hope, we most importantly want to feel safe in the here and now. “It’s alright so far,” we say. But what if it’s not? What if we are merely pretending that it is? What if the future is now and we don’t have to be afraid of the unpleasantness of the future dystopian world because we already live in it and as shocking as it may be, we are comfortable in it.

The increasing anger and frustration of this segmented world, the boiling paranoia of everything we don’t understand, and the technological invasion of our lives has turned us into the very creatures we read about in dystopian literature and feel afraid. “We are not them,” we say. But what if we are?

Gender equality: Educating women a must for enlightened society: Shehbaz

British television show Black Mirror deals with all the realities of our modern world and how we have become what we said we never would: paranoid humanoids who would steal someone’s oxygen to keep themselves alive. We have become the kind who inhales fear and exhales disgust. We live in a world where mob mentality overrules any laws and regulations. In literary dystopias, it is most often the government who is the controlling evil. But in today’s dystopia, it is the people. Mob mentality prevails and sanity is buried somewhere thousands of miles under the mine-filled land of distrust, hatred, and blind rage.

An interesting fact about Black Mirror is that it, in its own twisted way, predicted Trump’s presidency and even told a story of a fictional British prime minister having a ‘very’ close relationship with a pig. Coincidentally, knowledge of an uncorroborated anecdote between actual former British PM David Cameron and a pig was later made public. While the television show has made interesting social commentary on today’s perverted world, we wonder how it would look if it was made in Pakistan. If anything, recent happenings in the country have offered more than a glimpse of the bitter society we live in, and it would be interesting to see how the show’s creator Charlie Brooker would tackle them.

We discuss six recent happenings in Pakistan that would make for brilliant Black Mirror episodes.

We are Mashal Khan: Civil society comes out in support of slain university student

1) Qandeel Baloch’s life

Call her an attention-seeking wannabe model or a symbol for unapologetic independent women, Qandeel Baloch’s life surely fits the bill for a Black Mirror episode. It’s unsurprising, yet interesting to see how social media can change and even end lives. It was social media which hyped, mocked, and made Baloch a celebrity for no reason. It was social media that inadvertently caused her demise. We don’t even need to add fictional elements to make it a Black Mirror episode. A simple biopic with emphasis on the role of the internet and how its influence destroys lives is enough to make us reflect, at least temporarily, on our careless behaviour when we are anonymous. “We didn’t do it. They did,” we say.

2) Mashal Khan incident

The fact that Mashal Khan was brutally murdered not by the ‘lesser educated’ (generally believed to be more extremist-adjacent) but rather his own fellow university students and faculty, is evidence enough that education and technology don’t change man’s inherently violent nature. If anything, it merely enhances it and gives it different ways to implement it. We have moved on from swords and spears to guns and missiles. Yet, Khan’s story reminds us of our animal nature where a quick death isn’t enough to satisfy us.

It’s a classic case of mob mentality overpowering the general rules of a civilised society.

Imagine a world where it was legal for people to murder and maim anyone they perceive as guilty of a crime. What would become of the society where purging of sanity was encouraged?

Mardan university student accused of blasphemy beaten to death on campus

3) Yasir Hussain’s child molestation joke

Yasir Hussain caught heat when he made his life’s biggest mistake by joking about child molestation at a recent award’s show. Sitting comfortable in his home, he apologised and was largely forgiven. A couple of weeks later, the incident is largely forgotten as we dwell on our latest obsession. With our short attention spans, that’s what we do. We raise our voice on one issue, forget about it the next day and move on. But what if those twitter warriors were actually willing to go farther than typing 140 characters?

PHOTO: FILE

Imagine a world where governments don’t exist and all conflicts are solved by public trials where angry people decide what to do. Hussain would not go forgiven from the trial, even after hundreds of apologies. It’s cruel to imagine what would come of him, but it won’t be a surprise, given this is the direction we’re headed toward as a society.

4) Waqar Zaka’s beatdown

This may seem eerily similar to Black Mirror’s ’15 Million Merits’ episode from the first season. Television ratings and online views are all the rage. Brands, corporate companies and channels are willing to spend money on anything that goes viral. In the aforementioned episode, Bing’s rant about being sick of the slave-like society powered by ratings and constant distraction through entertainment shockingly earns him a television show of his own. Zaka’s incident may or may not have earned him sympathy or a new television show (along with his attacker), but it did earn him thousands of views, which translate as free publicity. It served as a good distraction for people and now it’s largely forgotten about. What if the entire episode with Zaka, his beatdown, and the eventual resolution of the conflict with his attacker landed him a series? It would not be far-fetched to think it could happen. In this day and age, free publicity (positive or negative) is like winning a jackpot. You’re sure to become popular for 15 minutes, or could end up drowning in your 15 million rupees.

5) Naureen Laghari

A medical student, Naureen Laghari made headlines last month when she was captured for being involved with ISIS. An educated girl from the province which is a symbol of peace and love and Sufi scholars had joined ISIS and was set to suicide attack a church on Easter. She allegedly met a man through Facebook who lured her into joining the group. She disappeared, travelled to Syria, married another terrorist and returned to Pakistan to carry out her mission. The potential Black Mirror episode could revolve around her family and friends trying to find her, and the mystery of what urged Laghari to go in that direction.

6) Ramazan ban on eating/drinking in public

Religion is a personal matter. The entire point of fasting is to not be affected by the tempting surroundings. If we are to remove the temptations in our surroundings, then what’s the point of fasting anyway?

It does not test a Muslim’s faith and actually shows how weak it is. We don’t even need to imagine a world where eating and drinking is banned during Ramazan because it’s happening right here. What you can imagine is the suffering of all those who can’t fast – elderly, sick, pregnant women, children, and how this ban will affect them. With the scorching heat waves this region is known for, it is bound to end with people dying due to dehydration and other factors. The ridiculousness and unsurprising level of public support for the ban screams Black Mirror at this point. I wonder how it would go down if a hungry child or elderly person falls victim to a mob.

Couple gets death over ‘blasphemous’ text message

This is sadly the dark truth of our fearful society. We go to curb anything and everything to protect our convictions. As we go about our lives mocking a stranger online or fighting our friend for questioning authority or common beliefs, we need to understand that the black mirror of our cellphones and laptops is actually showing a truer reflection of us than the dressing table mirrors.

396,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1375867/denying-entry-pakistani-fulbright-scholar-major-victory-war-terror-us/,Denying entry to Pakistani Fulbright scholar major victory in war on terror: US,2017-04-06,"US expose­s Pakist­an’s grand plan to bring down their countr­y by export­ing academ­ic terror­ists

Our cover has finally been blown. For decades, Pakistani students have managed to sneak their way into the United States secretly pouring millions of dollars in education fees into the US economy and adding diversity to their college programmes. For decades, top Pakistani brains have made sufficient breakthroughs in academic research in the US adding to their college departments. For decades, brilliant Pakistani professionals have graduated from top US universities to diversify and innovate the US markets.

But all this terrorism will now come to an end. The US finally realised our grand plan to bring down their country by developing their economy and opening up emerging markets for them.

Pakistani Fulbright scholar denied entry into the US despite valid visa

We were once the second-fastest growing and the seventh-largest ethnic group in the United States but clearly, we were just mooching off Uncle Sam and contributed absolutely nothing to the country. About 500,000 Pakistanis just sitting on the couch eating American doughnuts and planning the next terrorist attack in the country – it’s just that Pakistanis are lazy which is why 500,000 people have only managed a handful of terrorist attacks in the last two decades.

A Pakistani even almost managed to get a US President elected. Huma Abedin would have finally managed to put Hilary Clinton – an ISI agent – in the White House, thus fulfilling the decade-long Pakistani plan to infiltrate the upper echelons of the states.

Hillary takes a leaf out of Imran Khan’s playbook

We were so close – in Saqib Ali, Ali Sajjad Taj, Arif Alikhan, Shamila N Chaudhry we had mayors, advisors, delegates and representatives. They would have all come together at the right time to summon Captain Pakistan – he’s the superhero who is going to bring the US down to zero. Saghir Tahir even managed to get elected on a Republican Party ticket – a Pakistani-Muslim elected representative in the Republican Party? That would be like Bernie Sanders being named the new khalifa of ISIS.

Clearly, Pakistani academics have contributed nothing to the United States and all these people are simply terrorists in the making. I applaud the decision of the US to deny entry into the US to Zia Shah, a Fulbright scholar. Zia Shah wanted to teach empathy, well how can he do that without having faced extreme prejudice himself? If anything, the US is helping him experience something crucial to his education and training work. One must face extremism to help others facing extremism.

All his work in developing peace and empathy would have led to so much terrorism. We all know peace is only a euphemism for war – why else would the US claim to be the most peace-loving nation in the world? You want some peace? Here are some bombs instead.

Now Donald Trump is here to put an end to all this academic terrorism being exported from Pakistan. It is time to make the Fulbright program fully dim. No more H-1B visas for the top of class graduates, no more opportunities to bring their unique expertise and specialisation to America and no more curry. Face it, if it wasn’t for Britain and America, we would not even have curry. No Pakistani in Pakistan has ever had curry or naan bread – which by the way is just naan! That would be like calling it chai tea – wait a minute Starbucks does have a chai tea option.

Pakistan doesn’t need Starbucks

If Pakistanis didn’t want to become terrorists, why would they learn chemistry and aeronautical engineering in America? All these academics are simply pretending to be peace-loving. They are all covert spies. As soon as the global call to jihad happens Akbar S Ahmed will leave anthropology and raise havoc on America like The Mummy Returns – it will be a bigger disaster than Brendan Fraser’s career.

Ayesha Jalal will stop teaching history at Tufts University and start making the United States itself history. Adil Najam will leave teaching Geography and work towards wrecking geography – the Grand Canyon is about to get so much wider.

Farooq Azam will leave marine microbiology and accept his real secret identity – Pakistani Aquaman. Some time ago, he had to apply for asylum in the United States after he was repeatedly hunted by Baloch fishermen off the coast of Karachi.

10 ways to enter the United States if you’re a Muslim

Saleem H Ali will stop researching the environment and start working on destroying it. But wait, Trump already has that covered so we Pakistanis can do what we love doing the most – just sit back and watch doing nothing.

We all know ISIS simply stands for Islamabad School of Institutional Scoundrels. It’s about time we stop exporting these academic terrorists. These vile creatures are allowed to do their work here; maybe build a few more universities and colleges here too while they are at it.

397,https://tribune.com.pk/story/1336417/not-content-just-fighting-taliban-pakistan-pm-flies-turkey-fight-islamic-state/,"Tired of fighting Taliban at home, PM flies to Turkey to fight Islamic State",2017-02-23,"He is not the leader we want but much like Batman, he is the leader we deserv­e.

I salute Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for all the bravery he has shown in the past week. When Pakistan was being marred by daily terrorist attacks, our prime minister was at the forefront of the violence – safely hiding in the basement of his house in Raiwind.

A firm believer in the proverb that “silence speaks louder than words”, he reassured a frantic nation with his silence. Nawaz Sharif has even gone the extra mile of ensuring not only his vocal silence but also his physical one.

When the nation has been threatened by war from terrorist organisations, he has taken the confrontation head on by flying to Turkey for three days. He’s not the leader we want but, much like Batman, he’s the leader we deserve. Not content with just fighting TTP in Pakistan, he’s going to Turkey to fight the Islamic State also. If only the United Nations trusted him with the Middle East, even Germany would be Palestine by now.

Nawaz, Imran and Zardari share New Year resolutions

When people from around the country were picking up bodies from their shrines, their streets and their homes, they were at least happy in the knowledge that their leader was safe at his house enjoying a warm meal.

I am sure all the people dying of terrorism are happy to know that our economy is on the rise — nothing better than financial manipulation by Ishaq Dar and cooking up some books to placate the nation. So what if you are not safe anywhere in the country, a mythical number in a book somewhere is bigger than what it was last year.

It doesn’t matter that life for the peasant in Pakistan has not changed for centuries. At least their colonisers were better looking a century ago.

Lord Mountbatten did not pretend to care about the locals but Nawaz Sharif is the real man of the people. Whereas the British built rail roads to steal local resources and transfer them to the centre, our government has never done that. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) does not build railways – they are known for building roads. Roads that move goods from all over Pakistan to the centre to grow the economy. There is nothing similar to what the British were doing then and what the PML-N is doing now.

Sure there were no hospitals for the wounded of the Sehwan blast and sure when they got to the nearest hospital, there were no beds, adequate equipment, resources or personnel but the nation must appreciate how smooth the roads were on which all injured people were transported. With their dying breath, they must be thanking the government for those roads. If only I could travel through a few underpasses then I can die a happy person.

Don’t kidnap me. I’m not a liberal

Hospitals do not buy you votes. You cannot paste your picture on hospital beds. What this nation needs is roads because they vote on the basis of what they see not what they know. If they see a shiny bus, they are convinced the nation must be progressing. We are all ready to buy a one-way ticket to our deaths on that bus.

Who needs a Quaid-e-Azam speaking to millions to show them he is with them – people who do not even understand the language spoken by Jinnah but are reinvigorated by his very presence? Who needs a Mandela encouraging his supporters from prison? Who needs a Martin Lurther King marching hand in hand? Who needs an Obama, Merkel, Trudeau – leaders who speak to the nation after every calamity to ensue calm and reinforce the nation’s ideals when you have the serenity of radio silence?

You do not need words when you have bombs. How many people died last week? About 200? Alright then let’s bomb 200 “terrorists” and call it even. It does not matter if some of these terrorists we have known about for a while or if some of them are not even terrorists. As long as the nation sees action, they will forget about this tragedy next week.

It really is a matter of perspective anyway, who’s to say what the nation should be more outraged about – a bomb at a shrine or Sheema Kermani dancing at a shrine?

Here’s what Nostradamus predicted about Pakistan in 2017

I am sure we have seen the end of terrorism now that we have dropped a few bombs. From tomorrow, all our leaders will move with no protocol, they will have no need to block a mile of road each time they need to travel, they will not speak to the public behind bulletproof glass, their homes will not be guarded with our tax money, their homes will not stretch for hundreds of miles, they will not move with hundreds of people and tens of cars each time they need to move.

If all of that does not happen then know that they know the country is not safe. They are lying to you. They are all the same. The day you take their privilege away, the day you strip their protection, they will see how the rest of us live and they might want to change that – not for us but for themselves.

I salute Nawaz Sharif for his ability to stay so brave in the face of such adversity. I also salute Imran Khan for all his criticism of the TTP. I am sure the government and the opposition will no longer be in bed with terrorist organisations. After all, the real criminals here are the victims of terrorism or as Rana Sanaullah puts it, if people don’t gather and protest, they won’t get bombed in public places. Does he blame the people who die in bomb blasts for the attacks? Guess General Dyer is alive after all.
