Heroin is to drug addicts what foreign exchange (read dollars) is to Pakistan’s economy right now. When a drug addict enters a rehabilitation clinic, he often perceives the doctor as the enemy, stripping away the addict’s ability to experience joy in life. Asad Umar is in a similar position with the Pakistani people, as he weans us off debt and expensive imports. In this case, like the addict, it’s easier for us to fight the doctor instead of the disease. The irony is that the doctor only has one goal at heart: to make the patient feel better and live life to its fullest.

Asad Umar has emerged from whatever rock or container he was hiding under by presenting the mini-budget last week. His silence on a substantive economic policy in the first few days of government was confusing because he’s never been short of opinions while in the opposition. But it seems like Asad has taken the first few weeks in government to digest the enormity of economic challenges in front of him. Let us assume Pakistan is a family with 100 rupees of expenditure every month. We spend around 36 rupees on interest payments and another 18 rupees on defence. Our monthly income is around 80 rupees so we still borrow 20 rupees a month to make ends meet.

Asad’s mini-budget attempts to be pro-poor, pro-exporters (read industrialists) and tries to bring down the import bill in this challenging fiscal landscape. Yes, it hurts to have income taxes raised but the lowest income workers have been protected (and should continue to be protected by reducing indirect taxes). Gas and electricity prices have also been raised independent of the budget. While all of this sounds like Purana Pakistan, it’s actually good for the country. Asad has a thankless job at the moment but he’s doing the right thing. Much like a doctor forcing a drug addict to kick the habit, the next few months will be painful but Asad has taken the courageous way forward versus giving in to knee-jerk populist policies.

The only place where Asad deserves across-the-board criticism is for allowing non-filers to purchase real estate and cars. This is a step backwards and signals potential capture of the government by vested interests. The apparent reason — allowing overseas Pakistanis to make purchases — could have had other workarounds (hello NICOP). The energy and excitement going into raising funds for dams could have been channelled into getting Pakistanis to file taxes so we don’t have to beg every time the government needs money. For the first time, arguably in Pakistan’s history, people actually trust the government with their tax money. Now would be the time for a fresh start and encouraging people to pay and file taxes. The only way to break free from debt is to live within our means. Going to China or Saudi Arabia to avoid the IMF doesn’t cure our debt problem, it only masks the symptoms long enough for the problem to get worse.

The other critique of Asad Umar’s economic announcements has been how uninspiring and inside the box it’s been. This is true but partly unfair because of the state of the economy he inherited. One cannot expect a drug addict to find a job before he reforms his behaviour. It’s like saying a drug addict should just flip a switch and turn around his life. It’s not that easy.

Incredible, short-term pain is about to hit the Pakistani public if we want to get our finances in order and chart a path for growth. Subsidies on utilities will have to be eliminated slowly. A culture of tax paying will have to be nurtured. Jobs will have to be lost at public-sector companies to manage their haemorrhaging budgets. Once these interventions are made, we can move faster on our path to growth. The problem with Pakistan’s finances is that we always come to the brink and get saved by someone. If the drug addict is always rescued by family and never has his rock bottom moment of vomiting on the toilet floor trying to flush out his over- dose, the desire to change doesn’t come from within. The desire for change becomes circumstantial.

It’s important for leaders like Imran and Asad, who have the political and moral capital of being ‘clean’, to nurture a desire for genuine economic change in the country that is painful but worthwhile. If they don’t take the time to explain this to the Pakistani public, their reform plan will not have the political capital to sustain itself. It’s time to flush the addiction to debt and living beyond our means from Pakistan. That is the only path to foreign policy independence and sustainable economic growth.

NEW YORK: Sacha Baron Cohen is back and Sarah Palin is not amused. The US former vice presidential nominee and ex-Alaska governor has launched an extraordinary attack on the British comedian for duping her to take part in his new show.

“Ya’ got me, Sacha. Feel better now?” wrote the mother of five, once synonymous with the Tea Party movement on the far-right of the Republican Party.

Cohen, she said, “heavily disguised himself as a disabled US veteran, fake wheelchair and all,” for the interview that she was told was a “legit” historical documentary by pay-to-view American television network Showtime.

Sarah Palin says she doesn’t get sexually harassed because she carries a gun

“I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil, exploitive, sick ‘humor’ of the British ‘comedian’ Sacha Baron Cohen, enabled and sponsored by CBS/Showtime,” she wrote.

Palin said she ultimately walked out of the interview and slammed what she called the Cambridge-educated comedian’s “foreign commentaries” that disrespected the US military and middle-class Americans.

She called on Cohen, CBS and Showtime to donate all proceeds from the interview to charities that support American veterans.

In a final indignity, Palin accused the production team of “purposefully” dropping her and her daughter off at the wrong Washington airport, “knowing” they would miss their return flights back to Alaska.

Cohen first found fame in Britain in 2000 with “Da Ali G Show” that saw his wannabe rapper character interview unsuspecting public figures. The show later transferred across the Atlantic.

He followed a similar format with hit movie characters that include bumbling Kazakh reporter Borat and gay Austrian fashionista Bruno.

KARACHI : Satire is the use of humour and ridicule to expose people’s flaws in the context of socio-politics and other contemporary issues. Add to it the fact that an artist using satire to talk about a society’s deep-rooted issues must have something intelligent to say and show them the mirror in a careful manner.

Veteran humourist and writer Anwar Maqsood released the latest episode of his online series titled Anwarnama on April 22 and it intended to be a satire on Sindhis. Titled Aik Sindhi Ka Interview, it shows Anwar reading a skit featuring him and a ‘common Sindhi’.

In an attempt to be funny, the episode starts off with the interviewer asking the Sindhi what he does for a living and he responds, “Nothing, I don’t need to work because I am Sindhi.” It then describes how the Sindhi man enjoys living a lavish lifestyle, indulges in various vices and in theory, dies multiple times in order to avoid paying off debt.

The episode irked the entire Sindhi population, here and abroad and caused a massive online backlash. Although it has now been removed from social media after Anwar publicly apologised, it merely goes on to show people’s attitude towards the Sindhi community.

Aik Sindhi Ka Interview comes off as offensive just for the sake of being offensive and it isn’t the least bit funny. The veteran had nothing important and intelligent to say and did not look at people in a critical manner but relegated to, intentionally or not, reinforce the stereotypes about Sindhis that have been consistent in Pakistani entertainment and media for years. This is the lowest common denominator of humour one didn’t expect from a legend like Anwar.

Talking to The Express Tribune, The Sketches front man Saif Samejo revealed that Anwar and Moin Akhtar had always been offensive, even back in the days of Loose Talk. “They had episodes where Akhtar appeared as a Bengali or Pashtun. It’s nothing new and I have been speaking out about this for years but no one cares,” he said. “Our media and films always showed a bandit wearing an ajrak, which is a sign of ultimate respect in our culture. Sindhis even welcomed immigrants during the time of Partition with an ajrak. Diversity is the strength of Sindh, which is the only diverse region in Pakistan.”

I’m 75 now. I want to retire: Anwar Maqsood

Saif continued, “I watched this recent episode and I don’t understand how one can call Sindhis jahil when you live in Sindh. You sit alongside him and a Sindhi accepts you as part of the community. Sindhi is not just a government worker or a certain political party supporter, he is also Sachal, he is also Bhittai. Sindh is also the land which welcomes everyone whether Christian, Hindu or anyone else.” He added that Anwar had a substandard mentality and that he was still caged in that old mindset. “You are in Sindh now and you are Sindhi too,” Saif retorted.

Comedian Ali Gul Pir reiterated that Loose Talk had a lot of controversial episodes. “But there was no sensitivity back then. Now it’s different. He doesn’t narrow it down to a government worker or anyone but generalises and says ‘aik Sindhi’. When the first joke you make is that he’s lazy, you are clearly reinforcing a stereotype,” he said. “When I made Wadere ka Beta, it was centered on Sindhi wadera, not all Sindhis. It was made clear. If there is a wadera villain in a film, it’s not racist because every story needs certain characters. The point is that distinction be made and there should be no generalisation.”

Ali mentioned he could find lazy people everywhere and not only in Sindh. “There is a way to go about criticising society or people. But what concerns me is that nobody else in his team saw the problem in this video. Why should a renowned artist reinforce the same stereotypical ideas and divide people when we are going past the ethnic and sectarian conflicts here.”

TV personality and politician Mahtab Akbar Rashdi criticised the timing of the video’s release. “Maqsood is an intellectual satirist and has a way of looking at things. But now at this juncture we are getting sensitive about so many things, about culture, language, etc and we are intolerant about so many things, and taking everything personally. In this scenario, releasing this video shows insensitivity,” she said. “People are taking it seriously and Maqsood should know that people are sensitive about certain things regarding the land of Sindh. It’s not intolerance but because of love for their land. Sindhis can’t compromise about anyone talking about Sindh. When it comes to their culture, land and water, there is no compromise.”

Mahtab continued, “This could have been easily ignored but not at this time. I know he makes fun of everyone but this is just rubbing salt in someone’s eyes. Not every Sindhi acts like he showed. You are targeting an entire nation of people. It’s not humor, its humiliation.”

Anwar Maqsood’s ‘Siachen’: Mastermind Dawar Mehmood is back – this time with Sajid Hasan

Director Institute of Sindhology Dr Ishaq Samejo said it showed a biased and narrow-minded view of people. “This video isn’t only against Sindhis, but also Urdu-speaking community. It’s just trying to create a divide between us and this attitude is condemnable,” he said. “Sindhis have always been welcoming and loving towards others. For me, Maqsood hasn’t only diminished his status as a writer but also a human.” Ishaq called the episode “a third-rate satire, if it can be called satire at all,” and said that one of the founding fathers and statesman Liaquat Ali Khan initiated this attitude, which has now become a mindset. “He called Sindhi culture that of donkey-carts and the language of illiterates and uneducated. This is the privileged class whose attitude has prevailed for so long and is not acceptable.”

Director Benazir Bhutto Chair at University of Karachi, Sahar Gul, likened this attitude to a form of narcissism. “It’s a form of narcissism that my language, sect or culture is supreme. It leads to curbing of diversity and the last stage is that if you’re not like me, you should be killed. If he (Maqsood) had used the word Sindhi wadera, it could have been tolerated.” She said, “We are proud of our rural areas where agriculture is a big part of our country and our people. This is a social responsibility of the literati they should condemn the killers of the community, and remove bias from the community. But they don’t do this.”

Initially defending the video, Anwar said he had lived in Sindh since he came in 1948 and he respected all the greats and even knew some personally. In the video, he is seen holding a copy of Shah Jo Risalo and apologising to everyone for hurting their sentiments. “It worried me that I hurt people’s sentiments. I don’t belong to any political party and I knew Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari. Sindh is a land of love, where Sachal and Bhittai lived,” he said. “I apologise to everyone that my humour hurt my Sindhi brothers’ sentiments.”

Anwar Maqsood is a bigger and better writer than Woody Allen: Sajid Hasan

Anwar’s timely apology must be appreciated as he realised and retracted the video to fix the mistake. But the larger picture shows that the cause of concern isn’t only this video but that this attitude towards the Sindhi community has been going on for years. Comedy has been used to reflect on society for so long and it has the right to be offensive but only when it has something of value to say. I would personally be on board if Anwar’s piece was at least funny and painted a true picture of a common Sindhi or had done away with generalising the entire community. It’s like making a stereotypical Pathan joke. In this day and age, it’s not only unfunny, but rather crude and perhaps only has a place in local stage shows which feed on this low-taste comedy. It isn’t something one would expect from someone with a stature that Anwar enjoys.

Times are changing and today, even the slightest error can mount up to be a bigger issue. This small negligence, which could have been easily avoided on part of the veteran humourist, exposed the plethora of issues concerning stereotypical representation of Sindhis in local media.

Go out of our comfort zone and you realise, just like in every nation, there are people who are good, motivated, hardworking as well as lazy and corrupt. As Saif pointed out on Twitter that it wasn’t only about Anwar or Akhtar but about the venomous mindset that is prevalent. “Since we grew up, we have been seeing such a wrong image (of Sindhis) and every age has to prove that we aren’t like what you portray us to be. Pakistan needs to revisit Sindh and feel (and understand) what ‘Sindhyat’ really is.”

KARACHI: We are living in a time when reality seems to be in competition with satire – decimating the benchmark of what we hold true.

In a world of Trump and the Onion, it is tough to distinguish between truth and satire – sometime even a disclaimer fails to do the job. In a bid to find validation for their theories, people are open to believing everything they see and hear. The number of likes has become equivalent to proof of authenticity.

#MeToo talk pushes aside issue of harassment

So how does one follow? A panel comprising Zarrar Khuhro and Fasi Zaka discussed the phenomena in a session titled ‘Reality Catches up with Satire’, moderated by Nadeem Farooq Paracha at the ninth Karachi Literature Festival on Saturday.

“It’s impossible to keep up, reality has taken over satire,” Khuhro said. “We have to lower our standards of comedy to keep up with reality.”

When an audience member recalled the statement of Pakistan Peoples Party Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari vowing to bring back stolen money, Zarrar quipped, “This is genius! How do you top that?”

Highlighting a major problem with satire today, Zaka said we are now punching down at victims instead of punching up at the powerful. He explained that in the 1980s the target was General Ziaul Haq but today it was protesters at Faizabad.

“We have a base of people who largely agree with us,” he said. “We believe we are converting the other side but you cannot convert people by making fun of them.”

Paracha wondered whether gullibility was becoming the norm today. Khuhro’s opinion seemed to differ as he pointed out that opinions which were once confined to drawing rooms have been provided a public platform through social media. “People have always been the same; we were never patient.”

He argued that it was not an anomaly to say or do things that made little sense when you are young. The only difference is that there is no permanent record of us being ‘stupid’ on a public platform, he said.

Universities – a breeding ground for terrorists?

Speaking to The Express Tribune about the repercussions of using sarcasm to weigh in on issues, Khuhro said, “The speed at which your views are disseminated is much faster now – an ordinary person using Twitter can potentially reach an audience of millions, hence the backlash is magnified.”

The creeping self-censorship in the age of outrage has curtailed our ability to take on the ironies of today. Zaka believes most satirists are not doing their job to the fullest. “We have internalised some of the censorship rules,” he told The Express Tribune. “The satire we do is punching at the sanctioned people or institutions that we can make fun of, which usually serves a purpose of other institutions who are actually acting in fairly undemocratic fashion.”

Zaka was of the view that it was not the thought of offending the masses that was responsible for self-censorship, rather it was ‘the systematic state actions’ against those using satire to depict reality that sent a strong signal. “You may like it or not but it [the work] was nowhere in the realm of treason,” he said.

LONDON: British satirist Armando Iannucci has won critical praise in Britain for his latest film – a darkly comic look at the power struggle to succeed Joseph Stalin – but in Russia not all politicians share the joke.

One communist politican branded it “abominable filth.” “The Death of Stalin,” which stars Steve Buscemi, Jeffrey Tambor and Jason Isaacs, held its UK premiere on Tuesday night. As the title suggests, it features a scene depicting the Soviet dictator’s demise in 1953.

Russia invited to explore untapped Pakistan market

“The comedy is about what’s going on inside the Kremlin, the power struggle, you know, the frantic kind of fight for survival really,” Iannucci told Reuters.

“That’s where the comedy comes and the paranoia that’s going on as well. But the consequences of these people’s actions is what ripples out across the Soviet Union – we show that for real.”

There has been no comment from the Kremlin about the film. But communist members of the Russian parliament are calling for a ban on its release in Russia. Russian Communist party spokesperson Alexander Yushchenko, himself a parliamentarian, described the film as “abominable filth,” in an interview cited by the party’s website.

“Today’s support – including for Stalin and (state founder Vladimir) Lenin – is on the rise, first and foremost among young people,” he said. The film as yet does not have a Russian release date listed on the film industry website IMDB.com.

Russia supplying free fuel to Taliban in war against NATO forces, reveals report

Sergei Obukhov, another senior member of the Russian communist party, drew a similar conclusion saying the film was “a new form of psychological warfare against our country.” Stalin ruled Russia for three decades during which he is widely held responsible for the deaths of millions of people, many in the Gulag network of labour camps.

The image of the dictator appears to be going through something of a rehabilitation in Russia though. A poll by the Russia’s Levada Centre in June found that respondents considered Stalin the “most outstanding person” in history, followed by present-day president, Vladimir Putin. Iannucci has won dozens of awards for his foul-mouthed political comedies “The Thick Of It” and “Veep”, which centre on dysfunctional politicians in Britain and the United States

respectively.

Egyptian comedian, Bassem Youssef, has created a way to combat Islamophobia for Muslims across America called the “Muslim morning after kit”, reported Huffington Post.

Youssef, who is also termed “Egyptian Jon Stewart” is a terrific satirist, and he teamed up with entertainment site CAFÉ to bring Muslims the perfect gateway to protection against suspicion and discrimination. The kit is an innovative way to protect American Muslims “from anyone who may want to hurt you because they think you vaguely resemble a terrorist.”

Egypt’s inclusion to boost CPEC, says NA speaker

The parody video sheds light on the way in which racial stereotypes have endangered people, and the fact that Muslims encounter such stereotypes on a daily basis. The ‘kit’ includes American flags “to drape all over your house every direction,” a t-shirt that says, “one of the good ones”, and an audio exercise CD that help users sound more ‘white.’

In addition, Youssef has also included in his ‘kit’ a photo with the country singer Toby Keith, and a backpack patch that says, “just some books and a laptop.” The kit also comes with an audio recording keychain with phrases in it resembling, “I hereby condemn yesterday’s terrorist attack, and all terrorist attacks. Bye bye!”

Youssef added that the kit also comes with a “White flight” application that detects the location of people who have posted ‘alt-right’ Facebook statuses or joined such groups on Reddit. “If whites get close, you’ll know to take a flight as quickly as possible,” he adds.

Interestingly, this kit isn’t only reserved for the Muslims, but also those who ‘look’ like them. This kit is called “Vaguely Muslim-Looking Morning after kit.”

Visa for Egyptians aimed at preventing ‘terrorists’: Sudan

In addition to producing this satirical skewering of Islamophobia, Youssef has become the subject of a new documentary, “Tickling Giants,” chronicling his life as a persecuted political commentator in Egypt.

I am a lawyer who decided to be a comedian. I never thought my two worlds would collide so perfectly one day. I have used all of my legal knowledge and gone through the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) recently revealed report and now, I am going to translate it into Pakistani – a language all of us understand.

The JIT was formed to find what the sources of funds are

Translation: We wanted everybody to know conclusively how the Sicilian mafia works before making any decision. Hey – we are the Supreme Court – when have we ever taken haste in dismissing a government or legitimising an illegal government? We are completely independent of politics – look at JIT to keep you occupied!

The affidavits of Tariq Shafi are unreliable. His signatures are different

Translation: How lazy are you man? If you were going to forge documents, you should have at least signed all of them yourself. You made other people sign! You truly do live like a king.

The Ahli Steel Mills document does not exist

Translation: Nawaz Sharif claims his dog ate his office work.

Tariq Shafi said Shehbaz Sharif was involved. Shehbaz Sharif said he was not involved

Translation: Aah… another case of he said, Shah said – Shehbaz Sharif is lying and trying to ensure he does not go down with his brother. He is building an underpass for himself to get out of this flood but he will drown with the rest of them.

As ministers bash JIT, PM confers with top aides

No document proving business started with 100% loan

Translation: Chori ka paisa hoga.

The liabilities of Gulf Steel were cleared possibly through undeclared wealth

Translation: Please refer to the aforementioned chori ka paisa.

No document shown to prove how money reached Qatar, Jeddah, or UK

Translation: The Sharif family is engaged in something that rhymes with funny maundering – yes, it is money laundering. You win nothing – just like the Sharif family from this JIT.

The liabilities repayment would have wiped out any sale proceeds

Translation: Chori ka paisa + chori ka paisa – chori ka paisa x chori ka paisa = chori ka paisa.

Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif during his address to the nation stated that in 1980 this factory (Gulf Steel Mills) was sold for AED 33.7 million. This is not consistent with either the documents/records provided by the respondents or the findings of the JIT

Translation: So, if anybody wants to file an application declaring him to be not ‘sadiq and ameen’ and not fit to be a prime minister, we are ready to hear you out.

Moreover, no Imran Khan, we do not mean physically, is fit to be the premier – stop with the push-ups already.

Respondents story about Gulf is unauthentic, lacks substance and seems fabricated

Translation: Just like everything else they say – ye bhi jhoot hay.

JIT suggests filing NAB reference against Sharif family

Sales proceeds from Gulf Steel Mills never reached Jeddah, Qatar or UK

Translation: The Sharif family should have at least pretended they won “Who Wants to a Millionaire” a few hundred times.

The beneficial owner of the Neilson Enterprises Limited and the Nescoll Limited is Maryam Safdar

Translation: The Sharif family should have thought about protecting Maryam when they were distributing properties in London like it was candy to all of their children.

Maryam has submitted fake/falsified documents to the JIT, which is a criminal offence. Mr Hussain Nawaz and Captain Safdar have also signed these documents

Translation: At least the Sharifs will have company in jail.

Comprehensive report duly signed by Robert W. Radley(Radley Forensic Document Laboratory) London “I have identified the type font used to produce both certified declarations to be “Calibri”. However, “Calibri” was not commercially available before 31st January 2007 and as such, neither of the originals of the certified Declarations is correctly dated and happy to have been created at some later point in time”

Translation: The Sharifs clearly did not learn in school that ‘naql’ kay liye bhi ‘aqal’ chaiye hoti hay.

Mr Nawaz distanced himself from the apartments

Translation: Even the father who gave them the property does not want to get involved in the mess. Is the court to believe Hussain Nawaz invented Facebook and became a billionaire while he was a teenager thus was able to afford all these properties?

Complete JIT report on Sharifs’ offshore properties

Repeated changes in Hussain Nawaz’s stance indicates possible efforts to conceal facts

Translation: Jhoot pakra gaya.

True owners of the Sharif family were the Sharif family – Nawaz seems to employ his children and two BVI entities to conceal his true ultimate ownership

Translation: Like you know, like every wealthy Pakistani father.

“Mr Hasan Nawaz, in his statement before the JIT, explained that Mr Hussain Nawaz Sharif had sent him 2.4 million GBP to help him set his business without declaring the source where the money was coming from”

Translation: 324386304.00 Pakistani rupees. We are sure Hussain Nawaz earned this through his tech start-up. Sure 320 million can sustain thousands of livelihoods for years in Pakistan but it is peanuts for the Sharif family.

Hasan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz did not have any independent source of income till 2000

Translation: Yet he was distributing millions like Edhi.

Shahbaz Sharif’s reluctance to discuss Qatari letters

Translation: The junior Sharif thinks he will be able to get out of this sinking ship, or at least Hamza will be the next chief minister of Punjab but we are onto him. He goes down with the rest of him.

Al Thani Family did not own the Mayfair apartments

Translation: Qatar cannot even save them now.

Confirmation of fictitious sale/purchase agreements by the respondents

YANGON, MYANMAR: The editor of one of Myanmar’s top newspapers will face trial for defaming the military by posting a satirical article on Facebook, under a controversial law critics say is stifling press freedom.

Myanmar anti-Islam monk says barred from Facebook

Last month the army sued the editor in chief of The Voice, Kyaw Min Swe, for uploading a link to an article poking fun at the military’s leaders for sitting around talking while ordinary soldiers are killed. On Friday a court in Yangon sent him to the city’s notorious Insein prison to await the start of his trial next week.

Hopes had been high that Myanmar’s first freely elected government in generations would usher in a new era of free speech when they took power last year after half a century of military rule. But defamation prosecutions have soared since Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) came to power, with social media satirists, activists and journalists increasingly targeted.

Activists say various defamation laws are being used to stifle free speech and stop the media from criticising the government.

Kyaw Min Swe is being prosecuted under the country’s broadly-worded telecommunications law — known as “66(d)” — which forbids uploading false of defamatory information online. If convicted he faces up to six months in jail.

The writer of the article, Kyaw Swa Naing, was acquitted by the court on Friday because he did not actually upload his piece. Speaking to reporters outside court, he said the law “must be amended”.

“Journalists are being harmed very much. Although we do not know what the verdict will be for brother Kyaw Min Swe… he’s now being held in prison,” he added.

Dozens of journalists and free speech activists wearing white armbands and with painted faces protested near the court on Friday, displaying banners emblazoned with “press freedom” in red.

“The government is letting people and organisations sue journalists… using a (law) that should be abolished under the NLD,” protesters Phyo Wai said.

Facebook ‘ban’ of anti-Muslim slur sparks Myanmar outcry

The Voice article at the centre of the case poked fun at a military propaganda film called “Pyi Daung Su Thit Sar” (Faithful to the Union) lauding the army’s victories over armed ethnic groups.

The run-up to Pakistan’s upcoming general elections next year have taken an interesting turn, as election campaigns of Pakistan’s leading political parties have been leaked. Read the proposed pathways of PML-N, PTI, PPP and others to their possible victories and pick your winner.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)

Politics is temporary but Biryani is forever. We survived the past five years and so did you, let’s survive five more together. No more Panama, only nara pajama.

We promise to make more roads and import fancy buses to make it seem like the country is progressing. Look at all our metro buses; we are the most metrosexual party ever. Load-shedding will be over by 2019 promise, pinky promise.

No JIT can bring us down. Unless it is more than two hours, then Hussain Nawaz gets tired.

Elections 2018: ‘Make resolution of people’s issues a priority’

Just don’t look at all these flats we are buying around the world – those are just in case papa decides democracy time is over and we all need to stop pretending. Load-shedding will be over by 2020 promise, pinky promise. Maryam Nawaz > Hamza Shahbaz.

Promise everything and deliver nothing. Load-shedding will be over by 2021 promise, pinky promise.

When you’re with us, you’re family. Do your corruption. Do your murders. Do your terrorism. As long as nobody reports about anything, we won’t care. Just continue voting for us. As long as we have Punjab, we have nothing to worry about.

Remember when Shahbaz said he would drag Asif Ali Zardari through the streets? You have to give us five more years if you want to see that happen – we are saving that for the DVD special. Maryam Nawaz’s twitter > Imran Khan’s twitter

Load-shedding will be over by 2099 promise, pinky promise.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)

Imran Khan is neither Asif Ali Zardari nor Nawaz Sharif. Wait, what? You need more reasons to vote for us? Well, do we need to stand for anything when we can simply stand against everything?

The only tabdeeli that comes is the one in our political positions.

We have figured out what you don’t want. We have no idea what you want or how to even give it to you but, we agree with you that we don’t want what you don’t want as well so, we are on the same page then. All we know is that tabdeeli is coming; we have no idea what will happen when it is here.

How PML-N’s trying to win voter support in 2018 elections

Nobody cares if our party has the same guys as all the other parties just look at how beautiful Imran Khan is and he is single again. Nobody was going to vote for a 64-year-old married man.

Are you an electable? JOIN PTI! We can deal with your criminal records; corruption and complete lack of principles later, just get elected for now.

We will fight corruption because Imran Khan isn’t corrupt. Such logic, much wow.

We will fight terrorism because Imran Khan isn’t a terrorist.

We will fight India because Imran Khan isn’t an Indian.

So, basically just forget all policy and agenda items and just look at Imran Khan. Do you like what you see? Vote for us then! You don’t even need to know our names, just vote for the bat.

Also, the best jalsas. By far.

Don’t trust Javed Hashmi when he says the plan is to get two-three people killed. Trust us, we cannot win an election by just getting two-three people killed, more like 20-30 maybe.

Also Twitter trolls. So, so, so, many Twitter trolls. Facebook ka Prime Minister is a legit position ok.

Pakistan People’s Party (PPP)

Have you all forgotten the period of 2008 to 2013? Great! Then we are back again. Let’s pretend Asif Ali Zardari was never the president.

You know how sometimes you have a headache but then you get cancer for a few years and you forget that you ever had a headache because cancer hurts so much now? Well, the headache is back and after cancer, it doesn’t seem that bad.

Also look at how shiny Bilawal Bhutto is. He even speaks Urdu now – or what he thinks is Urdu. In the next update, we will also try to make him speak Sindhi.

Nawaz Sharif foreseen to win 2018 polls: report

Want to know what he stands for and what his policies are? He is Benazir’s son and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s grandson. Want to know what PPP will do once the party comes into power? Have we told you who Bilawal’s mother and grandfather are?

What are going to be our major campaign ideas? What? Do you want me to draw the Bhutto family tree for you? Also, we have the best political song. Admit it – you want to dance to it on your mehndi also. And of course, the most holidays because we have the most shaheeds.

Make Pakistan great again. Go back to the days when we got 10% of everything.

Also Zinda hay Bilawal – wait it was a secret Zardari strategy that was not supposed to be leaked.

Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)

We exist. No promise we are still a political reality. Remember the days we complained that we had our backs against the wall? Well now that we are giving Anarkali Company inside the wall that doesn’t seem that bad.

BUT…hey look at how we were victimised, if nothing else, have some sympathy and give us your cell phones, I mean votes. I swear, we meant votes.

Musharraf likely to contest 2018 general elections

Why are you even looking for campaign ideas? When have we ever had any? Just look at what your identity is and vote for it. If you don’t, we will send our karkun and they will vote on your behalf.

Also, don’t forget to take your CNICs back from us the day after elections. We can’t keep them forever – or maybe we can till, at least, the next Skype call from London.

We go from the wall to your Facebook wall. You know you want to share that cute Altaf Hussain video. The only thing more popular than puppies on social media are Altaf Bhai’s pappis – ek pappi idhar, ek pappi udhar.

Awami Muslim League (AML)

When you can buy the milk, why buy the Buffalo?

Jamaat-i-Islami (JI)

Look, we are PTI’s ally so we can’t be that bad right? And we are Islamic so if you are Muslim, you must vote for us.

We at least have an agenda. We oppose capitalism, communism, liberalism, socialism, secularism and Miley Cyrus. Mainly, Miley Cyrus – she has been used by the West as a wrecking ball against Pakistan. So what if Maududi opposed Jinnah and Pakistan. Pakistan exists now and we want some of that cake too now that it has been made.

Also, free ice cream for all the women (bought by their mehrams for them).

And no uncovered lollypops. Ever. Everyone except us is a kafir.

Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F)

What is our agenda? Depends – how much are you willing to pay?

Say no to Petrol. Only Diesel.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/1412053/sneak-peak-cpec-master-plan/,A sneak peak into the ‘CPEC Master Plan’,2017-05-18T09:19:52 GMT,"Published: May 18, 2017","Karach­i will soon be called China Town under CPEC

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was recently in China to participate in the ‘One Belt, One Road’ summit, which is ironic since his name and the word belt have never been used in the same sentence before. Many people have to tie two belts together and a nara with izarband each time when choosing to wear a suit. The struggle is real, people, especially for our respected premier.

At great risk to my personal well-being, I somehow managed to stick my hand in the pocket of PM Nawaz’s suit shalwar and pull out the longest term plan for the China-Pak Economic Dumbledore, I mean Corridor. I uttered Dumbledore first because the way China has convinced us that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a game-changer for Pakistan has to be magic. I would not be surprised if Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang tried giving Nawaz some ‘love potion’ the last time they met. There is a reason why their love is higher than the mountains and deeper than the seas, you know.

Pakistan highly attractive destination for investment: PM Nawaz

And guess what… the CPEC master plan revelations are truly shocking.

The Shan (soon to be called Shan-Ghai masalay) advertisement was just the start. The Chinese are planning to replace every kind of Biryani (mind you) in Pakistan with Chicken Manchurian. In many ways, the master plan is exactly like the advertisement; to lure neighbours into friendship with food. When the loving dadi in the advertisement tells the Chinese woman, “Isko apna hee ghar samjho”, she just smiles knowing that that was her plan all along.

You know Nawaz Sharif is involved when all it took to win people over was a plate of biryani – this is basically how he took office.

The CPEC master plan has a simple proposal for agriculture which can be summarised in just four words: We grow, they eat. Everyone who once laughed at the Chinese people for eating dogs will not be laughing anymore when they will end up eating all our crops.

The Chinese idea to increase agricultural exports to one of the most water-stressed countries in the world is genius! If all the water goes to the crops then none of the water will be left for drinking, which will cure all our population-related problems.

If the, soon to be implemented, one child per house Chinese policy does not seem to work in Pakistan then the scarcity of water will do the trick – and please. Don’t worry about how so many Chinese will fit in Pakistan because dil mai jaga honi chaiye, yaar.

China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: ‘Long-term plan’ to be inked soon

According to the plan, Karachi’s new name will be “China Town” and, in a reversal of fortune, Karachi will be the name of a restaurant in China Town. Lahore is to be called Lo Ho Ping, Gwadar is to be named Lo A Gaye Hum and Islamabad’s new name is Char Jao Ab Ling.

It is unclear what punishment the Chinese will give to those who shut down Chinese parlours in Islamabad. All the popular religious parties, who claimed communist parties could never win elections in Pakistan, are reportedly re-evaluating their beliefs.

The Chinese are also producing a sequel to the movie ‘Chalay thay saath’ now called ‘Chalay thay saath billion’. The movie revolves around sending the entire Chinese population into Pakistan and ends with the region being surrounded by the Great Wall of China. It is obviously fiction… for now.

The full surveillance system will ensure that Pakistanis do not do to the Great Wall of China what they do to every wall in the country. Huge sign boards saying saying ‘Great Wall of China par peshab karna mana hay’. In Mandarin. But that will not be a problem because soon it will be mandatory for all Pakistanis to learn Mandarin. The process has already started at primary schools.

The CPEC master’s master plan also reveals the internet in Pakistan will be replaced by cat videos. It envisions a deep and broad based penetration – which is what most Pakistani teenage boys also envision when they use the internet. No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram; the internet will just be billions and billions of cat videos.

The aim is replicate the calm that the people of Pakistan had when PTV was the only channel available. Just like Ayub Khan had videos of tractors everywhere. Even when the country was on the verge of a disaster, the nation remained calm because they watched videos teaching them how to drive tractors. What was the country’s domestic policy, you ask? People don’t know because when Pakistanis are driving tractors they are not thinking about the domestic policy.

In the same way, instead of worrying about their civil liberties and fundamental rights people will watch cat videos. The cuteness of the videos will distract them enough to forget about everything else.

It really is an ingenious plan — but they can’t fool me. I know exactly what the Chinese are up to…oh wait look at that cat video, it makes me completely forget about the East China Company.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/1410222/guide-pakistani-parents-kill-childs-curiosity/,A guide for Pakistani parents: How to kill your child’s curiosity,2017-05-16T09:34:29 GMT,"Published: May 16, 2017","A helpfu­l guide brough­t to you by the Pakist­an Parent­ing Associ­ation

A helpful guide brought to you by the Pakistan Parenting Association.

Most smart parents know that too much curiosity is a bad thing. Raising a child, especially an inquisitive one, is quite a challenge. We want our child to grow up to be a practical, well-to-do individual with an aura of respect and prestige. We don’t want them to become writers, artists or — Allah-na-keray — philosophers.

Here are a few ways you can keep those pesky questions to the minimum, and raise a successful, practical offspring who will conform to societal standards and make you proud!

1) Protect yourself first

Much like the instruction for oxygen masks on airplanes — protect yourself first, then protect your child. Try not to get yourself sucked into the curiosity trap, and try not to learn too much about the world — the more you know, the more you realize that you know very little, which in turn makes you curious, not unlike the child you are trying to discipline.

Every now and then, you may find yourself in a weak moment, contemplating a new idea for the sake of understanding the world. This is precisely the dangerous behavior you are trying to protect your child from.

Project for out-of-school children launched in Islamabad

Entertaining strange new ideas is like substance abuse — it’s very easy to get carried away. If you aren’t careful, you’ll find yourself interrogating your decades-old, firmly held beliefs that you’ve fought hard to keep intact; beliefs that have now become part of your identity. And your identity is your source of pride, so protect it at all cost.

2) Nip it in the bud

Don’t leave your child’s questions unattended. Childhood curiosity can be tenacious. Not answering the question right away only means the question will pop up again. Now, imagine if you were not around when the question came up. Other adults may encourage your child’s curiosity, or worse, answer your child’s question in a way that is unacceptable to you. The trick, therefore, is to think on your feet, and come up with an easily digestible answer the first time itself. Just make sure the answer does not contradict another unrelated answer you had given earlier. If you do this, be prepared for a volley of questions, precisely what you were avoiding.

Helpful tip: Don’t worry about being logical or realistic. Being the parent, you can literally make your child believe anything you want without much evidence or logic. Use your position in the relationship to your advantage.

3) Obedience

Your most important weapon in the fight against curiosity is obedience. This is a trait you need to inculcate in your child as early as possible. It’ll make things a lot easier for you, your child, and all the authority figures your child will be subjected to in the future — teachers, school administrators, religious authority figures, the government, the police, and the military. For a society, as for a family, to keep functioning the way it’s functioning without disruption, we need obedience. If it wasn’t for obedient children who grew up to become subservient adults, would Pakistan have made the remarkable progress that it has?

Footpath School children in Karachi dance their hearts out

Helpful tip: If you are a father, it helps to think of yourself as the ‘head of state’ and your offspring as the ‘subject’. Own the position — protect it, and make sure you and your position remain significant for a long time. If you are the mother, you are the deputy of the ‘head of state’. Your job is to always support your husband. If you have a difference of opinion with him, just ignore it, and set a good example for your child of how to be obedient.

Another helpful tip: Do not ever apologise if you make a mistake — it undermines your authority as a parent. In fact, according to some thinkers, it’s not a mistake if your heart was in the right place, and as parents, your heart is always in the right place. That’s just a fact. If you cannot resist the urge to apologise, make sure you downplay the mistake, and never use the words ‘mistake’, ‘sorry’ or ‘apologize’.

4) Use the fear of rejection

Tell your child that publicly questioning conventional beliefs will draw ridicule from relatives, friends, and coworkers. If they question things too much, they may even be ostracized. Even if they do so privately, questioning fundamental beliefs can trigger an existential crisis, which, as we all know, leads quickly to suicide. Give them examples of European philosophers, many of whom committed the grave sin of suicide because they wouldn’t stop questioning things.

So, it is best to be safe and not question things at all. Only accept new ideas if they, beyond doubt, support your existing ideas and worldview.

5) School

Don’t worry too much about what your child studies at school; most schools have evolved to feed information to and discipline future job seekers. Even that’s something they struggle to achieve in Pakistan, so there isn’t much to worry about.

Three children used as drug mules rescued

There is a reason schools focus on Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Math and English as opposed to Sociology, Government, Politics, Philosophy and Anthropology. The former are practical subjects that prepare workers of the future to secure jobs and support their families. The latter only get them worked up and upset about perfectly normal things like strictly-defined gender roles.

Occasionally, however, you may come across an idealistic principal or a teacher who has a liberal arts background. They may encourage the inquisitive nature of your child, so avoid educators and schools that have an idealistic inclination.

6) University

Another problematic situation arises when your child is ready to go to university. They may not agree with what you’ve decided for them to study, and may put up resistance. This usually happens if they have gained some emotional and intellectual independence, i.e. they feel it is okay for them to entertain ideas that they know you won’t approve of. This is dangerous territory.

If your child says they want to study literature, philosophy or sociology, you know you’re in trouble. Use whatever tactic you can to dissuade them. If they win, be prepared to deflect questions about your child’s career from inquisitive guests and relatives at weddings and iftar parties. While they go on and on about their son’s amazing job at Unilever, you’ll be struggling to recall what exactly your child does at the newspaper.

To avoid this situation be vigilant from the time your child is born. Keep idealistic relatives away from your child, and be especially vigilant of the child’s older cousins and friends. A category we often take for granted are science geeks — they are practical, smart and usually have jobs, but their ideas can encourage young people to be skeptical, to question conventional thinking, and to stop being intellectually complacent. Engineering graduates in Pakistan typically do not fall into this category, so don’t worry about them.

Find a university for your child that does not admit students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, or other categories of people you would not want your child to end up marrying. Exposure to the class system can also make a young adult become aware of the glaring inequality in society, and encourage them to question things. Stick with private universities where the environment is devoid of political thought, and students come from largely similar, well-to-do backgrounds. These universities regularly arrange pointless events to keep students busy, and give them a sense of belonging.

Helpful tip: If you feel that the university is too open-minded, or there is too much inter-gender mingling, or the girls are not appropriately dressed, gather other parents and approach the university management. Since you are paying the tuition fee, you are the university’s ultimate customer, not your child. No one understands this better than the university management.

7) Marriage

Try to get your daughters married soon after they graduate from university, and your sons as soon as they find a stable job (unless you need either of them to support you financially). Being unmarried with newfound independence may give your child space to contemplate and entertain interesting new questions, like ‘Why do people have children?’. Be mindful of what they are doing with their income; for example, if they buy too many books, you’re in trouble. So plan ahead and keep your son or daughter occupied with major life events, like their wedding, their first child, their second child… you get the picture.

Helpful tip: Although your child becomes an adult at the age of 18 and can legally do everything that adults can, like owning property, getting married to whoever they choose, and fighting for the country, it is advisable to not highlight the fact that they are now independent adults, much like yourself. Keep using the words larka and larki — as opposed to aadmi and aurat — to refer to young adults, until they get married and have two kids of their own, or until they start looking like they’re 37.

Remember that only the most obedient, practical and self-centered children will make it to the top in our society, bringing their parents immense pride and joy.

KARACHI : Whenever writers, film-makers or artists have explored the idea of a dystopian society, they always talk about it with reference to the future. We always think the worst is yet to come. In a paradoxical antithesis of the idea of hope, we most importantly want to feel safe in the here and now. “It’s alright so far,” we say. But what if it’s not? What if we are merely pretending that it is? What if the future is now and we don’t have to be afraid of the unpleasantness of the future dystopian world because we already live in it and as shocking as it may be, we are comfortable in it.

The increasing anger and frustration of this segmented world, the boiling paranoia of everything we don’t understand, and the technological invasion of our lives has turned us into the very creatures we read about in dystopian literature and feel afraid. “We are not them,” we say. But what if we are?

Gender equality: Educating women a must for enlightened society: Shehbaz

British television show Black Mirror deals with all the realities of our modern world and how we have become what we said we never would: paranoid humanoids who would steal someone’s oxygen to keep themselves alive. We have become the kind who inhales fear and exhales disgust. We live in a world where mob mentality overrules any laws and regulations. In literary dystopias, it is most often the government who is the controlling evil. But in today’s dystopia, it is the people. Mob mentality prevails and sanity is buried somewhere thousands of miles under the mine-filled land of distrust, hatred, and blind rage.

An interesting fact about Black Mirror is that it, in its own twisted way, predicted Trump’s presidency and even told a story of a fictional British prime minister having a ‘very’ close relationship with a pig. Coincidentally, knowledge of an uncorroborated anecdote between actual former British PM David Cameron and a pig was later made public. While the television show has made interesting social commentary on today’s perverted world, we wonder how it would look if it was made in Pakistan. If anything, recent happenings in the country have offered more than a glimpse of the bitter society we live in, and it would be interesting to see how the show’s creator Charlie Brooker would tackle them.

We discuss six recent happenings in Pakistan that would make for brilliant Black Mirror episodes.

We are Mashal Khan: Civil society comes out in support of slain university student

1) Qandeel Baloch’s life

Call her an attention-seeking wannabe model or a symbol for unapologetic independent women, Qandeel Baloch’s life surely fits the bill for a Black Mirror episode. It’s unsurprising, yet interesting to see how social media can change and even end lives. It was social media which hyped, mocked, and made Baloch a celebrity for no reason. It was social media that inadvertently caused her demise. We don’t even need to add fictional elements to make it a Black Mirror episode. A simple biopic with emphasis on the role of the internet and how its influence destroys lives is enough to make us reflect, at least temporarily, on our careless behaviour when we are anonymous. “We didn’t do it. They did,” we say.

2) Mashal Khan incident

The fact that Mashal Khan was brutally murdered not by the ‘lesser educated’ (generally believed to be more extremist-adjacent) but rather his own fellow university students and faculty, is evidence enough that education and technology don’t change man’s inherently violent nature. If anything, it merely enhances it and gives it different ways to implement it. We have moved on from swords and spears to guns and missiles. Yet, Khan’s story reminds us of our animal nature where a quick death isn’t enough to satisfy us.

It’s a classic case of mob mentality overpowering the general rules of a civilised society.

Imagine a world where it was legal for people to murder and maim anyone they perceive as guilty of a crime. What would become of the society where purging of sanity was encouraged?

Mardan university student accused of blasphemy beaten to death on campus

3) Yasir Hussain’s child molestation joke

Yasir Hussain caught heat when he made his life’s biggest mistake by joking about child molestation at a recent award’s show. Sitting comfortable in his home, he apologised and was largely forgiven. A couple of weeks later, the incident is largely forgotten as we dwell on our latest obsession. With our short attention spans, that’s what we do. We raise our voice on one issue, forget about it the next day and move on. But what if those twitter warriors were actually willing to go farther than typing 140 characters?

PHOTO: FILE

Imagine a world where governments don’t exist and all conflicts are solved by public trials where angry people decide what to do. Hussain would not go forgiven from the trial, even after hundreds of apologies. It’s cruel to imagine what would come of him, but it won’t be a surprise, given this is the direction we’re headed toward as a society.

4) Waqar Zaka’s beatdown

This may seem eerily similar to Black Mirror’s ’15 Million Merits’ episode from the first season. Television ratings and online views are all the rage. Brands, corporate companies and channels are willing to spend money on anything that goes viral. In the aforementioned episode, Bing’s rant about being sick of the slave-like society powered by ratings and constant distraction through entertainment shockingly earns him a television show of his own. Zaka’s incident may or may not have earned him sympathy or a new television show (along with his attacker), but it did earn him thousands of views, which translate as free publicity. It served as a good distraction for people and now it’s largely forgotten about. What if the entire episode with Zaka, his beatdown, and the eventual resolution of the conflict with his attacker landed him a series? It would not be far-fetched to think it could happen. In this day and age, free publicity (positive or negative) is like winning a jackpot. You’re sure to become popular for 15 minutes, or could end up drowning in your 15 million rupees.

5) Naureen Laghari

A medical student, Naureen Laghari made headlines last month when she was captured for being involved with ISIS. An educated girl from the province which is a symbol of peace and love and Sufi scholars had joined ISIS and was set to suicide attack a church on Easter. She allegedly met a man through Facebook who lured her into joining the group. She disappeared, travelled to Syria, married another terrorist and returned to Pakistan to carry out her mission. The potential Black Mirror episode could revolve around her family and friends trying to find her, and the mystery of what urged Laghari to go in that direction.

6) Ramazan ban on eating/drinking in public

Religion is a personal matter. The entire point of fasting is to not be affected by the tempting surroundings. If we are to remove the temptations in our surroundings, then what’s the point of fasting anyway?

It does not test a Muslim’s faith and actually shows how weak it is. We don’t even need to imagine a world where eating and drinking is banned during Ramazan because it’s happening right here. What you can imagine is the suffering of all those who can’t fast – elderly, sick, pregnant women, children, and how this ban will affect them. With the scorching heat waves this region is known for, it is bound to end with people dying due to dehydration and other factors. The ridiculousness and unsurprising level of public support for the ban screams Black Mirror at this point. I wonder how it would go down if a hungry child or elderly person falls victim to a mob.

Couple gets death over ‘blasphemous’ text message

This is sadly the dark truth of our fearful society. We go to curb anything and everything to protect our convictions. As we go about our lives mocking a stranger online or fighting our friend for questioning authority or common beliefs, we need to understand that the black mirror of our cellphones and laptops is actually showing a truer reflection of us than the dressing table mirrors.

Our cover has finally been blown. For decades, Pakistani students have managed to sneak their way into the United States secretly pouring millions of dollars in education fees into the US economy and adding diversity to their college programmes. For decades, top Pakistani brains have made sufficient breakthroughs in academic research in the US adding to their college departments. For decades, brilliant Pakistani professionals have graduated from top US universities to diversify and innovate the US markets.

But all this terrorism will now come to an end. The US finally realised our grand plan to bring down their country by developing their economy and opening up emerging markets for them.

Pakistani Fulbright scholar denied entry into the US despite valid visa

We were once the second-fastest growing and the seventh-largest ethnic group in the United States but clearly, we were just mooching off Uncle Sam and contributed absolutely nothing to the country. About 500,000 Pakistanis just sitting on the couch eating American doughnuts and planning the next terrorist attack in the country – it’s just that Pakistanis are lazy which is why 500,000 people have only managed a handful of terrorist attacks in the last two decades.

A Pakistani even almost managed to get a US President elected. Huma Abedin would have finally managed to put Hilary Clinton – an ISI agent – in the White House, thus fulfilling the decade-long Pakistani plan to infiltrate the upper echelons of the states.

Hillary takes a leaf out of Imran Khan’s playbook

We were so close – in Saqib Ali, Ali Sajjad Taj, Arif Alikhan, Shamila N Chaudhry we had mayors, advisors, delegates and representatives. They would have all come together at the right time to summon Captain Pakistan – he’s the superhero who is going to bring the US down to zero. Saghir Tahir even managed to get elected on a Republican Party ticket – a Pakistani-Muslim elected representative in the Republican Party? That would be like Bernie Sanders being named the new khalifa of ISIS.

Clearly, Pakistani academics have contributed nothing to the United States and all these people are simply terrorists in the making. I applaud the decision of the US to deny entry into the US to Zia Shah, a Fulbright scholar. Zia Shah wanted to teach empathy, well how can he do that without having faced extreme prejudice himself? If anything, the US is helping him experience something crucial to his education and training work. One must face extremism to help others facing extremism.

All his work in developing peace and empathy would have led to so much terrorism. We all know peace is only a euphemism for war – why else would the US claim to be the most peace-loving nation in the world? You want some peace? Here are some bombs instead.

Now Donald Trump is here to put an end to all this academic terrorism being exported from Pakistan. It is time to make the Fulbright program fully dim. No more H-1B visas for the top of class graduates, no more opportunities to bring their unique expertise and specialisation to America and no more curry. Face it, if it wasn’t for Britain and America, we would not even have curry. No Pakistani in Pakistan has ever had curry or naan bread – which by the way is just naan! That would be like calling it chai tea – wait a minute Starbucks does have a chai tea option.

Pakistan doesn’t need Starbucks

If Pakistanis didn’t want to become terrorists, why would they learn chemistry and aeronautical engineering in America? All these academics are simply pretending to be peace-loving. They are all covert spies. As soon as the global call to jihad happens Akbar S Ahmed will leave anthropology and raise havoc on America like The Mummy Returns – it will be a bigger disaster than Brendan Fraser’s career.

Ayesha Jalal will stop teaching history at Tufts University and start making the United States itself history. Adil Najam will leave teaching Geography and work towards wrecking geography – the Grand Canyon is about to get so much wider.

Farooq Azam will leave marine microbiology and accept his real secret identity – Pakistani Aquaman. Some time ago, he had to apply for asylum in the United States after he was repeatedly hunted by Baloch fishermen off the coast of Karachi.

10 ways to enter the United States if you’re a Muslim

Saleem H Ali will stop researching the environment and start working on destroying it. But wait, Trump already has that covered so we Pakistanis can do what we love doing the most – just sit back and watch doing nothing.

We all know ISIS simply stands for Islamabad School of Institutional Scoundrels. It’s about time we stop exporting these academic terrorists. These vile creatures are allowed to do their work here; maybe build a few more universities and colleges here too while they are at it.

I salute Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for all the bravery he has shown in the past week. When Pakistan was being marred by daily terrorist attacks, our prime minister was at the forefront of the violence – safely hiding in the basement of his house in Raiwind.

A firm believer in the proverb that “silence speaks louder than words”, he reassured a frantic nation with his silence. Nawaz Sharif has even gone the extra mile of ensuring not only his vocal silence but also his physical one.

When the nation has been threatened by war from terrorist organisations, he has taken the confrontation head on by flying to Turkey for three days. He’s not the leader we want but, much like Batman, he’s the leader we deserve. Not content with just fighting TTP in Pakistan, he’s going to Turkey to fight the Islamic State also. If only the United Nations trusted him with the Middle East, even Germany would be Palestine by now.

Nawaz, Imran and Zardari share New Year resolutions

When people from around the country were picking up bodies from their shrines, their streets and their homes, they were at least happy in the knowledge that their leader was safe at his house enjoying a warm meal.

I am sure all the people dying of terrorism are happy to know that our economy is on the rise — nothing better than financial manipulation by Ishaq Dar and cooking up some books to placate the nation. So what if you are not safe anywhere in the country, a mythical number in a book somewhere is bigger than what it was last year.

It doesn’t matter that life for the peasant in Pakistan has not changed for centuries. At least their colonisers were better looking a century ago.

Lord Mountbatten did not pretend to care about the locals but Nawaz Sharif is the real man of the people. Whereas the British built rail roads to steal local resources and transfer them to the centre, our government has never done that. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) does not build railways – they are known for building roads. Roads that move goods from all over Pakistan to the centre to grow the economy. There is nothing similar to what the British were doing then and what the PML-N is doing now.

Sure there were no hospitals for the wounded of the Sehwan blast and sure when they got to the nearest hospital, there were no beds, adequate equipment, resources or personnel but the nation must appreciate how smooth the roads were on which all injured people were transported. With their dying breath, they must be thanking the government for those roads. If only I could travel through a few underpasses then I can die a happy person.

Don’t kidnap me. I’m not a liberal

Hospitals do not buy you votes. You cannot paste your picture on hospital beds. What this nation needs is roads because they vote on the basis of what they see not what they know. If they see a shiny bus, they are convinced the nation must be progressing. We are all ready to buy a one-way ticket to our deaths on that bus.

Who needs a Quaid-e-Azam speaking to millions to show them he is with them – people who do not even understand the language spoken by Jinnah but are reinvigorated by his very presence? Who needs a Mandela encouraging his supporters from prison? Who needs a Martin Lurther King marching hand in hand? Who needs an Obama, Merkel, Trudeau – leaders who speak to the nation after every calamity to ensue calm and reinforce the nation’s ideals when you have the serenity of radio silence?

You do not need words when you have bombs. How many people died last week? About 200? Alright then let’s bomb 200 “terrorists” and call it even. It does not matter if some of these terrorists we have known about for a while or if some of them are not even terrorists. As long as the nation sees action, they will forget about this tragedy next week.

It really is a matter of perspective anyway, who’s to say what the nation should be more outraged about – a bomb at a shrine or Sheema Kermani dancing at a shrine?

Here’s what Nostradamus predicted about Pakistan in 2017

I am sure we have seen the end of terrorism now that we have dropped a few bombs. From tomorrow, all our leaders will move with no protocol, they will have no need to block a mile of road each time they need to travel, they will not speak to the public behind bulletproof glass, their homes will not be guarded with our tax money, their homes will not stretch for hundreds of miles, they will not move with hundreds of people and tens of cars each time they need to move.

If all of that does not happen then know that they know the country is not safe. They are lying to you. They are all the same. The day you take their privilege away, the day you strip their protection, they will see how the rest of us live and they might want to change that – not for us but for themselves.

I salute Nawaz Sharif for his ability to stay so brave in the face of such adversity. I also salute Imran Khan for all his criticism of the TTP. I am sure the government and the opposition will no longer be in bed with terrorist organisations. After all, the real criminals here are the victims of terrorism or as Rana Sanaullah puts it, if people don’t gather and protest, they won’t get bombed in public places. Does he blame the people who die in bomb blasts for the attacks? Guess General Dyer is alive after all.

Remember, the Emperor has no clothes.
